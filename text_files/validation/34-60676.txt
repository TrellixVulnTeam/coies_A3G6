                                                    I.  
 
        The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in 
the public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against 
Berdj J. Rassam (“Respondent” or “Rassam”) pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(i) of the Commission’s 
Rules of Practice. 1 
                     
         
                                                    II. 
 
        In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the “Offer”), which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the 
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the 
findings herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of 
these proceedings, and the findings contained in Section III. C. below, which are admitted,

Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant 
to Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial 
Sanctions (“Order”), as set forth below. 
        
                                              III. 
                                                 
       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that: 
        
       A.     Berdj J. Rassam, age 43, was at all relevant times a certified public accountant 
licensed to practice in the state of California.  He became Controller at <comp.>Peregrine Systems, Inc.</> in 
November <date.>2000</>.  He was promoted to Vice President of Finance and Chief Accountant in 
September <date.>2001</> and served in that role until he resigned at management’s request in June 2002.   
 
       B.     Peregrine Systems, Inc. was, at the time of Rassam’s employment, a Delaware 
corporation with principal offices in San Diego, California.  Peregrine’s primary business 
involved selling infrastructure management software.  From its initial public offering in April 
1997, until it merged with Hewlett-Packard in 2005, Peregrine’s common stock was registered 
with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(“Exchange Act”).  It traded on the Nasdaq National Market System  from its initial public 
offering until August 30, 2002, when it was delisted and quoted on the Pink Sheets.  In February 
2003, Peregrine announced the restatement of $509 million of revenue it had improperly 
recorded during the fraud.  
 
       C.     On September 14, 2009, a final judgment was entered against Rassam,  
permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 
(“Securities Act”) and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 
13b2-1 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 
13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder, in the civil 
action entitled Securities and Exchange Commission v. Stephen P. Gardner et al., Civil Action 
No. 04 CV 2002 (S.D. Cal.).  The Court also barred Rassam for ten years from serving as an 
officer or director of any issuer that has a class of securities registered with the Commission or 
that is required to file reports with the Commission. 
 
       D.     The Commission’s complaint alleged, among other things, that Peregrine and its 
senior officers fraudulently inflated the <item.>revenues</> Peregrine reported in its filings with the 
Commission and elsewhere.  Peregrine improperly recorded millions of dollars of revenue based 
on non-binding arrangements with resellers.  This ultimately caused uncollectible receivables 
from the non-binding arrangements to swell on Peregrine’s balance sheet.  The complaint further 
alleges that Peregrine’s management, including Rassam, improperly wrote off the unpaid 
receivables by falsely characterizing the write-offs as unrelated acquisition costs.  According to 
the complaint, by engaging in this and other conduct Rassam violated the antifraud provisions of 
the federal securities laws and the books and records, reporting, and internal accounting control 
                                                2

provisions of the Exchange Act. 
        
                                             IV. 
                                                
       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest 
to impose the sanction agreed to in Respondent Rassam’s Offer. 
                                                
       Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, effective immediately, that Rassam is 
suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant. 
 
 
       By the Commission.
