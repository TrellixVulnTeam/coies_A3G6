             Kenneth W. Haver, CPA


ORDER DENYING MOTION TO REOPEN PROCEEDING OR VACATE SUSPENSION 

                                             I. 

       On March 4, 2002, the Commission filed a complaint in federal district court against 
Kenneth W. Haver, a certified public accountant and formerly the chief financial officer of 
<comp.>Telxon Corporation</> ("Telxon"), seeking an injunction against violating the federal securities 
laws.  The complaint alleged that Haver "knowingly or recklessly violated or aided and abetted 
violations of" the antifraud, reporting, and recordkeeping provisions of the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934 and rules thereunder.  The complaint alleged specifically that Haver "caused Telxon 
to improperly recognize revenue for three purported sales transactions" on financial statements 
contained in a Form 10-Q for the quarter ended <date.>September 30, 1998</>, which "inflated Telxon's 
quarterly <item.>revenues</> by 23% and quarterly profits by 270%."  On March 13, 2002, Haver, without 
admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, consented to the entry of a permanent 
injunction.  The federal district court imposed the injunction, without the presentation of any 
evidence or the adjudication of any issue of fact or law, on April 9, 2002. 1/ 

1/     See SEC v. Haver, Docket No. 5:02 CV 414 (N.D. Ohio Apr. 9, 2002).  The court 
       enjoined Haver from violating Exchange Act Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) and Rules  
       10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder and from aiding and abetting violations of Exchange Act 
       Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 
       thereunder.  Haver also consented to, and the court imposed, a civil penalty of $75,000.

       On March 13, 2002, the same day as he consented to the entry of the permanent 
injunction, Haver submitted an offer of settlement to the Commission which stated that, "in 
anticipation of the institution of public administrative proceedings against him" pursuant to 
Commission Rule of Practice 102(e), he consented to a suspension from appearing or practicing 
before the Commission as an accountant.  The Commission imposed the suspension on April 24, 
2002 (the "Rule 102(e) Order"). 2/  The Commission based the suspension on the existence of 
the federal court injunction entered with Haver's consent.  Rule 102(e)(3) provides that the 
Commission may suspend from appearing or practicing before it an accountant who has been 
permanently enjoined, in an action brought by the Commission, from violating or aiding and 
abetting the violation of any provision of the federal securities laws or the rules and regulations 
thereunder. 3/  The Rule 102(e) Order made no findings regarding the misconduct alleged in the 
injunctive complaint.  Haver consented to the suspension without admitting or denying any 
findings, except that he admitted the permanent injunction had been entered against him.  The 
Rule 102(e) Order provided that Haver could apply for reinstatement after five years. 

       Haver now seeks relief from the Rule 102(e) Order.  According to Haver, "compelling 
new evidence" obtained in a related class action by Telxon shareholders against Haver, Telxon, 
and its auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PWC"), justifies such relief.  The "new evidence" 
proffered by Haver consists of PWC workpapers produced in the class action which suggest, 
according to Haver, that Telxon disclosed the three violative transactions to PWC.  Haver 
contends that "the Commission's finding that [he] acted knowingly or recklessly when accounting 
for [the three violative transactions] . . . was, to a large degree, supported by the testimony of the 
senior members of the PWC engagement team that Mr. Haver failed to disclose these 
transactions to the engagement team voluntarily and in response to specific inquiry."  Haver 
argues, therefore, that the "[e]vidence produced by PWC in the securities litigation . . . 
establishes that this testimony . . .  was false and otherwise not credible" and that Haver "did not 
act with a knowing or reckless intent to defraud."  

       Haver claims that he "did not have access to PWC's workpapers . . . in support of his 
defense to the Commission's charges" at the time of his settlement.  Haver asserts further that the 
Commission did not have access to "some" of these workpapers, noting that the judge in the class 
action lawsuit found that PWC had not "produced a complete set of workpapers to the SEC in 
good faith."  According to Haver, the "existence of compelling evidence (none of which Haver 
had access to at the time he consented to the Rule 102(e) Order, and some of which was 
unlawfully withheld from the SEC by Telxon's auditor) supporting Haver's position that he did 
not act willfully when misreporting the subject transactions, is a compelling circumstance 
supporting his request for equitable relief."

                                               3


       Haver seeks two forms of relief.  First, he seeks "reconsideration of [the Commission's] 
findings that Mr. Haver violated Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) and Rule 13b2-1 of the Exchange 
Act."  Second, he requests that the Commission "reconsider his acceptance of a suspension from 
practice before the Commission as a term required in settlement of all charges brought against 
him."  Haver notes that the Ohio Accountancy Board revoked his CPA certificate solely on the 
basis of his acceptance of a suspension from practice before the Commission. 4/ 

       The Division of Enforcement opposes Haver's request on the grounds that he has not 
"demonstrated compelling facts or circumstances that would support a grant of relief." 
According to the Division, "Haver does not present a basis for vacating or modifying the 
sanctions imposed in the Rule 102(e) proceedings," which were based, not on a hearing with a 
record, but on the consent injunction entered against Haver.  The Division notes that the 
revocation of his CPA certificate by the Ohio Accountancy Board was a foreseeable consequence 
of the Commission's suspension order.  The Division also notes that, as early as next April, 
Haver may apply for reinstatement to resume appearing or practicing before the Commission. 

       For the reasons discussed below, we have determined to deny Haver's requested relief. 

                                               II. 

       We have generally considered petitions to vacate orders imposed with a respondent's 
consent in the context of petitions to vacate administrative bar orders imposed in settled 
proceedings. 5/  In these cases, we have stated that our "long-standing approach to petitions to 
vacate or modify . . . reflects [our] statutory obligation to ensure that a request for relief or 
modification comports with the public interest and investor protection." 6/  The factors that guide 
this public interest/investor protection inquiry are: 

4/     In his reply brief, Haver states that his petition is "fairly characterize[d]" as a "request to 
       vacate the suspension from appearing or practicing before [the Commission]."

       Docket 347 (considering petition to vacate a bar imposed with respondent's consent after 
       respondent consented to injunction by a federal district court); Jesse M. Townsley,

       the nature of the misconduct at issue in the underlying matter; the time that has passed 
       since issuance of the administrative bar; the compliance record of the petitioner since 
       issuance of the administrative bar; the age and securities industry experience of the 
       petitioner, and the extent to which the Commission has granted prior relief from the 
       administrative bar; whether the petitioner has identified verifiable, unanticipated 
       consequences of the bar; the position and persuasiveness of the Division of Enforcement's 
       response to the petition for relief; and whether there exists any other circumstance that 
       would cause the requested relief from the administrative bar to be inconsistent with the 
       public interest or the protection of investors. 7/ 

Not all of these factors will be relevant in determining the appropriateness of relief in a particular 
case, and no one factor is dispositive. 8/  We have held that bars should "remain in place in the 
usual case and be removed only in compelling circumstances." 9/  We agree with the Division of 
Enforcement, which, as indicated, opposes Haver's request, that Haver's petition does not present 
such compelling circumstances. 

       We have noted previously our "strong interest" in the finality of our settlement orders. 10/ 
"Public policy considerations favor the expeditious disposition of litigation, and a respondent 
cannot be permitted to [follow] one course of action and, upon an unfavorable [result], to try 
another course of action." 11/  "If sanctioned parties easily are able to reopen consent decrees 
years later, the SEC would have little incentive to enter into such agreements.  There would

       entitle him to have the proceedings reopened after the issuance of an adverse decision")

always remain open the possibility of litigation on the merits at some time in the distant future 
when memories have faded and records have been destroyed." 12/ 

       Haver acknowledges that "the Commission, as a matter of policy, does not generally 
'revisit' matters that are closed," but contends that "the circumstances presented here warrant an 
exception to any such rule."  One such circumstance, according to Haver, is his claim that "the 
Commission found that he acted intentionally or recklessly . . . chiefly on the basis of the false 
testimony of members of the PWC engagement team that he did not disclose the[] [violative] 
transactions to his auditors."  Haver claims that his new evidence -- certain PWC workpapers -­
establishes that he made the appropriate disclosures and did not act intentionally or recklessly. 

       Haver misconceives the basis for our suspension.  The Rule 102(e) Order contained no 
finding that Haver acted knowingly or recklessly.  We based the order on the district court's 
injunction and Haver's offer of settlement.  Commission Rule of Practice 102(e)(3)(iv) provides 
that one who, like Haver, "has consented to the entry of a permanent injunction . . . shall be 
presumed . . . to have been enjoined by reason of the misconduct alleged in the complaint." 13/ 
The injunctive complaint against Haver alleged, as noted above, that he knowingly or recklessly 
violated the federal securities laws.  Haver, therefore, is deemed enjoined by reason of such 
knowing or reckless violations.  We did not, and were not required to, make any findings 
regarding Haver's misconduct, 14/ and so do not consider here whether Haver's alleged new 
evidence refutes such findings. 15/ 

       Haver also fails to appreciate the significance of his offer of settlement.  Commission 
Rule of Practice 240(c)(4) provides explicitly that a settling respondent waives all hearings, the 
filing of proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, proceedings before, and an initial

       petition to set aside a censure imposed by the Commission with respondent's consent). 

13/	   17 C.F.R. § 201.102(e)(3)(iv). 

14/	   Cf. Milton J. Shuck, 38 S.E.C. 69, 72 (1957) (finding it unnecessary to determine whether 
       respondent violated Exchange Act Section 15(c)(3) where court had enjoined respondent 
       from violating that provision because "the existence of the injunction . . . itself clearly 
       furnishe[d] a statutory basis for revocation of registrant's registration under Section 15(b) 
       of the Exchange Act"), aff'd, 264 F.2d 358 (D.C. Cir. 1958). 

15/	   We did not make any findings regarding whether Haver acted knowingly or recklessly 
       because such findings could conflict with the basis for the district court's injunction. 
       Haver could request that the court now vacate his injunction.  See Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 60(b). 
       We do not intend to suggest in this order any view regarding such a petition.

decision by, a hearing officer, and all post-hearing procedures. 16/  Moreover, Haver's offer of 
settlement states expressly that "[b]y submitting this Offer, Haver hereby acknowledges his 
waiver of those rights specified in Rules 240(c)(4) and (5) of the Commission's Rules of 
Practice."  Haver does not suggest that his offer to settle was not voluntary, knowing, or 
informed. 17/  Haver thus forfeited his opportunity to adduce his evidence, 18/ which would 
require evaluation at the hearing before an administrative law judge that Haver waived.  Haver 
may not now complain that the record is inaccurate or incomplete. 19/ 

       Haver contends that another circumstance warranting relief is the action of the Ohio 
Accountancy Board in revoking his CPA certificate "solely on the basis of his acceptance of a 
suspension from practice before the Commission."  According to Haver, "an automatic loss of his 
Ohio CPA certificate was an unforeseeable consequence of his consent to a suspension." 
Although, as noted above, one of the factors we consider in evaluating petitions to vacate bar 
orders is whether the petitioner has identified verifiable, unanticipated consequences of the bar, 
we do not believe that revocation of Haver's CPA certificate was an "unforeseeable consequence" 
of the suspension.  Ohio law provides that the accountancy board may "revoke, suspend, or 
refuse to renew any CPA certificate" based on the "suspension or revocation of the right to

17/	   Cf. Sargent v. Dep't of Health and Human Servs., 229 F.3d 1088, 1091 (Fed. Cir. 2000) 
       ("It is well-established that in order to set aside a settlement, an appellant must show that 
       the agreement is unlawful, was involuntary, or was the result of fraud or mutual 
       mistake."). 

18/	   See William H. Pike, Investment Company Act Rel. No. 20417 (July 20, 1994), 57 SEC 
       Docket 589, 590-91 (rejecting applicant's request that we either expunge an order entered 
       with his consent or allow him to litigate the issues in a reopened administrative 
       proceeding on the ground that he could produce evidence that his misconduct "was far 
       less significant than would appear" because regardless of the significance of any such 
       evidence, applicant had "forfeited the opportunity to adduce it"). 

19/	   See Edward I. Frankel, 52 S.E.C. 1237, 1239 n.5 (1997) (rejecting petition to vacate bar 
       order where petitioner contended that bar order "relied upon erroneous information" 
       because respondent "elected to settle the matter and did not develop the record further" 
       and thus could not "now complain that the record is inaccurate or incomplete"); Cf. 
       Gleason v. Jandrucko, 860 F.2d 556 (2d Cir. 1988) (refusing to set aside a settlement 
       despite plaintiff's assertion that evidence discovered in a subsequent proceeding revealed 
       that defendants perjured themselves at their depositions and concealed evidence because 
       plaintiff "voluntarily chose to settle the action" and could not "be heard now to complain 
       that he was denied the opportunity to uncover the alleged fraud" where "nothing 
       prevented plaintiff during the pendency of the prior proceeding" from attempting to 
       obtain the evidence that plaintiff believed impeached the defendants' testimony).

practice before any state or federal agency." 20/  Haver therefore was in a position to anticipate 
and foresee the action of the Ohio board.  The Ohio Board's action is not a basis for relief. 21/ 

       The other factors noted above that we generally consider in determining whether it is 
appropriate to vacate an administrative bar order also suggest that vacating Haver's suspension is 
inappropriate here.  The underlying misconduct alleged in the injunctive complaint involved 
antifraud violations, and "the fact that a person has been enjoined from violating antifraud 
provisions 'has especially serious implications for the public interest.'" 22/  The time that has 
passed since issuance of the suspension further militates against relief because even the five-year 
period after which Haver may apply for reinstatement has not yet elapsed.  Under these 
circumstances, and based on our consideration of the factors previously identified, it would not 
comport with the public interest or investor protection to vacate Haver's suspension. 

       Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the motion of Kenneth W. Haver to reopen the 
proceeding or vacate the suspension imposed on April 24, 2002, be, and it hereby is, denied. 

       By the Commission.
