1934 and Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing

       On the basis of this Order and Respondents’ Offer, the Commission finds 3
                                                                                that: 

A.     RESPONDENTS 

       1.       Dan Clasby & Company (the “Firm”) is a sole proprietorship and public 
accounting firm based in Beverly, Massachusetts.  The Firm audited Unitronix Corporation’s 
(“Unitronix”) financial statements for the company’s 2004 fiscal year ended June 30, 2004.  
Unitronix dismissed the Firm as its independent auditor on February 11, 2005. 

       2.       Daniel E. Clasby, CPA, (“Clasby”), 51, of Ipswich, Massachusetts, is a certified 
public accountant licensed in the state of Massachusetts since 1983.  Clasby was the engagement 
partner in connection with the Firm’s audit of Unitronix’s financial statements for the company’s 
2004 fiscal year ended June 30, 2004. 

B.     FACTS 

       1.     Unitronix is a New Jersey corporation with its headquarters in Greenville, South 
Carolina.  Unitronix’s common stock is registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) 
of the Exchange Act and trades on the Pink Sheets under the symbol UTRX.  For its fiscal year 
ended June 30, 2004, Unitronix reported revenues of $114,000 and total assets of $19,700. 

       2.     Unitronix has at all relevant times been an issuer as defined by the Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act of 2002 (the “Act”). 

       3.     The Firm audited Unitronix’s 2004 financial statements included in Unitronix’s 
annual report for fiscal year 2004 on Form 10-K, filed with the Commission on September 28, 
2004.  As part of that audit, the Firm prepared and issued an audit report dated September 20, 2004 
(the “Unitronix audit report”), which the company included in its 2004 Form 10-K.  The Firm did 
not collect any fees for the audit work. 

3 
       The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondents’ Offer of Settlement and are not binding on any 
other person or entity in this or any other proceeding. 

                                               2

---------------------Page 3---------------------

       4.      At the time the Firm issued the Unitronix audit report, it was not registered with the 
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the “Board”), as required by Section 102(a) of the 
Act. 

       5.      Clasby was the engagement partner on the Firm’s audit of Unitronix’s 2004 
financial statements.  Clasby participated in the preparation and issuance of the Unitronix audit 
report. 

C.     VIOLATIONS 

       1.      Section 102(a) of the Act provides that “it shall be unlawful for any person that is 
not a registered public accounting firm to prepare or issue, or to participate in the preparation or 
issuance of, any audit report with respect to any issuer.”4 

       2.      The provisions of Section 102(a) of the Act became effective on October 22, 2003.      5 

       3.      Based on the conduct described above, the Firm willfully    6
                                                                             violated Section 102(a) 
of the Act. 

       4.      Based on the conduct described above, Clasby caused the Firm’s violation of 
Section 102(a) of the Act. 

D. FINDI       NGS 

       Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that the Firm willfully violated Section 
102(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and that Clasby caused the Firm’s violation of Section 
102(a) of the Act. 

E.     UNDERTAKING 

       Respondents have undertaken not to request, demand, or accept, directly or indirectly, any 
compensation from Unitronix in connection with the audit work associated with the Unitronix 
audit report. In determining whether to accept the Offer, the Commission has considered this 
undertaking. 
                                                  IV. 

4 
       A violation of the Act or any rule that the Board issues under the Act is treated for all purposes in the same 
manner as a violation of the Exchange Act, including with respect to penalties.  Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 15 
U.S.C.A. § 7202(b)(1) (West 2002). 
5 
       Section 102(a) became effective “[b]eginning 180 days after the date of the determination of the 
Commission under Section 101(d)” of the Act that the Board was prepared to undertake its statutory responsibilities.  
The Commission made the required determination on April 25, 2003.  See Order Regarding Section 101(d) of the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Securities Act Release No. 8223, Exchange Act Release No. 47746, 2003 WL 
1956164  (Apr. 25, 2003). 
6 
       “Willfully” as used in this Order means intentionally committing the act that constitutes the violation. 
There is no requirement that the actor also be aware that he is violating a rule or statute.  See Wonsover v. SEC, 205 
F.3d 408, 414 (D.C. Cir. 2000); Tager v. SEC, 344 F.2d 5, 8 (2d Cir. 1965).

       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in Respondents’ Offer. 

       Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that: 

       1.     Dan Clasby & Company 

              A.      The Firm shall cease and desist from committing or causing any violations 
and any future violations of Section 102(a) of the Act.

        B       .     The Firm is censured. 

              C.      The Firm may practice before the Commission as an independent accountant 
provided that: 

                      1.     It is registered with the Board in accordance with the Act, and such 
registration continues to be effective; and 

                      2.     It has submitted to the Commission staff (attention: Office of the 
Chief Accountant) the Board’s letter notifying the Firm that its registration application has been 
approved. 

       2.     Daniel E. Clasby, CPA 

              A.      Clasby shall cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and 
any future violations of Section 102(a) of the Act. 

              B.      Clasby may practice before the Commission as an independent accountant 
provided that: 

                      1.     The public accounting firm with which he is associated is 
registered with the Board in accordance with the Act, and such registration continues to be 
effective; and 

                      2.     He has submitted to the Commission staff (attention: Office of the 
Chief Accountant) the Board’s letter notifying the public accounting firm with which he is
