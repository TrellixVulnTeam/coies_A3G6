Respondent.                                        :        
                                                                      :     
 
 
       On December 23, 2014, Thomas D. Melvin, CPA (“Respondent”) requested an 
extension to file a brief in support of the petition for review.  Respondent represents that 
the Division consents to this request.  The briefing schedule in this matter ordered 
Respondent to file his brief in support of the petition for review by December 26, 2014, 
with a brief in opposition due January 26, 2015, and the reply brief, if any, by February 9, 
2015.    
              Extensions of time are disfavored.  It appears appropriate, however, to 
grant an extension.   
        
       Therefore, it is ORDERED that the time for filing Respondent’s brief is extended 
to January 16, 2015.  A brief in opposition shall be filed by February 17, 2015, and any 
reply brief shall be filed by March 3, 2015.  
  
       For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.
