    BENJAMIN  SILVA, III,
 
17
 
           Defendant.
 
18
 

19
        Plaintiff  Securities and Exchange  Commission  (the "Commission")  alleges:
 

20                                  SUMMARY       OF THE   ACTION
 

21
        1.  This matter involves a financial reporting fraud  at <comp.>Tvia, Inc.</> ("Tvia" or "the Company"), a 

22
 Silicon Valley semiconductor  company.  From at least <date.>September 2005</> through <date.>June 2006</>, Benjamin 

23
  Silva, III ("Silva" or "Defendant"),  then Tvia's  Vice President of Worldwide  Sales, caused the 

24
 Company  to falsely report millions ofdollars in <item.>revenue</> on <item.>sales</> through the use of side agreements 

25  in which Silva typically promised  the customer extended payment terms and obligated Tvia to find a 

26
 buyer for any product that the customer was unable to sell. 

27
        2.  Silva knew or was reckless in not knowing that these side agreements made it improper 

28
  for Tvia to recognize  revenue on the sales, either under the Company's  revenue recognition policy or 
           COMPLAINT 
           SECV.SILVA 
---------------------Page 2---------------------

  1   in accordance  with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles  ("GAAP").  Thus, in order to carry out 

 2   his fraud, Silva concealed the side agreements from Tvia's  Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), its 

 3    Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"),  and the Company's  auditors. 

 4           3.  Silva also caused Tvia to misapply approximately $300,000 in payments from new 

 5   customers to pay down other customers'  past due accounts, in order to satisfy collection concerns 

 6   raised by Tvia's  auditors and avoid the reversal of previously-recognized  revenue. 

 7           4.  Silva's  fraud caused Tvia to materially overstate  its revenue for multiple reporting 

 8   periods, including for its second quarter of fiscal 2006 (ended September 30, 2005), its third quarter 

 9   of fiscal 2006 (ended December  31, 2005), its 2006 year-end results (March 31, 2006), and its first 

10   quarter of fiscal 2007 (ended June 30, 2006).  Before Silva's  fraud was discovered, Silva exercised 

11   and sold all of his vested Tvia options, netting over $300,000. 

12           5.  By engaging in the acts alleged in this Complaint, Silva, among other things, violated the 

13   antifraud provisions  ofthe federal securities laws, made or caused to be made materially false or 

14   misleading  statements to Tvia's  auditors, falsified Tvia's  books and records, and caused Tvia to 

15   falsely report its financial results.  The Commission seeks an order enjoining Silva from future 

16   violations of the securities laws, requiring him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains  with prejudgment 

17   interest and pay civil monetary penalties, barring him from serving as an officer or director  ofa 

18   public company, and providing other  appropriate relief. 

19                                       JURISDICTION       AND VENUE 

20           6.  The Commission  brings this action pursuant to Sections 20(b) and 20(d)    of the Securities 

21   Act of 1933 ("Securities  Act")  [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b) and 77t(d)] and Sections 21(d) and 21(e)   of the 

22   Securities Exchange Act   of 1934 ("Exchange  Act") [15 U.S.C.    §§ 78u(d) and 78u(e)]. 

23           7.  This Court has jurisdiction  over this action pursuant to Sections 20(c) and 22(a) of the 

24   Securities Act [15 U.S.C.  §§ 77t(c) and 77v(a)] and Section 27   ofthe Exchange Act [15 U.S.c.  § 

25   78aa].  The defendant, directly or indirectly, has made use  of the means and instrumentalities  of 

26   interstate  commerce, of the mails, or of the facilities of a national securities exchange in connection 

27   with the acts, practices and courses of business alleged in this complaint. 

28           8.  Venue is proper in this District pursuant to Section 22 of the Securities Act[15  U.S.C. § 

             COMPLAINT                                  -2­

  1  77v],.and Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa].  Silva resides in the Northern District 

 2   of California, and acts or transactions constituting violations occurred in this district. 

 3                                  INTRADISTRICT  ASSIGNMENT 

 4           9. Assignment to the San Jose Division is appropriate pursuant to Civil Local Rules 3-2(c) 

 5   and 3-2(d) because acts and omissions giving rise to the Commission's claims occurred, among other 

 6  places in this district, in Santa Clara County. 

 7                                             DEFENDANT 

 8           10. Benjamin Silva, III, age 48, resides in Fremont, California.  From September 2004 

 9   through January 2007, Silva was Tvia's Vice President of Worldwide Sales.  From approximately 

10   September  2001 to September 2004,  Silva was head  of Worldwide Sales for another public 

11   company~ 

12                                         RELEVANT  ENTITY 

13          11. Tvia is a semiconductor company based in Santa Clara, California.  During the time 

14   period of the fraud alleged in this Complaint, Tvia's common stock traded on the NASDAQ Global 

15   Market ("NASDAQ") under the symbol "TVIA," and the Company was registered with the 

16   Commission pursUant   to Section 12(g) ofthe Exchange Act.  Tvia's fiscal year-end is March 31. On 

17   January 30, 2007, Tvia issued a press release indicating that the market should not rely on any 

18   financial statements, earnings press releases, and similar communications issued by Tvia for its 2006 

19   and 2007 fiscal years.  On July 12,2007, NASDAQ delisted the Company's securities due   to lack of 

20   compliance with listing requirements.  On October 15, 2008, Tvia filed a voluntary petition for 

21   reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.

23                                             .Background 

24          12. Tvia designs and develops digital display processors for use in LCD and other high­

25   definition TVs.  Tvia sells its products into multiple channels, including to original equipment 

26   manufacturers, distributors, and end-users.  For Tvia's 2005 fiscal year ended March 31,2005,  before 

27   the conduct at issue, the Company posted $3.3 million in revenue. 

28          13. At all relevant times it was improper under GAAP and Tvia's revenue recognition policy 

            COMPLAINT                                -3­
            SEC V. SILVA 
---------------------Page 4---------------------

   1  for Tvia to recognize revenue on transactions in which Tvia promised to accept the return of product 

  2   in the event a customer did not want the product.  In addition, it was improper under GAAP and 

  3   Tvia's revenue recognition policy for Tvia to recognize revenue on transactions in which the 

  4   Company agreed    to provide substantial ongoing and future services as a condition of a sale.  Finally, 

  5   under Tvia's revenue recognition policy it was improper for the Company   to recognize revenue on 

  6   transactions that included extended payment terms over  90 days without CEO   approval. 

  7	                             Silva Had a Financial Motive  to Commit Fraud 

  8           14. When Silva joined Tvia in September 2004, he received options on 250,000 shares ofTvia 

  9   stock, with one quarter of the options vesting after one year and the remainder vesting monthly 

 10   thereafter for the next three years.  In May 2005, Silva received additional options grants.  Silva 

 11   received a 50,000 share options grant, again with one quarter of the options vesting after one year and 

 12   the remainder vesting monthly thereafter for the next three years.  Silva also received a 70,000 share 

 13   performance-based options grant, which vested only  if the Company achieved   $5 million in revenue 

 14   in a fiscal quarter by June 30, 2006. 

 15           15. As Tvia's Vice President of Worldwide Sales, Silva had three primary sales 

 16   representatives, one for each of Tvia's geographic regions:  China/Taiwan, Japan/Korea, and 

 17   Europe/North America.  However, Silva was intimately involved    in sales negotiations in each region. 

 18           16. On multiple occasions, Silva expressed his desire to generate great wealth for himself and 

 19   his sales team through Tvia.  For example, on November   13, 2005, Silva wrote to his sales team: 

 20          We   cannot afford to have an ego, we cannot afford to let pride keep us from 

 21          driving this stock to $5 then to $10.  We are in this to win and win big.  I will stop 

 22          at nothing to gaurantee [sic] that this one goes all the way. We have not missed a 

 23          number and we will not miss a number.  I will make you a lot  of money and 

 24          successful whether you want it or not. ...  PREPARE TO BE RICH....    NO 

 25          MATTER WHAT. 

. 26	        17. Silva also recognized that missing Tvia's quarterly revenue projections could cause the 

 27   Company's  share price to drop.  In a November 23,2005  e-mail to his sales team, after informing 

 28   them that Tvia had recently attracted its first stock analyst (who was projecting $2.2 million in 

             COMPLAINT 
                                                       -4­

---------------------Page 5---------------------

 .1   quarterly revenue), Silva noted that "if we come in less, our stock will suffer." 

 2               Silva Used Side Agreements  to    Improperly   Boost Tvia's  Reported  Revenue 

 3           18. Silva began entering into side agreements with Tvia's  customers at least as early as 

 4   September 2005.  Typically, these side agreements promised the customer extended payment terms 

 5   and obligated Tvia to find a buyer for any product that the customer was unable to sell. 

 6           19.  Based on his experience in sales, both at Tvia and in his prior employment, Silva knew or 

 7   was reckless in not knowing that such side agreements would make it improper for Tvia to recognize 

 8   revenue on a sale.  Thus, in order to carry out his fraud, Silva concealed the side agreements from 

 9   Tvia's  CEO, its CFO, and the Company's  auditors. 

10           20. For example, once, when asked by Tvia's  CFO whether he was entering into side 

11   agreements  with customers, Silva replied that "There are no side deals ...  , and you should not even 

12   say that." 

13           21. Silva also hid his side agreements from the Company's  auditors.  Tvia's  auditors met 

14   Silva at the end ofeach quarter  to discuss each and every outstanding receivable in great detail. 

15   During these meetings, which would often last hours, the auditors tried  to determine why customers· 

16   were not paying as expected, and yet Silva never disclosed his side agreements extending payment 

17   terms and obligating Tvia to find new buyers for any product that the customers could not sell. 

18           22. As alleged below, Silva entered into one or more side agreements in each quarter from the 

19   second quarter ·of Tvia's  2006 fiscal year through the first quarter of its 2007 fiscal year.  Silva 

20   caused Tvia to recognize revenue which it should not have ranging from approximately $220,000       to 

21   $3.16 million  per quarter, overstating its quarterly revenue by as much as 164.8%. 

22                          Tvia's  Second  Quarter ofFiscal 2006 (Ended 913012005) 

23           23. On or about September   22,2005,  Tvia received a written purchase order for $220,000 

24   from MicroNetwork  Korea ("MNK"),  a customer based in South Korea.  According to the purchase 

25   order, MNK promised to pay Tvia in full on or before December 31, 2005.  Based on MNK's 

26   purchase  order and other information available to Tvia's  finance department, the Company 

27   recognized  $220,000 in revenue on this sale for the second quarter of Tvia's  2006 fiscal year, which 

28   ended September  30, 2005.

             SECV.SILVA 
---------------------Page 6---------------------

 1           24. It was improper for Tvia to recognize revenue on this sale because it was subject to 

 2   additional  terms offered by Silva in a side agreement.  The side agreement was documented in a letter 

 3   from Silva to MNK dated September     20,2005.   In the letter, Silva promised that Tvia would grant 

 4   MNK    extended payment terms in the event that MNK could not obtain financing to pay for the 

 5   product  by December   31, 2005.  In addition, in the letter Silva promised that Tvia would "dispose" of 

 6   the product  in the event that MNK was unable to sell it to an end user. 

 7           25. Silva knowingly  concealed the existence of the September  20,2005  side agreement from 

 8   Tvia's CEO, CFO, and auditors.  As a result   of Silva's  fraud, Tvia overstated its revenue for the 

 9   quarter ended September   30, 2005  by $220,000, or approximately  14.3%. 

10                          Tvia's  Third Quarter ofFisca/2006  (Ended 12/31/2005) 

11           26. During Tvia's  fiscal 2006 third quarter, ended December  31, 2005, Silva entered into two 

12   side agreements,  one with MNK    and the other with MJL Technology ("MJL"),  another South Korean 

13   customer.  In total, the side  agreements  caused Tvia to recognize $335,000 in revenue which it should 

14   not have, overstating the Company's  revenue for the quarter by approximately   14.1%. 

15           27. On or about December   12,2005,  MNK placed a written purchase order with Tvia for 

16   $225,000,  with payment due in full within  90 days of shipment.  Based on  MNK's   purchase order 

17   and other information  available  to Tvia's  finance department, the Company recognized  $225,000  in 

18   revenue on this sale for the quarter ended December   31,2005. 

19           28. It was improper  for Tvia to recognize revenue on this sale to MNK because it was subject 

20   to additional  terms offered by Silva in a side agreement.  The side agreement was documented in a 

21   letter from Silva to MNK dated December     12, 2005. In the letter, Silva promised that Tvia would 

22   grant MNK nearly six months to pay for the product.  Silva knowingly concealed this side agreement 

23   from Tvia's  CEO, CFO, and auditors. 

24           29. On or about December   16, 2005, MJL placed a written purchase order with Tvia for 

25   $110,000.  According to the order, MJL agreed to pay Tvia in full within  90 days.  Based on MJL's 

26   purchase  order and other information  available to Tvia's  finance department,  the Company 

27   recognized  $110,000  in revenue  on this sale for the quarter ended December 31,2005. 

28           30.  It was improper  for Tvia to recognize revenue on this sale because it was subject to 

            COMPLAINT                                  -6­

  1  additional terms offered by Silva in a side agreement.  The side agreement was documented in a letter 

 2   from Silva to MJL dated December 15,2005.  In the letter, Silva promised that Tvia would grant 

 3   MJL up to 120 days to pay for the product.  Further, Silva promised that, ifMJL  could not sell the 
                                                                                             rd 
 4   product within 120 days, Tvia would "arrange for MJL to sell the product to a suitable 3 party  ...." 

 5   Silva knowingly concealed this side agreement from Tvia's CEO, CFO, and auditors. 

 6                          Tvia's Fourth Quarter o(Fiscal2006  (Ended 3/31/2006) 

 7           31. During Tvia's  fiscal 2006 fourth quarter, ended March 31, 2006, Silva entered into side 

 8   agreements with Advent Technology ("Advent"), MNK, Universal Technology ("EDT"), and 

 9   Sichuan Friend (also known as Hooray Electronics) ("SFD").  In total, Silva's conduct in the fourth 

10   quarter led Tvia to recognize approximately $1.6 million in revenue which it should not have, 

11   overstating quarterly revenue by 132.3%. 

12           32. On or about March 16,2006,  Advent placed a written purchase order with Tvia for 

13   $125,000, with payment due in full within 90 days.  Based on Advent's purchase order and other 

14   information available to Tvia's  finance department, Tvia recognized $125,000 in revenue on this sale 

15   for the quarter ended March 31, 2006. 

16           33. It was improper for Tvia to recognize revenue on this sale because it was subject to 

17   additiomil terms offered by Silva in a side agreement.  The side agreement was documented in a letter 

18   from Silva to Advent dated March   15, 2006.  In the letter, Silva promised that Tvia would grant 

19   Advent up to 120 days to pay for the product.  Further, Silva promised that in the event Advent could 

20   not sell the product within 120 days, Tvia would "arrange for Advent to sell the products to a suitable 
      rd 
21   3  party ...."  Silva knowingly concealed this side agreement from Tvia's  CEO, CFO, and auditors. 

22           34. On or about March 31, 2006, MNK placed a written purchase order with Tvia for 

23   $325,000, with payment due in full within 90 days after shipment.  Based on MNK's  purchase order 

24   and other information available to Tvia's  finance department, Tvia recognized $325,000 in revenue 

25   on this sale for the quarter ended March 31, 2006. 

26          35.  It was improper for Tvia to recognize revenue on this sale because it was subject to 

27   additional terms offered by Silva in a side agreerpent.  The side agreement was documented in an  e­

28   mail from Silva to MNK dated March 31, 2006.  In the e-mail Silva promised that at the end   of the 

            COMPLAINT                                 -7­

  1  payment tenn  Tvia would take back from MNK all or any portion     of the product that MNK did not 

 2   need.  Silva knowingly concealed this side agreement from Tvia's  CEO, CFO, and auditors. 

 3           36.  On or about March 30, 2006, EUT placed two written purchase orders with Tvia for a 

 4   total of $865,000, with payment due in full within 70 days.  Purportedly, some  ofthe product from 

 5   these orders was for EUT, while some was for two other customers, Nucleus and Sino American 

 6   Electronics ("SAC").  Based on EUT's  purchase orders and other infonnation available to Tvia's 

 7   finance department, Tvia recognized a total  of$865,000 in revenue on these sales for the quarter 

 8   ended March 31, 2006. 

 9           37. It was improper for Tvia to recognize revenue on these sales, for two reasons.  First, the 

10   sales were subject to additional tenns offered by Silva in a side agreement.  The side ag~eement was 

11   documented in a letter from Silva to EUT dated March 30, 2006.  In the letter, Silva promised that in 

12   the event that EUT could not "identify a customer projects [sic] to consume these products within the 

13   70-day period," Tvia would extend the payment period to    90 days and/or "arrange for EUT to ship 

14   the unused remaining products to a Tvia-designated customer or distributor."  Silva knowingly 

15   concealed this side agreement from Tvia's  CEO, CFO, and auditors.  Second, in or about March 

16   2006, Silva learned that both planned transactions with Nucleus and SAC had fallen through, that 

17   neither Nucleus nor SAC wanted the product, and that EUT had only agreed to store the product until 

18   Tvia could find another customer.  Silva knowingly concealed this infonnation  from Tvia's  CEO, 

19   CFO, and auditors. 

20           38. On or about March 30, 2006, SFD placed a written purchase order with Tvia for $257,000. 

21   Based on SFD's  purchase order and other infonnation  available to Tvia's  finance department, Tvia 

22   recognized $257,000 in revenue on this sale for the quarter ended March 31, 2006. 

23           39. It was improper for Tvia to recognize revenue on this sale because it was subject to 

24   additional tenns offered by Silva in a side agreement.  The side agreement was documented in a letter 

25   of intent signed by Silva dated April 27, 2006.  Silva and his sales team had been negotiating the side 

26   agreement with SFDsince  at least March 21, 2006.  In the letter of intent, Silva promised that, in 

27   exchange for SFD ordering parts from Tvia, Tvia would perform a number oftasks  for which it did 

28   not have the technical or logistical ability.  Under GAAP, the SFD sale was incomplete because it

---------------------Page 9---------------------

  1   required future performance by Tvia and therefore revenue from the sale could not be recognized. 

 2   However, Silva concealed this side agreement from Tvia's CEO, CFO, and auditors, and the full 

 3   amount   ofthe sale was improperly recognized as revenue in Tvia's  fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. 

 4                           Tvia's  First Quarter ofFiscal 2007 (Ended   613012006) 

 5           40. On or about June 28, 2006, SFD placed   an additional written purchase order with Tvia for 

 6   approximately $3.16 million.  Based on SFD's purchase order and other information available to 

 7   Tvia's  finance department, the Company recognized approximately $3.16 million in revenue on this 

 8   sale for the first quarter ofTvia's  2007 fiscal year, which ended June 30, 2006. 

 9           41. As with the prior SFD order, it was improper for Tvia to recognize revenue on this sale 

10   because it was subject to the side agreement documented    in the letter of intent signed by Silva and 

11   dated April 27, 2006. 

12           42. In order to carry out his fraud, Silva continued to conceal this side agreement from Tvia's 

13   CEO, CFO, and auditors.  As a result, for the quarter ended June 30, 2006, Tvia improperly 

14   recognized approximately $3.16 million in revenue, overstating quarterly revenue by 164.8%. 

15                            Silva Misled Tvia  and  Its Auditors  Concerning  the 

16                              Collectability of Certain  Delinquent  Accounts 

17           43. In late 2005, Silva learned that Tvia's  auditors were scrutinizing several instances in 

18   which customers were delinquent in their payments    to the Company.  Silva understood that, among 

19   other things, the auditors were considering whether  to require Tvia to reverse some or all of the 

20   revenue it had previously recognized relating to these delinquent accounts, on the ground that it was 

21   no longer reasonable to believe that the revenue was collectible. 

22           44. In order to mislead Tvia's  auditors, and avoid the reversal of revenue, on at least two 

23   occasions  Silva caused Tvia to misapply a payment it received from a new customer in order to pay 

24   down delinquent amounts owed by a separate customer. 

25           45.  The first instance concerns Ricom, a Chinese customer which by late 2005 was past due 

26   on Tvia invoices totaling more than $740,000.  In February 2006, Silva convinced another customer, 

27   Protech Perennial Limited ("Protech"), to submit a $100,000 deposit for a then-unavailable line   of 

28   Tvia chips.  On or about February 24, 2006, Tvia received a wire transfer from Protech for $100,000.

             SEC V. SILVA 
---------------------Page 10---------------------

  1          46. In order to convince Tvia's  finance staff to apply these funds to Ricom's  account, Silva 

 2   falsely claimed that Protech had wired the money on Ricom's  behalf, due to purported Chinese 

 3   government restrictions on Ricom's  wiring money out    ofthat country. J;3y this conduct, Silva mislead 

 4   Tvia's  CEO, CFO and auditors regarding the collectability  of past due amounts owed by Ricom. 

 5           47. The second instance concerns EUT and MPEG, two Chinese customers that owed 

 6   significant past due amounts to Tvia.  In June 2006, Silva convinced another customer, Datavision 

 7   (also known as Data International), to submit a $200,000  deposit against an expected future order of 

 8   Tvia product.  On or about June  29, 2006, Tvia received a wire transfer from Datavision for 

 9   $200,000. 

10           48. In order to convince Tvia's  finance staff to apply these funds to the accounts ofEUT and 

11   MPEG, Silva falsely claimed that Datavision had wired the money     on EUT's  and MPEG's  behalf, 

12   due to purported  Chinese government restrictions on Datavision's  wiring money out   ofthat country. 

13   By this conduct, Silva misled Tvia's  CEO, CFO and auditors regarding the collectability  of past due 

14   amounts owed by EUT and MPEG. 

15                            Tvia's Internal  Investigation  And Related Matters 

16           49. On January  30,2007,  Tvia issued a press release indicating that the market should not rely 

17   on any financial statements, earnings press releases, and similar communications  issued by Tvia for 

18   its 2006 and 2007  fiscal years.  Tvia had already issued one restatement just two months prior. 

19   Tvia's  November   22,2006  restatement aroseJrom  the Company's  inability to timely collect  or 

20   enforce payment terms on sales to certain  of its customers in Asia and a determination by the 

21   Company that sales to these customers should have been recognized on sell-through to end users, as 

22   evidenced by cash collection. 

23           SO. In the January 30 press release, Tvia noted the November  22, 2006 restatement  of its 

24   historical financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 and for the quarters ended 

25   December   31, 2005  and June 2006  to defer approximately $6.4 million of revenue originally 

26   recognized on delivery to certain customers.  The Company continued: 

27           In January 2007, the Company was provided with new evidence with respect to undisclosed 

28           side arrangements  affecting the payment terms and obligations with certain of its customers.

  1          The new review is part   of an independent  investigation  by Tvia's  audit committee to 

 2           detennine  the nature and extent  ofthese side arrangements,  identify the responsible parties, 

 3           and detennine  the appropriate  actions, including whether an additional  restatement of the 

 4           financial statements  for the above periods is required. 

 5           51. Soon after announcing  the internal investigation,  Tvia's  financial situation worsened and 

 6   the Company  thus never restated the transactions  at issue.
