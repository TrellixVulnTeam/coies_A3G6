     ACCOUNTING AT CONAGRA DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FY 2001 
 
A.     Goslee Caused ConAgra to Improperly Account for the Reduction 
              of At Least $23.8 Million of Prior Period Excess Reserves  
                                                 
              ConAgra Improperly Kept Prior Period Excess Reserves on Its Books 

       7.           As outlined in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 5, 
Accounting for Contingencies, at paragraph 8, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 
(GAAP) requires that a reserve be created, and that a charge to income be taken, if it is both 
probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably 
estimated.  Conversely, when a liability is no longer probable and reasonably estimable, a 
reserve should be removed from the books and income should be increased.  In addition, 
paragraph 14 of SFAS No. 5 specifically prohibits the acc rual of reserves for general 
contingencies or for [g]eneral or unspecified business risks. 
 
       8.           In its year-end Summary of Uncorrected Financial Statement Misstatements for 
FY 2000, ConAgras outside auditor identified a potential overstatement of legal and 
environmental reserves in the range of about $23.8 million to $51.5 million.2
                                                                             The outside 
auditor informed ODonnell and Bolding about this potential overstatement at the end of FY 
<date.>2000</> and provided them with the summary.  Contrary to the requirements of SFAS No. 5, 
ODonnell and Bolding declined to reduce any of the excess legal and environmental reserves at 
the end of FY 2000. These prior-period excess reserves remained on ConAgras books in the first 
and second quarters of FY <date.>2001</>. 
          
                    Goslee Reduces ConAgras Prior Period Excess Reserves  
        
       9.           On February 13, 2001, as ConAgra was approaching the end of its third quarter of 
FY 2001, the Company issued a press release, which it filed with the Commission on Form 8-K, in 
which it lowered its near-term earnings outlook due to sharply higher energy costs and a slowing 
economy.  In this press release, ConAgra disclosed that it expected its earnings per share for the 
third quarter of FY 2001 to be in the range of $0.18 to $0.20.  ConAgras stock price dropped 
almost 20% on the day after it issued this press release. 
        
                                                 
2
 ConAgras attorneys and other Company personnel provided the outside auditor with the exposure 
estimates and reserve account balances used in making this calculation. 
 
                                               3 
---------------------Page 4---------------------

       10.        Also in the third quarter of FY 2001, after he assumed responsibility for accounting 
at ConAgra, Goslee learned that ConAgras outside auditor had identified legal and environmental 
reserves that were potentially overstated in the range of $23.8 million to $51.5 million at least as 
early as the end of FY 2000 and in the first two quarters of FY 2001.  Goslee made the decision to 
reverse $35 million of ConAgras excess legal and environmental reserves to income in the third 
quarter of FY 2001.3
                       
        
       11.        Paragraph 13 of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 20, 
Accounting Changes, states that [e]rrors in financial statements result from mathematical 
mistakes, mistakes in the application of accounting principles, or oversight or misuse of facts that 
existed at the time the financial statements were prepared.  Paragraphs 36 through 38 of APB 
Opinion No. 20 require the correction of an error to be reported as a prior period adjustment where 
the correction has a material effect on current period income before the effect of the change or on 
the trend of earnings.  In addition, paragraph 18 of APB Opinion No. 9, Reporting the Results of 
Operations, requires a prior period adjustment to be reflected by adjusting the opening balance of 
retained earnings in the current period, and accordingly, to be excluded from current period 
income.    
        
       12. At a minimu     m, $23.8 million of the $35 million of ConAgras legal and 
environmental reserves that Goslee directed be reduced had been in excess since at least the end of 
FY 2000.  Goslee knew, or should have known, that the accounting for this portion of the excess 
reserves reduction was not in accordance with SFAS No. 5 and improperly increased ConAgras 
reported income before income taxes for the third quarter of FY 2001 by nearly 15%.  The 
earnings estimates from the analysts covering ConAgra ranged from $0.18 to $0.21 earnings per 
share during that period.  ConAgras reported earnings of $0.19 in earnings per share for the third 
quarter of FY 2001, met the consensus estimate of $0.19 per share.  Without the $23.8 million 
reversal to income of the prior period excess reserves, ConAgra would have earned only $0.16 per 
share.   
        
       13.        Goslee knew, or should have known, that ConAgra should have treated the removal 
of at least $23.8 million of prior period excess reserves from its books as a correction of an error 
and reported the correction as a prior period adjustment because the $23.8 million excess should 
have been reduced by no later than the end of FY 2000.  Also, the $23.8 million reduction was 
material to the Companys reported income before income taxes, net income, earnings per share 
and trend of earnings at least by the third quarter of FY 2001, if not earlier.  As a result, the $23.8 
million prior period excess reserves reduction should have been excluded from ConAgras reported 
income before income taxes, net income and earnings per share for the third quarter of FY 2001.   
        
       14.        Goslees decision to reverse the $23.8 million of prior period excess reserves 
caused ConAgra to fail to make and keep books, records, and accounts which accurately and fairly 
reflected its transactions; circumvented any system of internal accounting controls that ConAgra 
had to provide reasonable assurances that, among other things, its transactions were recorded as 
                                                 
3
 ODonnell and Bolding were aware of Goslees decision to reduce the excess legal and environmental 
reserves by $35 million.  
  
                                                4 
---------------------Page 5---------------------

necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP; and caused 
ConAgras books, records or accounts to be falsified.  
 
       15. The Companys Form         10-Q for the third quarter of FY 2001, which was filed on 
April 11, 2001, disclosed that the Companys financial results were positively impacted by the $35 
million reserve reduction and negatively impacted, in part, by a significantly higher bad debt 
expense at its Agricultural Products subsidiary (which included UAP).  The disclosure regarding 
the reserve reduction was misleading because ConAgra failed to disclose that at least $23.8 million 
of these reserves were in excess in prior periods.   
        
       16.        As a result of ConAgras inaccurate accounting for, and improper disclosure about, 
the excess legal and environmental reserves reduction, ConAgras Form 10-Q for the third quarter 
of FY 2001 was materially inaccurate.  Goslee reviewed ConAgras Form 10-Q for the third 
quarter of FY 2001, including the disclosure related to the excess reserves reduction. 4
                                                                                      As a result 
of the conduct described above, Goslee caused ConAgra to file a materially inaccurate Form 10-Q 
for the third quarter of FY 2001.   
        
B.          Hill Caused ConAgra to Improperly Account for Its 
              Reductions of Various Reserves in FY 1999, FY 2000 and FY 2001 
                                                      
       17. ConAgra acquired Beatrice       Company (Beatrice) in FY 1991.  Prior to the 
acquisition, Beatrice estimated that it had hundreds of millions of dollars of liabilities arising from 
tax disputes with federal and state authorities.  Beatrice recorded these tax liabilities as tax reserves 
on its books and ConAgra inherited these reserves as part of the acquisition.  After the Beatrice 
acquisition, ConAgra increased the tax reserves it had inherited from Beatrice by adding tens of 
millions of dollars of post-acquisition interest.    
        
              18.        Although ConAgra reduced the Beatrice reserves in years at various times prior to 
1998, by no later than the end of FY 1998, ConAgra no longer had any probable and reasonably 
estimable tax liabilities that justified maintaining the remaining Beatrice acquisition-related tax and 
interest reserves on the Companys books.  At that time, these reserves exceeded $181 million.  At 
various times during FY 1999, FY 2000 and FY 2001, at the request of either DiFonzo or Bolding, 
Hill completed and signed journal entries that improperly reversed to income or reallocated certain 
of the excess Beatrice acquisition-related tax and interest reserves.  For example, during the first 
and second quarters of FY 1999, DiFonzo and Hill signed accounting journal entries improperly 
reducing the excess Beatrice-related post-acquisition interest reserves to offset, dollar-for-dollar, 
additional unrelated, unplanned-for and unreserved-for inventory losses arising from ConAgras 
attempted sale of meat and poultry into Russia by over $33 million.   
        
              19.        In addition, from at least as early as the end of FY 1998 through the third quarter of 
FY 2001, ConAgra fraudulently and improperly used the Companys Estimated Liabilities account 
as a general, or cookie jar, reserve which was not in conformity with GAAP.  During this time 
period, ConAgra increased this reserve by millions of dollars by transferring into it miscellaneous 
                                                 
4
 ODonnell, Bolding and others reviewed, and they both signed, the Form 10-Q. 
 
                                                 5 
---------------------Page 6---------------------

excess reserves and accruals, and gains from the sale of certain ConAgra assets.  In addition, at the 
same time, ConAgra improperly used this reserve to offset current period operating expenses.  
 
              20.        By no later than the end of FY 1998, ConAgra no longer had any probable and 
reasonably estimable liabilities that justified maintaining the balance in the Estimated Liabilities 
account on its books.  On several occasions in FY 1999, FY 2000 and FY 2001, at the request of 
either DiFonzo or Bolding, Hill completed journal entries that improperly reduced the balance in 
this account to income or to offset current period operating expenses.  For example, in the first 
quarter of FY 1999, DiFonzo directed Hill to use the Estimated Liabilities account for claims 
arising out of a legal settlement for which no reserve had previously been created.  DiFonzo and 
Hill signed a journal entry reducing the account by over $9.6 million for the bulk of these 
expenses.  Also, after the end of the third quarter of FY 2000, Bolding and Hill signed a journal 
entry offsetting $6 million of unplanned-for and unreserved-for losses arising from a joint venture 
in South Africa in that quarter with a dollar-for-dollar reduction of the Estimated Liabilities 
account.   
        
              21.        Finally, ConAgra recorded certain reserves in connection with a restructuring 
charge in FY 1996.  In FY 1999, ConAgra transferred more than $24.4 million of unused FY 1996 
restructuring reserves from the books of certain of its subsidiaries to the ConAgra Corporate 
ledger.  ConAgra, however, failed to remove these excess reserves from its books by the end of FY 
1999 as required by SFAS No. 5.  By no later than the end of FY 1999, at least $24.4 million of the 
remaining FY 1996 restructuring reserves were no longer needed and should have been reversed.  
In the fourth quarter of FY 2000, at Boldings request, Hill drafted and signed the journal entry that 
improperly reduced over $24.4 million of the excess FY 1996 restructuring reserves by lowering 
the Companys FY 2000 restructuring charge by an identical amount, and thus increased income 
by that amount.   
        
              22.        Hill knew or should have known that ConAgra no longer had any probable and 
reasonably estimable liabilities that justified maintaining the remaining Beatrice acquisition related 
tax and interest reserves, the balance of the Estimated Liabilities account, and the at least $24.4 
million of the FY 1996 restructuring reserves on its books and that each of these journal entries 
was not in conformity with GAAP.  For example, many of the journal entries reversing prior 
period excess reserves to increase current period income or decrease current period operating 
expenses were not in accordance with SFAS No. 5, APB Opinion No. 9 and APB Opinion No. 20.  
Also, many of these journal entries had the effect of improperly increasing ConAgras income 
before income taxes, net income and earnings per share.   
 
             23.        Accordingly, as a result of the journal entries he made,  Hill caused ConAgra to 
 include financial statements that were materially false and misleading in the Companys Quarterly 
 Reports filed on Forms 10-Q for the first, second and third quarters of FY 1999, in its Form 10-K 
 for FY 1999, in its Quarterly Report filed on Form 10-Q for the third quarter of FY 2000, in its 
 Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for FY 2000, and in its Form 10  -Q for the third quarter of FY 
 2001.  Also, by signing the improper journal entries, Hill caused ConAgra to fail to make and 
 keep books, records, and accounts which accurately and fairly reflected its transactions; 
 circumvented any system of internal accounting controls that ConAgra had to provide reasonable 

                                                6 
---------------------Page 7---------------------

 assurances that, among other things, its transactions were recorded as necessary to permit 
 preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP; and caused ConAgras books, 
 records or accounts to be falsified. 
                                                 
                       FEDERAL SECURITIES LAW VIOLATIONS 
 
C.         Goslee and Hill Caused ConAgra to  
              Violate the Reporting Provisions of the Exchange Act 
 
       24.        Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder, require 
issuers whose securities are registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12 of the 
Exchange Act to file annual and quarterly reports with the Commission containing such 
information as the Commissions rules prescribe.  These reports must be complete and accurate.  
United States v. Bilzerian, 926 F.2d 1285, 1298 (2d Cir. 1991); SEC v. Savoy Indus., 587 F.2d 
1149, 1165 (D.C. Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 913 (1979).  Rule 12b-20 of the Exchange Act 
requires that an issuers periodic reports include any additional information as necessary to make 
the required statements, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not 
misleading.  No showing of scienter is required to establish an issuers violation of the corporate 
reporting provisions.  SEC v. McNulty, 137 F.2d 732, 740-41 (2d Cir. 1998).  Information is 
material where there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider the 
information important in making an investment decision.  Basic, Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 
231-32 (1988). 
        
       25.        Section 21C of the Exchange Act provides that the Commission may issue a 
cease-and-desist order against a person who is a cause of [another persons] violation, due to an 
act or omission the person knew or should have known would contribute to such violation.  
Where the primary violations underlying a finding that a person is a cause of violations do not 
themselves require a finding of scienter, the standard of liability for being a cause of such 
violations under Section 21C of the Exchange Act is negligence. See KPMG LLP v. SEC, 289 F. 
3d 109, 112 (DC Cir. 2002). 
          
       26.        As a result of the conduct described above, Goslee caused ConAgra to violate 
Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13.  Goslees 
improper accounting for, and disclosure of, the reversal of at least $23.8 million of prior period  
excess  reserves caused ConAgras financial statements in its Quarterly Report for the third quarter 
of FY 2001, filed on Form 10-Q with the Commission on April 11, 2001,   to be materially false and 
misleading.     
        
       27.        As a result of the conduct described above, Hill caused ConAgra to violate Section 
13(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13.  Hills signing of 
journal entries reversing various excess reserves caused ConAgra to include financial statements 
that were materially false and misleading in the Companys Forms 10-Q for the first, second and 
third quarters of FY 1999, in its Form 10-K for FY 1999, in its Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 
FY 2000, in its Form 10-K for FY 2000 and in its Form 10-Q for the third quarter of FY 2001.

D.         Goslee and Hill Violated, and Caused ConAgra to  
              Violate, the Books and Records Provisions of the Exchange Act 
        
       28.        Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act requires reporting companies to make and 
keep books, records, and accounts which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect their 
transactions and dispositions of their assets.  Rule 13b2-1 of the Exchange Act prohibits any person 
from, directly or indirectly, falsifying or causing to be falsified, any book, record or account 
subject to Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(A).  No showing of scienter is required to support a 
violation of these provisions.  See SEC v. WorldWide Coin Investments, Ltd., 567 F. Supp. 724, 
749 (N.D. Ga. 1983); McNulty, 137 F.3d at 740-41. 
        
       29.        As a result of the conduct described above, Goslee caused ConAgra to violate 
Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act, and he violated Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1.  Goslee 
caused ConAgras violation of Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act, and violated Exchange 
Act Rule 13b2-1, when he directed the reduction of at least $23.8 million of ConAgras excess 
legal and environmental reserves in a manner not in conformity with GAAP.  The resulting 
adjustments to ConAgras reserve accounts and related books and records were false because they 
did not accurately reflect changes in the Companys probable and reasonably estimable liabilities, 
or the Companys current period income before income taxes, net income, and earnings per share. 
          
       30.        As a result of the conduct described above, Hill caused ConAgra to violate Section 
13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act, and he violated Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1.  Hill caused 
ConAgras violation of Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act, and violated Exchange Act Rule 
13b2-1, when he completed journal entries reducing various ConAgra excess reserves in the first 
and second quarters of FY 1999, the third and fourth quarters of FY 2000, and the third quarter of 
FY 2001 in a manner not in conformity with GAAP.  These journal entries, and the resulting 
adjustments to related accounts, books and records, were false because they did not accurately 
reflect changes in the Companys probable and reasonably estimable liabilities, or the Companys 
current period income before income taxes, net income and earnings per share.  
          
E.     Goslee and Hill Caused ConAgra to 
       Violate the Internal Controls Provisions of the Exchange Act  
 
       31.        Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act requires reporting companies to devise 
and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to reasonably assure that 
transactions are recorded and financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP.  No 
showing of scienter is required to support a violation of these provisions.  See WorldWide Coin 
Investments, Ltd., 567 F. Supp. at 749. 
        
       32.        As a result of the conduct described above, Goslee and Hill caused ConAgra to 
violate Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act.

        In connection with this action and any  judicial or administrative proceeding or 
investigation related to or arising out of any of the facts, events or transactions alleged in the Order, 
which is commenced by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party, each of the 
Respondents undertakes to cooperate with the Commission staff and:  (i) agrees to appear and be 
interviewed by Commission staff at such times and places as the staff requests upon reasonable 
notice; (ii) will accept service by mail or facsimile transmission of notices or subpoenas issued by 
the Commission for documents or testimony at depositions, hearings, or trials, or in connection 
with any related investigation by Commission staff; (iii) appoints his or her attorney as agent to 
receive service of such notices and subpoenas; (iv) with respect to such notices and subpoenas, 
waives the territorial limits on service contained in Rule 45 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 
and any applicable local rules, provided that the party requesting the testimony reimburses his or 
her travel, lodging, and subsistence expenses at the then-prevailing U.S. Government per diem 
rates; and (v) consents to personal jurisdiction over him or her in any United States District Court 
for purposes of enforcing any such subpoena.   
     
        In determining whether to accept the Offers, the Commission has considered these 
undertakings. 
                                                        
                                                     IV. 
                                                      
        In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in Respondents Offers. 
 
        Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that: 
 
 A. Respondent Goslee ceas                e and desist from committing or causing any violation and 
any future violations of Rule 13b2-1 of the Exchange Act, and cease and desist from causing any 
violation and any future violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange 
Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13. 
  
 B. Respondent Hill               cease and desist from committing or causing any violation and any 
future violations of Rule 13b2-1 of the Exchange Act, and cease and desist from causing any 
violation and any future violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange 
Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13.
