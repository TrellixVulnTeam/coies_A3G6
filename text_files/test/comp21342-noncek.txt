       Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission"),  for its complaint against 

defendant Theodore P. Noncek (tlNoncek" or "defendant"), alleges: 

                             NATURE   OF  THE  ACTION 

       1.    Noncek, Vice-President  and Controller of<comp.>Bally Total Fitness Holding 

Corporation ("Bally")</>  during the relevant time, violated various provisions ofthe federal 

securities laws. As described below, Noncek and others were responsible for Bally's  materially 

.false aild misleading state~ents about its·firia.ncialcondition in filings with the Commission and 

=;a:=:=:=~:;i:~)

and its performance (its net inco~e) ~bekgnud:eriallybetter than they actually were during the ... 

relevant period, and also failed to <lisclose the reasons for certain recorded adjustments and 

accounting changes. 
---------------------Page 2---------------------

       2.      Bally's  misrepresentations  about its financial condition and perfonnance,  for 

which Noncek  was, with others, responsible,  were the result of Bally's employment of 

accounting  methods that were not in confonnity  with generally accepted accounting  principles 

("GAAP")  and were fraudulent.   On November   30,2005,  Bally filed its 2004 Fonn 10-K, which 

restated its previously reported financial statements  for the years ended <date.>December 31, 2002</>, and 

<date.>2003</>, and restated selected financial data for the years ended <date.>December 31,2001</>,  and 

<date.>December  31, 2000</>. 

       3.      Those accounting  improprieties  had a material effect on the accuracy of Bally's 

financial statements.  For example, Bally originally  reported in its 2001 Fonn 10-K that its year­

end 2001 shareholders'  <item.>equity</>, or <item.>net worth</>, was positive $513 million. In truth, Hally's year-end 

2001 net worth was negative $1.3 billion.  Simply put, Bally overstated  its year-end 2001 net 

worth by $1.8 billion. 

       4.      Bally's accounting  fraud and improprieties  continued  through 2003.  As a result, 

Bally understated  its origirially reported 2002 <item.>loss before income tax</> by $94.2 million.  Bally 

also understated  its originally reported 2003 loss before income tax by $90.8 million.  In addition 

to being included in the annual Forms 1O-K, these materially false and misleading financial 

statements  were also included'in  annual earnings releases filed  as exhibits to Forms 8-K and in 
                  /] 
registration statements (andamendments thereto) filed  by Bally in 2001,2002,  and 2003. 

       5.      As a resultof the conduct described below, Noncek violated Section 17(a)(2) and 
                     .. '  '.                                    .      ..

Act, and Rules  lOb-5, 12b-20, 13a-l, 13a-II and  13a-13 thereunder.  The District Court issued

       11.   Ernst & Young LLP  ("E& Y") is a national public accounting  finn and, during the 

relevant period,  was Bally's independent  auditor.  E&Y issued unqualified  audit opinions  for 

each ofthe relevant  years. 

       12.   John W. Dwyer,  age 57, was Bally's  CFO from May 1994 to April 2004, when he 

was forced to resign.  Prior to the resignation,  Noncek reported to Dwyer. Prior to his 

employment  at Bally, Dwyer  was an audit partner  in the Chicago office ofE&Y. At all relevant 

times, Dwyer was a certified  public accountant.

                             Bally's Fraudulent Accounting
 

                                      Background
 

       13.   Bally became  a publicly traded company at the beginning of 1996, as a result of 

being spun off from its  parent corporation,  Bally Entertainment  Corporation.  At the time ofthe 

spin-off, Bally had a reported  accumulated  deficit of$52.8 million as ofyear-end  1995. 

       14.   Bally's  principal  source ofrevenue  was selling gym membership  contracts,  which

Bally's  biggest source ofrevenue. 

                                           4
 
---------------------Page 5---------------------

        15.    As Bally's  Vice-President  and Controller  for fiscal years 2001 through  2003, and 

 a required.signatory  to Bally's  annual filings with the Commission,  Noncek  and others were 

 -responsible for ensuring that Bally's  financial  statements  and accounting  were in conformity 

 with GAAP.  Instead  ofdoing so, however,  Noncek  approved of improper  accounting  practices 

 and improprieties  that served (a) to overstate  Bally's gross revenue,  and thus overstate  Bally's  net 

 income "(or understate  Bally's net loss); (b) to understate Bally's  expenses,  and thus overstate 

 Bally's net income (or understate Bally's net loss); or (c) to understate  Bally's  accumulated  deficit 

 as of December  31,2001, and thus overstate  Bally's net worth. 

        16.    In addition, Noncek was, with others, responsible  for Bally's  disclosures  relating
 

 to various accounting .  . adjustments ..anq accounting . changes. In that respect, Noncek 
                                                                  .            .  knew  or
 

 should have known that Bally's  disclosures in 2002 relating to certain recorded  adjustments  were
 

 false and misleading.
 

                              Bally Fraudulently   Overstated  its
 
                           Gross Revenue  from  "Reactivation  Fees"
 

        17.    As early as 1997, Bally recognized  revenue  from what it called "reactivations,"
 

 which were payments  from Bally members  who had completed  their initial contract  period,  but
 

 whose memberships  were canceled for failure to pay the monthly dues necessary  to maintain
 

 their membership.  Bally did not attempt to recover those dues because there was no legal
 

 obligation  to pay dues.  Accordingly, for those canceled  membex:s who had: completed  their

 offers did so, on average,  approximately 36 months  after:having  stopped paying  monthly dues. 

.The reactivation  offers did not contain claims  for or seek payment of"past due" amounts. 

 Instead, they asked for either a nominal  reactivation  fee or no reactivation  fee at all, and the 

                                               5 
---------------------Page 6---------------------

 payment  of monthly  dues for a period offuttire service,  generally  12 months. Bally's method of 

 accounting  for reactivations  was to project (as ofthe balance  sheet date) the reactivation 

 payments  it anticipated  receiving  during the coming  year and immediately  recognize  most of 

 these projected  payments by improperly  allocating  them to past periods. 

         18.    Bally's  method of accounting  for reactivations  was not in conformity  with GAAP 

 because Bally recognized  revenue  before  it was earned  and was realized or realizable.  Bally 

 recognized  revenue  before it was earned  because,  among  other things, it barred canceled 

 members  from the gyms, and therefore,  had  not provided  services  to those ofits canceled 

 members  who   might reactivate in the future.  Additionally,  Bally recognized  revenue  before it 

.. Was realized or realizable  because  it was recognizing  revenue  for reactivations that had not yet 

 occurred,  which it anticipated  from canceled  members whom  it could not identify individually 

 and who had no legal obligation  to reactivate or pay Bally.  In short, Bally violated  GAAP. by 

 recognizing  revenue related to the anticipated  future payments  before the reactivation 

 transactions  occurred. 

         19.    Noncek  knew   or should  have known that Bally's accounting  for reactivation  fees 

 was not in conformity  with GAAP.  Bally failed to prepare  any analysis to support the 

 reactivation  accounting  methodology. Noncek   knew  or should have known that Bally had  no 

 valid claim against the reactivation receivable  booked as ofthe balance she.etdate; and knewor 

 should  have known  that the r~ctiv:~tion9f[ersthemselves  made  no claiIn; that P~Y».1e.l1ts made

       20.     In June 2003, as Bally was in the midst ofrefmancing  its debt and was registering 

a debt offering  with the Commission,  E&Y called a meeting with Dwyer, Noncek  and other 

senior financial  officers ofBally.  The meeting  was held on June 16,2003  at Bally's  offices.  In 

the course ofthat meeting,  the E&Y audit team - which included a senior regional  partner and 

two national  office partners  - told them that E&Y would not provide a comfort  letter or consent 

that Bally needed  to complete  the debt offering  unless Bally stopped accruing  reactivation 

revenue.  Dwyer  resisted  the auditor;s  demand to stop accruing reactivations,  stating that the 

auditor  had approved Bally's accounting  for years. 

       21.     The auditors  suggested  that Bally write offthe reactivation  accrual  in that quarter 

.or over the next several quarters.  Neither  alternative  was in conformity with GAAP: the $20.3 

nlillionreactivation  accrual  could not be written offin one quarter because  a material error 

requires a restatement  under Accounting  Principles  Board Opinion No. 20, Accounting  Changes; 

and the $20.3 million  was material  to Bally's  income statement.  Similarly,  GAAP does not 

allow spreading of the write-off ofan error over several quarters. 

        22.    In response,  Dwyer asked the audit team.ifaccounting  for reactivations  on a cash 

basis was preferable.  After advising  Bally management  that the auditors  would need to consult 

with their national  office, the audit team convened in a separate room.  After a period oftime, 

E&  Y advised  Bally that the auditor  would issue a preferability  letter authorizing  Bally to change 

its accoWltit18m~tllodol()gy"... for reactivations toa cash basis, thus allowing Bally to avoid

to a cash basis ofrecognition."  As a result, Bally improperly recorded a cumulative effect 

charge for the second quarter.of 2003 of$20.3  million. 

       24.   . Noncek knew    or should have known that Bally was accounting  for reactivation 

fees in a manner that was not in conformity with GAAP and caused Bally's  financial statements 

to be materially misstated.  Noncek also knew  or should have known that the change in 

accounting  for reactivation revenue was improperly recorded as a change in accounting 

principle~ 

                               Bally  Fraudulently   Overstated  its
 
                             Gross Revenue    from  "Initiation  Fees"
 

        25.    Bally fraudulently and prematurely recognized revenue from initiation fees.  As 

described above, part of the price ofa Bally health club membership was a one-time iDitiation 

fee.  This initiation fee was either paid in full when a member joined or was financed over a 

period of time, typically 36 months.  Regardless  of whether the initiation fees were paid in full at 

the beginning of the membership,   or financed over time, GAAP prohibited Bally from 

recognizing all the revenue from initiation fees immediately. 

       26.     Instead, GAAP required that Bally recognize initiation fee revenue over the entire 

membership  life.  This means that for members who maintained their memberships beyo.nd the 

financing period, or initial period ofmembership, Bally  was required to defer initiation fee 

revenue and recognize it over the estimated membership  life, not over the term  ofthe initial 

:P¢t1Od ofmemberslllP. 
                                 .         . .                                     .
       1.7.    In 1997, Bally adopted  the "deferral method"  ofaccounting for initiation f~ 

revenue, pursuant to which Bally recognized initiation fee revenue over the estimated average 

membership  life.  The average membership life included an estimate for both the average initial 

contract period and the average renewal period.  Bally disclosed that the weighted average 

                                                 8
 
---------------------Page 9---------------------

 expected  membership  life was 22  months  for financed  memberships   and 36 months  for cash 

 memberships. 

        28.     Despite  these  disclosures, Bally's estimates ofthe weighted  average  expected 

 membership  life were flawed.  A cursory  inspection  of the computations  would  have revealed 

 these  flaws. For example, one  of the errors  involved  omitting  renewal  periods  for many 

 members   and instead  assuming  that those members  never  renewed.  Another  error was failing  to 

 estimate  a terminal  value  for renewing  members. In effect,  Bally  assumed  that all members in 

 their  renewal  periods would iinmediately cease to being  members.  The  errors in Bally's 

 estimates had the effect ofunderstating  the average  membership  life. Asa  result, Bally's. 

 member   life estimates  improperly  accelerated  revenue  recognition and distorted  the economic 

 reality ofBally's business. 

         29.    Noncek   knew  that initiation fee revenue was the largestcomponent   of Bally's 

 revenue  and that Bally's accounting  for initiation  fee revenue  was a critical  accounting  policy 

 that directly  impacted Bally's financial  statements. The results  produced by Bally's 

 demonstrably  flawed  member   life computation  were  inconsistent  with economic  reality and thus 

 unreasonable.  Noncek   knew  or should  have known   that Bally's calculations were flawed  and 

.caused  it to understate the estimated  average member  life and thus improperly  accelerate 

 recognition of initiation fee·revenue. 

         30.    Iii1997cQrntnulrications   with Commission    StaJ[fre~~gtheinu)lellientation     of 

. the deferral· method, Bally r~p:reseilted, and Noncek became aware  of this fact, that it would 

 periodically  update  those  calculations to ensure that Bally was using an appropriate  deferral 

                                                   9
 
---------------------Page 10---------------------

period.  Contrary to that commitment, in the subsequent six years, Bally failed to update the 

1997 calculations. 

        31.    Bally's  auditor formally requested Bally update its member life computations  in 

1998,2001  and 2002, but Bally never did so.  Knowing that Bally had not updated its member 

life estimate since 1997, as part of its 2003 year-end audit efforts, the audit team pressed Bally 

for support for its member life estimate.  Bally never provided the support for the member life 

estimate. 

        32.    A meeting was scheduled between the audit team and Bally financial managers 

for Sunday, January 25, 2004.  The audit team had prepared a five-item agenda for the meeting; 

four of the items related to audit adjustments totaling approximately $260 million. 

        33.    At the January 2004 meeting,E&Y  notified Bally; includirig Noncek, that it 

would have to take a charge relating to new  ac~ounting  guidance -- EITF 00-21,  Revenue 

Arrangements  With Multiple  Deliverables   ""-that Bally had failed to implement during the third 

quarter of2003.   E&Y   also identified three substantial audit adjustments that Bally would have 

to book.  E&  Y made clear that the new accounting guidance required Bally to adopt a modified 

cash basis of accounting to some  of its contracts.  As Bally and E&Y  discussed the proposed 

'change, Dwyer proposed adopting a modified cash basis    of accounting for all ofthe company's 

.membership contracts, regardless  ofwhether such contracts contained multiple deliverables. 

Noncek understood that   1he clicmgetoa  modjfi~clcash  basis ofaccounting for the rest Qfllally's·,

the charges E&  Y had identi·fied. 

        34.    Bally's  proposed change  in accounting would enable Bally to improperly avoid a 

restatement.

        35.     Noncek  prepared  a draft preferability  request  which was sent to the   E&Y 

engagement  and the concurring  partner    on February   11,2004.   The draft raised additional 

warning signals about whether Bally's  member life estimation  methodology         was  reasonable  and 

whether  Bally's  accounting  policy for initiation  fee revenue  was in confonnity  with GAAP.  For 

instance, the draft request states, "We have concluded  that    our revenue recognition  policy for 

financed membership  fees    ... does not appropriately  reflect the economic  earnings  process    of 

membership revenue  since    it accelerates  the earnings  process  ahead of membership  collections." 

The draft also states that "[f]he  earnings  pattern under the straight-line  approach  is always out  of 

sync with cash receipts.  After the average  22-month period     of recognition  is complete,  the 

earnings  process for those members paying over 36-months(i.e.  those who         do not  default) is 14 

months ahead   of cash collection;  The straight-line  method is always ahead     of cash collections, 

with approximately   30%   of the total net realizable  value ofa pool  of new  member  revenue 

remaining  to be collected  in membership  months 23 through  36." 

        36.     Noncek   knew   or should have known that these factual representations      in the draft 

preferability  request were warning signals that Bally's  accounting  for its initiation  fee revenue 

was not in conformity  with GAAP. 

        37.     E&Y   subsequently  issued   a preferability  letter allowing  Bally to change  from 

accrual accounting  to a modified  cash basis   of accounting.  As  a result of the change  in 

accounting,  BaJ:ly record¢d  a cumulative  effect change   of $44lllli.lli()n4lit$~P()3 financial

---------------------Page 12---------------------

        38.     In 2004, Bally acknowledged  that the manner in which     it applied both the deferral 

method and the modified cash method      of accOlmting for initiation fee revenue were improper and 

not in conformity with GAAP. 

        39.     At least since 2001, Noncek knew    or should have known that Bally's  accounting 

 for initiation fee revenue was not in conformity  with GAAP and caused Bally's  financial 

 statements to be materially misstated. 

                    Bally  Fraudulently   Deferred   Member    Acquisition  Costs 

        40.     At the same time it adopted a deferral policy for recognition  of initiation fee 

revenue, Bally began to defer member acquisition  costs and amortize such costs over the same 

.period that itrecognized  initiation fee revenue.	  Member acquisition  costs were supposed to be 

 the 'costs that would not have been incurred but for entering into particular member agreements. 

 Under GAAP, costs that were direct and incremental to the acquisition     of a contract were 

 permitted to be capitalized and amortized  as an expense over the same period that the deferred 

 revenue from the contract was recognized.  All other costs were required to be charged to 

 expense as incurred. 

        41.     Bally, however, arbitrarily determined  what amount    of costs to defer without any 

 reasonable empirical basis.  Among other things, Bally deferred as "membership  acquisition 

 costs" 33%  of its.Management Information  SystettlS"(MIS") department costs and 100%        of 

 various l>an}{andcreditcardcllarges   t1)rOqgh 200~~€.n·~tbeg~to        defer ~9%  of such charges).

 have known that many items deferred as  membership  acquisition  costs did not qualify for 

 deferral.  For example, "base salaries" for "sales trainees"  were improperly deferred and MIS 

                                                  12
 
---------------------Page 13---------------------

costs that were deferred  included  such non-contract-acquisition  items as depreciation, repairs  and 

maintenance, equipment  rental,  supplies,  professional  fees and utilities. 

        43.     Noncek   knew  or should  have known that Bally's  practice of deferring  member 

acquisition  costs that were not direct and incremental  to the acquisition of membership  contracts 

was not in conformity  with GAAP and therefore  misstated Bally's  financial statements. 

                                 Bally Fraudulently  Overstated  its
 
                               Gross Revenue from  tlPrepaid  Dues    tl
 

        44.     Bally also fraudulently  recognized  revenue from "prepaid dues."  Prepaid dues 

 revenue  was generated,  for example, when   a Bally health club member elected to renew his   or 

 her membership  for  an additional  period oftime after completing  the initial membership  contract 

 term.  A renewing  member  could elect to prepay his  or her renewal dues.  These prepayments 

 were referred  to as prepaid  dues. 

        45.     GAAP required  Bally to recognize  prepaid dues revenue as monthly health club 

 services  were provided.  When dues were prepaid,  the prepaid portion was to be deferred and 

 recognized  as it was earned.  From  1997 through 2003, however, Bally improperly  accelerated 

 revenue  from prepaid  dues by recognizing  as revenue each year's  prepaid dues at the time of 

 prepayment,  instead of recognizing  it over the period for which that member had prepaid. 

        46.     Beginning   in at least 2001, Noncek knew that Bally was improperly  accelerating 

. revenue  from prepaid dues; but he failed  to assess the scope ofthe problem, take corrective 

                               ..":. 

 periods. In its 2003 Form   lO;.;K, Bally restated its prepaid dues revenue for prior periods going 

 back to 1997 because,  as the Company  reported, its  previous  methodology  resulted in "errors in 

 calculating  prepaid  dues and accelerated dues  recognition  for certain prepaying  members." 

                                                  13
 
---------------------Page 14---------------------

        48.     Noncek knew   or should have known that Bally was accounting  for prepaid dues 

 revenue in a manner that was not in conformity with GAAP and caused Bally's  financial 

 statements to be materially misstated. 

                            Bally's False and  Misleading  Disclosure
 
                 Relating  to a $55 Million Special Charge   in Fiscal Year 2002
 

        49.     In 2002, Bally made a false and misleading disclosure in its SEC filings about the 

 reasons for a specific recorded adjustment.  Noncek was, with others, responsible  for Bally's 

 filings and knew or should have known that Bally made the false and misleading disclosure. 

        50.     From 1997 through 2002, Bally consistently used a  41 % reserve rate in 

,establishing its allowance for doubtful accounts ("ADA"),  despite changes in the economy and  in 

 market conditions.  The result ofusing the unvarying 41 % rate was that Bally's  ADA was at the 

 low end of the range that E& Y had deemed to be reasonable. 

        51.     During the third quarter of2002, E&Y determined that Bally's  collections had 

 deteriorated substantially  and advised Dwyer and Noncek that Bally needed to increase its ADA 

 in order to cover the shortfall resulting from the deteriorating collections.  Dwyer insisted that no 

 change be made to the  ADA   until the fourth quarter to allow Bally time to obtain waivers ofdebt 

 covenants provisions  from its lenders. 

        52.     Noncek also knew that Dwyer also did not want to disclose that the reason for
 

 taking a charge was due to deteriorating collections. In a letter to Bally's  lenders, Noncek was
 

.a'W~e~tpWyerrepr~entedthat~'tl1e"onetime        c.ge    does not reflect anydeterio~Onm\the 

"COlnpa,rty's expecte<lcash flows." 

        53.     During the fourth quaiter of2002, Dwyer agreed to increase Bally's ADA by    $55" 

 million, and Bally ultimately presented it as a "special charge"in its year-end financial 

 statements.  In its 2002 Form 10-K,Bally  made false and misleading disclosures regarding the 

                                                14
 
---------------------Page 15---------------------

reasons for the charge: the only reason for the charge cited in the Form lO-K was that Bally's 

estimation was based on an accelerated monetization scenario which would result in collecting 

less than book value. No mention was made   ofthe deterioration ofthe collectability ofBally's 

accounts receivable portfolio, which had been identified by the auditor as requiring Bally to take 

a charge. 

       54.    Noncek knew or should have known that Bally's  disclosure relating to the $55 

million charge was materially false and misleading.  The $55 million special charge virtually 

eliminated Bally's  2002 earnings. 

               Internal  Control Failures  And False and Misleading Records 

       55.    At least for the periods 2001 through 2003, Bally had a system of internal controls· 

that was not sufficient to detect violations ofGAAP. Noncek, as Bally's  Controller, had 

responsibility for overseeing Bally's  internal controls.  Based on the foregoing conduct, Noncek 

knew or should have known that internal controls were not sufficient to detect violations of 

GAAP. 

       56.    As Bally's  Controller, Noncek also had responsibility for overseeing Bally's 

books and records.  Based on the foregoing conduct, Noncek knew   or should have known that 

Bally's  books and records were false and misleading.
