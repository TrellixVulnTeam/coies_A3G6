THE DISTRIBUTION PLAN
The Distribution Plan provides for distribution of the disgorgement, prejudgment interest and penalties paid by Grant Thornton LLP ("Grant Thornton") and Doeren Mayhew & Co. P.C. ("Doeren Mayhew") in this matter (the "Distribution Fund") to the holders ("claimants") as of January 22, 1999 of MCA's 11% subordinated debentures, Series 1997, due June 1, 2003 ("Series 1997 debentures").
The Distribution Fund consists of the $59,749.41 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and $1.5 million in penalties paid by Grant Thornton in this matter and the $115,126.86 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest paid by Doeren Mayhew in this matter.
Each claimant shall receive a pro rata share of the Distribution Fund after payment of a plan administrator's reasonable fees and reimbursement of a plan administrator's reasonable costs and expenses.
Claimants shall be those individuals and entities who invested in MCA's 11% subordinated debentures, Series 1997, due June 1, 2003, or their lawful successors, except for individuals who were employed by MCA.
A claimant's pro rata share will be computed by calculating the amount invested by the claimant in MCA's 11% subordinated debentures, Series 1997, due June 1, 2003 as a percentage of the total amount invested in MCA's 11% subordinated debentures, Series 1997, due June 1, 2003.
