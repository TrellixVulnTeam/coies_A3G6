In the Matter of                                          ORDER DENYING MOTION 
                                                          TO LIFT TEMPORARY SUSPENSION 
        RAJNISH K. DAS                                    AND DIRECT HEARING 
         

 
 
        On October 24, 2012, we issued an order instituting proceedings against Rajnish K. Das 
                                                         1
pursuant to Commission Rule of Practice 102(e)(3)         that temporarily suspended him from 
                                                     2
appearing or practicing before    the Commission    .  

        The OIP alleges that   Das was   the chief financial officer  of infoUSA, Inc. from 
approximately September 2003 through January 2006,           and in that position  certified infoUSA   ’s 
                                                       3
Forms 10-K that were filed with the Commission.          On  March   15 , 2010,   the Commission   filed a 
                                                           
1
        Rule of Practice 102(e)(3)(i), 17 C.F.R. § 201.102(e)(3)(i), provides: 
 
        The Commission, with due regard to the public interest and without preliminary hearing, may, by order, 
        temporarily suspend from appearing or practicing before it any attorney, accountant, engineer, or other 
        professional or expert who has been by name: 
         
                (A)  Permanently enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction, by reason of his or her 
                misconduct in an action brought by the Commission, from violating or aiding and abetting the 
                violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or of the rules and regulations thereunder; 
                or 
                 
                (B)  Found by any court of competent jurisdiction in an action brought by the Commission to 
                which he or she is a party or found by the Commission in any administrative proceeding to which 
                he or she is a party to have violated (unless the violation was found not to have been willful) or 
                aided and abetted the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or of the rules and 
                regulations thereunder.

        Id. at *1. The OIP also alleges that Das “has not passed the certified public accountant (‘CPA’) exam and 
has not been a licensed CPA.”  Id. at *1.

complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska alleging that Das 

engaged in securities fraud and other violations of the securities laws by preparing and reviewing 

infoUSA’s Forms 10-K and proxy statements that materially understated and failed to properly 

disclose perquisite compensation to Vinod Gupta, infoUSA’s former chief executive officer and 

Chairman of the Board of Directors, and failed to properly disclose related party transactions 
                    4
involving Gupta.      The complaint also alleged that Das aide         d and abetted the filing of     info USA   ’s 

false Forms 10-K. 

         A jury found that Das violated the antifraud, false proxy statements, false certifications, 

false statements and omissions to accountants and auditors, and books-and-records provisions of 

the federal securities laws. It also found that Das aided and abetted infoUSA’s violations of the 
                                                                                                 5
reporting and record-keeping provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.                    On  May 29, 

2012 , the  district court entered a judgment permanently enjoining            Das  from   future violations   , 

direct  ly  or indirectly ,  of §§  10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), 13(b)(5), and 14(a)         of the 

Exchange Act, and      Rules 10b   -5, 12b  -20, 13a  -1, 13a  -13, 13a  -14, 13b2  -1, 13b2  -2, 14a  -3, and    
                                     6
14a -9  promulgated    thereunder.     The judgment also barred Das from serving as a di            rector or 

officer of a publicly   traded company for a period of three years, an          d ordered Das to pay a civil 
                                   7
monetary penalty of $50,000.         

         In issuing the OIP, we found it      “appropriate and in the public interest” that Das be 

temporarily suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission based on the district 

court’s final judgment. We stated that the temporary suspension would become permanent unless 

Das filed a petition challenging it within thirty days of service of the order, pursuant to Rule of 

Practice 102(e)(3)(ii). We further advised that, pursuant to Rule of Practice 102(e)(3)(iii), upon 

receipt of such a petition, we would either lift the temporary suspension, set the matter down for 

hearing, or both. 

         In his petition, Das requests that the temporary suspension be lifted, arguing that (i) he is 

outside the reach of the suspension provision of Rule of Practice 102(e)(3)(i) because he has 

never been an accountant or “other professional,” (ii) the OIP was filed more than ninety days 

after the final judgment and was therefore untimely under Rule 102(e)(3), (iii) the doctrine of 

collateral estoppel prevents the Commission from imposing a permanent suspension based on

         The jury found that Das violated (i) the antifraud provisions in Exchange Act § 10(b), 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b), 
and Rule 10b -5 thereunder, 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b  -5; (ii)  the  false proxy statements provisions of Exchange Act 
§  14(a), 15 U.S.C. § 78n(a), and Rules 14a-3 and 14a-9 thereunder, 17 C.F.R. §§  240.14a  -3 and 14a-9; (iii)   the false 
certifications provisions of Exchange Act Rule 13a -14, 17 C.F.R. § 240.13a  -14; ( iv) the false statements and 
omissions to accountants and auditors provisions of Exchange Act Rule 13b2   -2, 17 C.F.R. § 240.13b2 -2 ; and (v) the 
books  -and -records provisions of Exchange Act § 13(b)(5), 15 U.S.C. § 78m(b)(5), and Rule 13b2  -1 thereunder, 17 
C.F.R. §   240.13b2-1 . The jury further found that Das aided and abetted infoUSA’s violations of (i) the issuer 
reporting requirements in Exchange Act § 13(a), 15 U.S.C. § 78m(a), and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-
13 thereunder, 17 C.F.R. §§ 240.12b-20, 240.13a-1 and 240.13a-13; and (ii) the books-and-records provisions of 
Exchange Act § 13(b)(2), 15 U.S.C. § 78m(b)(2).

findings made by the district court, and (iv) the suspension is not in the public interest. The 
Division of Enforcement has not filed an opposition to Das’s petition. 

         Rule 102(e)(3)(i)(a) permits the Commission to suspend any accountant or other 
professional or expert who has been “[p]ermanently enjoined . . . from violating or aiding and 
abetting the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or of the rules and 
                             8
regulations thereunder.”  At this stage it appears that the findings made in the injunctive 
proceeding and the injunction issued against Das “justify the continuance of his suspension until 
it can be determined what, if any, action may be appropriate to protect the Commission’s 
             9                                           10
processes.”  As provided in Rule 102(e)(3)(iii),            therefore, we will set the matter down for 
public hearing.    

         Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that this proceeding be set                 down for public hearing before 
an administrative law judge in accordance with Rule of Practice 110. As specified in Rule of 
Practice 102(e)(3)(iii), the hearing in this matter shall be expedited in accordance with Rule of 
Practice 500; it is further    

         ORDERE      D that the administrative law judge shall issue an initial decision no later than 
210 days from the date of service of this order; and it is further           

         ORDERED that the temporary suspension of Rajnish K. Das, entered on October 24, 
2012, remain in effect     pending a hearing and decision in this matter.
