                                            I. 

              The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) deems it appropriate and in the 
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against Rex R. 
Rogers (Respondent or Rogers) pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(i) of the Commissions Rules of 
Practice.1

             Rule 102(e)(3)(i) provides, in relevant part, that: 
 
              The Commission, with due regard to the public interest and without preliminary hearing, 
may, by order, . . . suspend from appearing or practicing before it any . . . attorney . . . who has 
been by name . . . [p]ermanently enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction, by reason of 
his or her misconduct in an action brought by the Commission, from violating or aiding and 
abetting the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or of the rules and 
regulations thereunder.

                                               II. 

       In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (Offer) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the purpose of 
these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the Commission, or to 
which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings herein, except as 
to the Commissions jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these proceedings, and the 
findings contained in Section III(3) below, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of 
this Order Instituting Public Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the 
Commissions Rules of Practice, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (Order), as 
set forth below. 

                                              III. 

              On the basis of this Order and Respondents Offer, the Commission finds that: 

       1. Respondent Rogers,      59, is and has been an attorney licensed to practice in the State 
of Texas.  Rogers, a former enforcement attorney for the Commission from 1979 through 1984, was 
hired in 1985 by Houston Natural Gas, the predecessor of Enron Corp. (Enron).  In 1997, Rogers 
was promoted to Vice President and Associate General Counsel of Enron with shared responsibility 
for the timing and content of Commission filings.  Rogers remained in that position until 2003, 
following Enrons bankruptcy, and has not been employed since 2003.  

       2.           Enron was, at all relevant times, an Oregon corporation with its principal place of 
business in Houston, Texas.  Until its bankruptcy filing in December 2001, Enron was the seventh 
largest corporation in the United States based upon reported revenue.  In the previous ten years, 
Enron had evolved from a regional natural gas provider to a commodity trader of natural gas, 
electricity, and other physical commodities with retail operations in energy and other products.  
Enron also created and traded financial products.  At all relevant times, the common stock of Enron 
was registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 (Exchange Act) and traded on the New York Stock Exchange. 

       3.           On January 20, 2009, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, 
Houston Division, entered a final judgment by consent against Rogers, permanently enjoining him 
from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 14(a) of the 
Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 14a-9, and aiding and abetting violations of 
Sections 13(a) and 16(a) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 
16a-2 and 16a-3.  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Jordan H. Mintz, et al., Civil Action 
Number H-07-1027 (S.D. Tex.).  Rogers was also ordered to pay $1 in disgorgement and a 
$25,000 civil money penalty. 

       4.           Among other things, the Commissions complaint alleges that Rogers and co-
defendant Jordan H. Mintz, the former General Counsel for Enron Global  Finance, intentionally 
failed to disclose in Enrons 2000 proxy statement millions of dollars paid to the former Chief 
Financial Officer, Andrew Fastow.  The complaint further alleges that Rogers failed to disclose 
$16 million realized through insider stock sales by Enrons former Chairman, Kenneth Lay, in 

                                               2 
---------------------Page 3---------------------

Enrons 2000 Proxy Statement, and aided and abetted Lays failure to disclose an additional $70 
million in stock sales in Lays Form 4 filings with the Commission. 

          

                                                         IV. 

         In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
impose the sanction agreed to in Respondents Offer. 

         Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, effective immediately, that Rogers is suspended 
from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an attorney for two years.  Before 
appearing and resuming practice before the Commission as an attorney, Rogers must submit an 
affidavit to the Commissions Office of the General Counsel truthfully stating, under penalty of 
perjury, that he has complied with this Order, that he is not subject to any suspension or disbarment 
as an attorney by a court of the United States or of any state, territory, district, commonwealth, or 
possession, and that he has not been convicted of a felony or misdemeanor involving moral 
turpitude as set forth in Rule 102(e)(2) of the Commissions Rules of Practice. 

  
 By the Commission.
