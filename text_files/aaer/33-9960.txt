                                                III. 

                                                                                     1
       On the basis of this Order and the Offer of Respondent, the Commission finds    that:  

       A.      RESPONDENT       

       1.      David G.  Derrick, Sr. (“Derrick”) served as Chairman of the Board and Chief 
Executive Officer (“CEO”) of SecureAlert, Inc. (now known as Track Group) from February 2001 
until June 30, 2011.  Derrick, 62 years old, is a resident of Farmington, Utah. 
        
       B.      OTHER RELEVANT ENTITY AND INDIVIDUAL 

       2.      SecureAlert, Inc., now known as Track Group and formerly known as RemoteMDx, 
Inc. (“SecureAlert”), incorporated in Utah in 1995, markets and sells tracking technology devices in 
the area of adult probation and parole.  SecureAlert’s principal place of business is in Sandy, Utah.  
SecureAlert’s common stock is registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the 
Exchange Act and trades on the OTC Bulletin Board.  SecureAlert files periodic reports, including 
Forms 10-K and 10-Q, with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and 
related rules thereunder. 
 
       3.      James J. Dalton, Jr. (“Dalton”) served as a Director of SecureAlert from 2001 to 
November 2, 2009 and was President from August 2003 to June 19, 2008.  Dalton, 72 years old, is a 
resident of Park City, Utah. 

       C.      BACKGROUND 

 
       4.      In 2007, SecureAlert sold its product through a distributorship system, whereby 
distributors were given specific territories in which to market SecureAlert product.  SecureAlert had 
been struggling for years and was making a substantial effort to boost sales and revenues. 
 
                     Undisclosed Personal Guarantees by Derrick and Dalton 
 
       5.      On September 20, 2007, just prior to the end of the fiscal year on September 30, 
2007, SecureAlert entered into an Exclusive Distribution Agreement (“Distribution Agreement”) 
with a large investor (“Distributor”).  The Distribution Agreement called for Distributor to purchase 
2,000 devices at $500 each for a total of $1 million, with payment due in six months. 
    
       6.      Derrick negotiated the Distribution Agreement on behalf of SecureAlert.  Prior to 
executing the agreement, Distributor informed Derrick and Dalton that he would not pay for any 
product and would not subject himself to liability for purchasing product if he was unable to sell it.  
Dalton does not recall that either Derrick or Distributor told him whether Distributor had sold any 
SecureAlert product to end user customers but Distributor told Derrick or Dalton that Distibutor 
was engaging in significant efforts to leverage his business and personal connections to, among 
other things, establish a sales infrastructure to sell SecureAlert product.  Derrick, Dalton and 

                                                 
1
 The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent’s Offer of Settlement and are not binding 
on any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding. 

                                                 2 
---------------------Page 3---------------------

 

Distributor knew this was a new technology application and that the possibility of product failure 
existed.  
    
       7.      Distributor further informed Derrick that he did not need any product at the time 
because he did not yet have customers.  Derrick insisted that Distributor accept shipment of the 
2,000 units from SecureAlert, and Derrick and Dalton agreed that Distributor would not have to 
pay for product that Distributor was not able to sell.  To document this, the Distribution Agreement 
gave Distributor a right of return and reimbursement for any unused units in the event the contract 
was terminated for any reason. 
        
       8.      To further protect himself from liability, Distributor also required Derrick and 
Dalton to personally guarantee that they would pay for any unused units under the Distribution 
Agreement if Distributor was not satisfied with the devices or the business arrangement for any 
reason.  Derrick and Dalton signed a letter dated September 20, 2007 to that effect.  Derrick and 
Dalton did not disclose the personal guarantee to other Board members or employees of 
SecureAlert, nor did they disclose it to SecureAlert’s independent auditor or outside securities 
counsel.  Distributor accepted the 2,000 units but did not pay for any product at the time. 
        
       9.      On December 13, 2007, near the end of the following quarter, Derrick and Dalton 
requested a purchase order from Distributor to purchase an additional 2,000 devices from 
SecureAlert at $500 each for a total of $1 million, with payment due in six months.  Dalton does 
not recall Derrick or Distributor at the time of the second purchase order, telling Dalton that 
Distributor had not yet sold any of the first 2,000 units or any additional devices that would be 
requested by a purchase order.  Distributor informed Derrick he did not need any more devices, but 
Derrick insisted on the purchase order and that Distributor accept shipment of the devices.  Derrick 
and Dalton again agreed to provide a personal guarantee that they would pay for any unused units.  
Derrick and Dalton did not disclose this agreement to other Board members or employees of 
SecureAlert, nor did they disclose it to SecureAlert’s independent auditor or outside securities 
counsel.  Distributor accepted the second 2,000 units but did not pay for any product at the time. 
 
       10.     Derrick and Dalton knew or were reckless in not knowing that the personal 
guarantees were material related-party agreements that should have been disclosed and should 
have been considered in SecureAlert’s financial statements. 
        
       11.     SecureAlert filed its Form 10-KSB for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007 
(“2007 Form 10-KSB”) on January 15, 2008.  The financial statements reported $1 million in 
revenue for the September 20, 2007 transaction with Distributor.  The $1 million was also recorded 
as an accounts receivable due in six months, on or around March 20, 2007.  Derrick signed 
certifications for the 2007 Form 10-KSB as CEO.  The 2007 Form 10-KSB did not disclose the 
personal guarantee and did not consider the personal guarantee in its accounting treatment of the 
$1 million purported sale in September 2007. 
 
       12.     The $1 million in reported revenue for the September 2007 transaction represented 
29% of product revenues and 12% of total revenues for fiscal year 2007 and represented a gross 
profit of $254,000.  SecureAlert reported a gross loss of $404,000 for the year.  Without gross 

                                                 3 
---------------------Page 4---------------------

 

profits from the $1 million “sale” to Distributor at year-end, the gross loss would have been 63% 
greater. 
        
       13.     SecureAlert filed its Form 10-QSB for the period ended December 31, 2007 
(“December 31, 2007 Form 10-QSB”) on February 14, 2008.  The December 31, 2007 Form 10-
QSB reported $1 million in revenue for the December 2007 transaction with Distributor.  The $1 
million was also recorded as an accounts receivable due in six months, on or around June 13, 2008.  
Derrick signed certifications for the December 31, 2007 Form 10-QSB.  The December 31, 2007 
Form 10-QSB did not disclose the personal guarantee that Distributor would not be liable for 
unsold product and did not consider this  personal guarantee in its accounting treatment of the $1 
million purported sale in December 2007. 
 
       14.    On March 13, 2008, staff in the Commission’s Division of Corporation Finance 
(“Corp Fin Staff”) issued a comment letter (“March 13 Comment Letter”) with regard to 
SecureAlert’s 2007 Form 10-KSB and its December 31, 2007 Form 10-QSB.  The March 13 
Comment Letter included a question as to why the year-end accounts receivable balance was more 
than half of SecureAlert’s revenue for the year. 
 
             Undisclosed Personal Financing of Transactions by Derrick and Dalton 
                                                  
       15.    Soon after receiving Corp Fin Staff’s comment letter, payment for the first $1 
million purported sale to Distributor became due, on or around March 20, 2008.  In the meantime, 
Distributor had learned that many of the devices shipped to him were defective or damaged.  
Distributor had not sold any devices at that point, and he refused to pay for defective devices or 
devices he had not sold.  Derrick attempted to arrange financing to pay the accounts receivable 
due, in an apparent attempt to conceal the fact that revenue should not have been recognized in the 
transaction.  In this way, SecureAlert’s accounting records would reflect the $1 million accounts 
receivable as fully paid at or around the due date. 
        
       16.    Derrick reached out to a third party financing entity (“Third Party”), with which he 
had previously done business.  Third Party agreed to make the payment for the accounts receivable 
to SecureAlert.  However, Third Party would not provide funding because of the risk, so Derrick 
and Dalton provided their own personal funds, through their entity, to finance the transaction.   
 
       17.     The Third Party transaction was documented with a promissory note dated March 
26, 2008, in which Distributor promised to pay Third Party $1 million plus interest by March 31, 
2009.  Distributor signed the promissory note, but Derrick and Distributor agreed that the 
transaction was executed on paper only and that Distributor had no obligation to pay $1 million to 
Third Party.  Derrick and Distributor also agreed that Distributor would not be liable for any 
interest due under the note.  Dalton was made aware of the agreement between Derrick and 
Distributor.  Derrick and Dalton did not disclose to Distributor that they provided the $1 million in 
funds to Third Party. 
 
       18.     Derrick and Dalton sent $1 million of their personal funds to Third Party on March 
31, 2008.  Third Party, in turn, sent the funds to SecureAlert to satisfy the $1 million accounts 
receivable due in March 2008. 

                                                4 
---------------------Page 5---------------------

 

 
       19.     The accounts receivable for the December 2007 $1 million purported sale to 
Distributor became due on or around June 13, 2008.  Again, Distributor had not yet sold any 
devices, so he refused to pay for devices that were defective or unsold.  Derrick again approached 
Third Party, which agreed to make the second payment for the accounts receivable to SecureAlert 
if Derrick and Dalton again provided the funds. 
 
       20.     The second Third Party transaction was documented with a promissory note dated 
September 16, 2008, in which Distributor promised to pay Third Party $1 million plus interest by 
September 16, 2009.  Distributor signed the promissory note, but again Derrick and Distributor 
agreed that this transaction was executed on paper only and that Distributor had no obligation to 
pay the $1 million to Third Party.  Derrick and Distributor also agreed that Distributor would not 
be liable for any interest due under the note.  Dalton was made aware of the agreements.  Derrick 
and Dalton did not disclose to Distributor that they provided the second $1 million in funds to 
Third Party. 
 
       21.     Derrick and Dalton sent $1 million of their personal funds to Third Party on 
September 12, 2008.  This time, Third Party wired the money to Distributor, who in turn forwarded 
$1 million to SecureAlert on September 25, 2008, just prior to the end of fiscal year 2008.  The $1 
million was used to pay the $1 million accounts receivable due in June 2008. 
 
       22.     Derrick and Dalton did not disclose their personal financing of the Third Party 
transactions to other Board members or employees of SecureAlert, nor did they disclose it to 
SecureAlert’s independent auditor or outside securities counsel. 
 
                              Comment Process with Corp Fin Staff 
 
       23.     From March to June 2008, SecureAlert engaged in the comment process with Corp 
Fin Staff.  On April 28, 2008, SecureAlert filed a response to the staff’s March 13, 2008 comment 
letter, and discussed SecureAlert’s revenue recognition policies.  The letter was signed by Derrick 
and represented that SecureAlert only recognized revenue if the following conditions were met:  
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, title passes to the customer and the customer 
cannot return the devices, prices are fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.   
 
       24.     SecureAlert also made the following separate representations about revenue 
recognition in its April 28, 2008 response:  (1) “Distributors do not have general rights of return;” 
(2) “Generally, title and risk of loss pass to the buyer upon delivery of the devices;” (3) “The 
distributors do not have general rights of return for these devices.”   
 
       25.     The statements related to revenue recognition were false in the case of Distributor 
because Derrick and Dalton had made assurances to Distributor that he would not be liable for any 
unsold devices and that Distributor could return devices at any time for any reason. 
 
       26.     In the April 28, 2008 response and a response to additional staff comments filed on 
May 14, 2008, SecureAlert represented that it had collected 100% of the accounts receivable due 
from Distributor for the first $1 million purported sale.  The responses did not disclose that 

                                                 5 
---------------------Page 6---------------------

 

Distributor did not pay the receivable.  The responses did not disclose that Derrick and Dalton 
actually paid the receivable with their own personal funds through a third party.  The responses did 
not disclose that Derrick and Dalton had agreements with Distributor that he was not liable to pay 
for any devices he did not sell. 
 
       27.      During the comment process, SecureAlert reviewed the Distribution Agreement.  
SecureAlert, in consultation with its independent auditor and outside securities counsel, determined 
that the provision in the Distribution Agreement allowing Distributor a right to return product did 
not allow for revenue to be recognized.  Therefore, SecureAlert informed Corp Fin Staff that it 
would restate the $1 million initially recorded as revenue from the purported sale in September 
2007 to “deferred revenue.”   
 
       28.     On May 6, 2008, SecureAlert filed a Form 8-K announcing a restatement of the 
financial statements, including the deferral of the $1 million in revenue from the September 2007 
contract with Gonzalez.  The Form 8-K contained no disclosure of the personal guarantees or the 
personal financing of the $1 million “sale.”  
 
       29.     To avoid future issues with revenue recognition, SecureAlert amended the 
Distribution Agreement in April 2008 (“Amended Distribution Agreement”) to remove 
Distributor’s unilateral right to return product.  SecureAlert determined that under the Amended 
Distribution Agreement, revenue from sales to Distributor could be recognized immediately if they 
met the required revenue recognition conditions, including that title passes to the customer and the 
customer cannot return devices.  Based on this determination, SecureAlert concluded it did not 
need to restate revenue from the December 2007 purported sale to Distributor.  Derrick and Dalton 
did not disclose their side agreement that Distributor could return unused or unsold product for any 
reason and that Distributor would not be liable for any product it did not use. 
 
          SecureAlert Files Materially Misstated Periodic Reports with the Commission 
 
       30.     On June 18, 2008, SecureAlert filed an amended Form 10-QSB/A for the period 
ended December 31, 2007 (“December 2007 Form 10-QSB/A”).  The $1 million in revenue for the 
second purported sale to Distributor in December 2007 was not restated and remained in the 
financials as revenue.  Derrick signed certifications as CEO for the December 2007 Form 10-
QSB/A. 
 
       31.     On June 19, 2008, SecureAlert filed an amended Form 10-KSB/A (“2007 Form 10-
KSB/A”).  The 2007 Form 10-KSB/A restated the $1 million revenue from the first purported sale 
in September 2007 as “deferred revenue.”  The Distribution Agreement was attached as an exhibit 
to the filing; however, the personal guarantee and the personal financing arrangements were not 
disclosed.  Derrick signed certifications as CEO for the 2007 Forms 10-KSB/A and 10-QSB/A. 

       32.     On August 15, 2008, SecureAlert filed its Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 
2008 (“June 2008 Form 10-Q”).  Because of the Amended Distribution Agreement, SecureAlert 
determined it could now recognize revenue from the September 2007 $1 million purported sale to 
Distributor.  Derrick signed certifications as CEO for the June 2008 Form 10-Q. 

                                                6 
---------------------Page 7---------------------

 

       33.     On December 26, 2008, SecureAlert filed its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended 
September 30, 2008 (“2008 Form 10-K).  The entire $2 million for the September and December 
2007 purported sales was reported as revenue in the year-end financial statements.  The $2 million 
in reported revenue made up 78% of SecureAlert’s product revenues and 16% of all revenues for 
fiscal year 2008.  Derrick signed certifications as CEO for the 2008 Form 10-K. 

       34.     The materially misstated financial statements continued to be reported in 
SecureAlert’s filings through the end of fiscal year 2009.  The filings included Forms 10-Q for the 
periods ended December 31, 2008, March 31, 2009, and June 30, 2009.  The Form 10-K for the 
fiscal year ended September 30, 2009 (“2009 Form 10-K”) was the last report to contain the 
misstated financial statements and was filed on January 13, 2010.  Derrick signed certifications as 
CEO for each of the quarterly reports filed during fiscal year 2009 and the 2009 Form 10-K. 

       35.    Derrick made misrepresentations to SecureAlert’s independent auditor during the 
yearly audit and quarterly review periods for each of the relevant periods.  For each period, he 
signed a management representation letter to the auditor, representing, among other things, that:  
financial statements were fairly presented in conformity with GAAP along with all related 
disclosures, that he had no knowledge of any fraud or suspected fraud, and that all related party 
transactions had been properly recorded or disclosed.  These representations were false in light of 
the undisclosed personal guarantees and personal related-party financing of transactions. 
                                                  
            Assignment of Third Party Promissory Notes to Derrick and Dalton Entity 
 
       36.     By June 2009, SecureAlert and its distributors continued to struggle.  There were 
still problems with technology and defective units and Distributor had sold little, if any, of the $2 
million in product purportedly sold to him in September and December 2007.  The $2 million 
owed to Third Party had not been paid.  The first $1 million was three months overdue, and 
Derrick knew that Distributor would not pay.  Although Third Party had not provided any funds for 
the transactions, Third Party desired to remove the large, stale accounts receivables from Third 
Party’s balance sheet.  Therefore, Derrick devised a plan to arrange additional transactions, which 
served to cover up the personal financing arrangements and the personal guarantees. 
 
       37.    In June 2009, Derrick formed an entity called JBD Management, LLC (“JBD”).  
JBD was owned by Derrick (47.5%), Dalton (47.5%) and Third Party (5%).  Derrick arranged for 
Third Party to assign its interest in the March 2008 $1 million promissory note and the September 
2008 $1 million promissory note to JBD.  The assignment involved a series of transactions and 
documents executed in July 2009.  Interest due on the notes had previously been paid to Third 
Party by Derrick and Dalton.   

       38.     The end result was that, on paper, Distributor appeared to owe $2 million to JBD.  
Derrick and Dalton did not disclose that Distributor was not obligated to pay the $2 million to JBD, 
nor did they disclose that funds for the Third Party transactions had been personally provided by 
Derrick and Dalton. 

       39.     In addition, Derrick and Dalton executed and signed a second undisclosed side 
agreement, dated July 13, 2009, to personally guarantee the re-purchase of any unused product in 
Distributor’s possession by December 31, 2010.  This personal guarantee apparently documented 

                                                7 
---------------------Page 8---------------------

 

the agreement that Distributor would not be liable for the 2,000 units purportedly sold to him in 
December 2007, and he would not have to make payments on the financing arrangement, which 
were to come due in September 2009, if Distributor did not need or sell devices.  Derrick and 
Dalton did not disclose this personal guarantee to other Board members or employees of 
SecureAlert, nor did they disclose it to SecureAlert’s independent auditor or outside securities 
counsel. 

       40.     During the relevant period, Derrick and Dalton solicited investments in SecureAlert 
and obtained money or property, including money for the sale of SecureAlert stock, by means of 
the material misstatements and omissions contained in the company’s financial statements and the 
non-disclosure of their personal guarantees and material related-party transactions.  During that 
time period, SecureAlert was engaged in offering and selling its securities in private offerings and 
via Forms S-8.  SecureAlert issued 23,927,219 shares of common stock to a number of private 
parties for prices ranging from $0.20 to $1.00 and a total of $8,307,914.00.  In addition, on August 
26, 2008 and March 9, 2009, SecureAlert filed Forms S-8 to register shares for sales or awards of 
stock to employees.  The August 26, 2008 Form S-8 incorporated by reference SecureAlert’s 
materially false financial statements found in SecureAlert’s 2007 Form 10-KSB.  The March 9, 
2009 Form S-8 incorporated by reference SecureAlert’s materially false financial statements found 
in SecureAlert’s 2008 Form 10-K.  Derrick’s and Dalton’s actions also constituted a transaction, 
practice, or course of business which operated as a fraud or deceit in the offer or sale of 
SecureAlert securities. 

                                   Internal Control Deficiencies 

       41.     During the relevant period, Derrick and Dalton knowingly failed to implement a 
system of internal accounting controls for SecureAlert and directly or indirectly caused to be 
falsified SecureAlert’s books, records, and accounts. 

       42.       Through their conduct, Derrick and Dalton caused SecureAlert’s books and 
records to be inaccurate and caused SecureAlert to fail to devise or maintain a system of sufficient 
internal accounting controls. 

              Discovery of Undisclosed Personal Guarantees and Personal Financing 

       43.     In or around spring of 2011, Distributor and Derrick discussed the issue of 
obligation under the Third Party transactions.  For the first time, Derrick admitted to Distributor 
that he and Dalton had provided the financing for the Third Party transactions.  Over the next 
several months, Distributor had discussions with the Board regarding the situation.  The Board 
ultimately asked for Derrick’s resignation, which he provided on June 30, 2011. 

       44.     After Derrick left SecureAlert, the Board authorized an internal investigation into 
Derrick’s business dealings, including transactions with Distributor and Third Party.  SecureAlert 
and Derrick jointly self-reported the possible violations.  Later, the results of the internal 
investigation were provided to Commission Enforcement Staff.  After initiation of the internal 
investigation, SecureAlert implemented a number of internal control procedures to prevent future 
violations of the federal securities laws.

                                   Reclassification of Revenues 

       45.     After learning of the personal guarantees and personal financing arrangements by 
Derrick and Dalton, SecureAlert, with the help of its independent auditor, concluded it should 
reclassify the $2 million for the Distributor transactions as capital contributions.  SecureAlert 
determined that the transactions should be treated as capital contributions because JBD was 
ultimately issued stock for the $2 million that Derrick and Dalton paid to finance the transactions.  
This was pursuant to the assignment of the Third Party notes to JBD and subsequent transactions 
involving SecureAlert and Distributor. 

       46.     The reclassification was made in the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 and reported 
in SecureAlert’s Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2012, which was filed on May 17, 
2012.  For that period, SecureAlert’s 2008 statement of operations was no longer presented in its 
filings.  As a result, the reclassification was made directly between SecureAlert’s accumulated 
deficit and additional paid-in capital.  At the time, SecureAlert’s balance sheet reflected $249 
million in additional paid-in capital and an accumulated deficit of $234 million. 

       47.     As a result of the conduct described above, Derrick violated Section 17(a) of the 
Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, which prohibit 
fraudulent conduct in the offer and sale of securities and in connection with the purchase or sale of 
securities. 

       48.     As a result of the conduct described above, Derrick violated Exchange Act Rule 
13a-14, which requires the principal executive officer to sign and certify annual and quarterly 
reports. 

       49.     As a result of the conduct described above, Derrick violated Section 13(b)(5) of the 
Exchange Act, which prohibits any person from knowingly circumventing or failing to implement 
a system of internal accounting controls and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, which prohibits the direct or 
indirect falsification of an issuer’s books, records, or accounts. 

       50.     As a result of the conduct described above, Derrick violated Exchange Act Rule 
13b2-2, which prohibits directors or officers of an issuer to make or cause to made materially false 
or misleading statements or omissions to an accountant in connection with any audit, review, or 
examination of the financial statements of the issuer. 

       51.     As a result of the conduct described above, Derrick caused violations of Section 
13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder, which require the 
filing of annual and quarterly reports that do not contain material misstatements or omissions. 

       52.     As a result of the conduct described above, Derrick caused violations of Section 
13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act, which requires Section 12 registrants to make and keep books, 
records, and accounts, which in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and 
dispositions of the assets of the issuer and  Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, which 
requires Section 12 registrants to devise and maintain a system of sufficient internal accounting 
controls.

Martinez, Regional Director, Salt Lake Regional Office, Securities and Exchange Commission, 
351 South West Temple, Suite 6.100, Salt Lake City, Utah 84101.  
        
       Amounts ordered to be paid as civil money penalties pursuant to this Order shall be 
treated as penalties paid to the government for all purposes, including all tax purposes.  To 
preserve the deterrent effect of the civil penalty, Respondent agrees that in any Related Investor 
Action, he shall not argue that he is entitled to, nor shall he benefit by, offset or reduction of 
any award of compensatory damages by the amount of any part of Respondent’s payment of a 
civil penalty in this action ("Penalty Offset").  If the court in any Related Investor Action grants 
such a Penalty Offset, Respondent agrees that he shall, within 30 days after entry of a final 
order granting the Penalty Offset, notify the Commission's counsel in this action and pay the 
amount of the Penalty Offset to the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Such a payment 
shall not be deemed an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount 
of the civil penalty imposed in this proceeding.  For purposes of this paragraph, a "Related 
Investor Action" means a private damages action brought against Respondent by or on behalf 
of one or more investors based on substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted 
by the Commission in this proceeding. 
        
                                              V. 
        
       It is further Ordered that, solely for purposes of exceptions to discharge set forth in 
Section 523 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523, the findings in this Order are true and 
admitted by Respondent, and further, any debt for disgorgement, prejudgment interest, civil 
penalty or other amounts due by Respondent under this Order or any other judgment, order, 
consent order, decree or settlement agreement entered in connection with this proceeding, is a 
debt for the violation by Respondent of the federal securities laws or any regulation or order 
issued under such laws, as set forth in Section 523(a)(19) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. 
§523(a)(19). 
         
       By the Commission.
