order of forthwith suspension of Steven M. Dombrowski (“Respondent” or “Dombrowski”) 
                                                                                         1

Certified Public Accountant (“CPA”) certificate in the State of Illinois.  After 2006, Dombrowski 
continued to hold himself out as a CPA despite not being licensed or registered as a CPA with the 
State of Illinois.    
 
       2.     On July 15, 2015, a judgment of conviction was entered against Dombrowski in 
United States v. Steven M. Dombrowski, case no. 1:14-CR-00041 in the United States District 
Court for the Northern District of Illinois, finding him guilty of one count of securities fraud by 
insider trading in the securities of Dombrowski’s former employer, Allscripts Healthcare

       Rule 102(e)(2) provides in relevant part that “any person who has been convicted of a felony or a 
misdemeanor involving moral turpitude shall be forthwith suspended from appearing or practicing before 
the Commission.”

       3.      As a result of this conviction, Dombrowski was sentenced to 12 months and 1 day

       In view of the foregoing, the Commission finds that Dombrowski has been convicted of a 
felony within the meaning of Rule 102(e)(2) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice.   
 
       Accordingly, it is ORDERED, that Steven M. Dombrowski is forthwith suspended from
