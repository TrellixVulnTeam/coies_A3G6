A.      SUMMARY 
 
        These proceedings arise out of quarterly reviews and an audit performed by 
Kempisty & Company of the financial statements of its client, Kentucky Energy, Inc. 
(Kentucky Energy),   4
                         for the year ended December 31, 2005.  In these financial 
statements, Kentucky Energy improperly accounted for warrants and convertible notes it 
had issued to third parties.  Kempisty & Company rendered an unqualified report stating 
that, in the firms opinion, the financial statements presented fairly the financial position 
of the company in conformity with    5
                                       generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  
In fact, the financial statements were not presented in conformity with GAAP and the 
resulting errors were material.  Moreover, the firm    failed to comply with Public Company 
Accounting Oversight Board (the Board) auditing standards (AU)         6
                                                                             in carrying out the 
relevant audits and reviews.   
                                                                                                                                                 
        The Commission may  . . . deny, temporarily or permanently, the privilege of appearing or 
practicing before it  to any person who is found to have willfully violated, or will fully aided and 
abetted the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or the rules and regulations thereunder. 
3
        The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondents Offers of Settlement and are not binding 
on any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding. 
4
        The company was named Quest Minerals and Mining Corp. during the relevant time.    
5
        The Kempisty & Company report did contain an explanatory paragraph describing substantial 
doubt about the entitys ability to continue as a going concern and an emphasis of matter paragraph 
describing that potential adverse rulings in ongoing litigation could result in a loss of the companys 
operating assets. 
6
        AU refers to the specific sections of the codification of the American Institute of Certified 
Public Accountants (AICPA) professional standards, known as the Statements on Auditing Standards, as 
issued by the Auditing Standards Board of the AICPA.  These standards have been adopted by the Board 
following passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  References in this order are to the standards in 
effect at the time of the relevant conduct.

C.     FACTS 
 
Issuance of convertible notes and warrants by Kentucky Energy 
       
       1.     Kentucky Energys 2005 financial statements, like those for the preceding 
year, were prepared by a consultant to the company.  This consultants father was the 
Vice President, Secretary and a director of Kentucky Energy.  Kempisty and Rubino had 
no specific knowledge of the consultants education or experience in accounting.  
        
       2.     Beginning in 2004 and continuing into 2005, Kentucky Energy obtained a 
series of loans from third parties evidenced by notes convertible into common stock.7
                                                                                      As 
an additional incentive to the lenders, Kentucky Energy issued warrants along with each 
note.  Kentucky Energys consultant needed to account for warrants for the first time in 
preparing the companys financial statements for inclusion in its Form 10-KSB for the 
year ended December 31, 2004.   Rubino had never previously dealt with the issue of 

                                                 
7
       One series of notes issued during 2005 was not convertible and one note did not have warrants 
attached, however. 

                                            3

how to account for warrants or a beneficial conversion feature of a convertible note, both 
of which are derivatives.   
                
Improper accounting for warrants and beneficial conversion feature 
        
       3.      Rubino told the consultant that he would need to value the warrants using 
the  Black-Scholes option pricing model.  Accordingly, the consultant found a Black-
Scholes calculator on the internet.  This calculator called for him to fill in variables for 
the warrants equity price, strike price, volatility, riskless interest rate, and time 
to maturity, and would then generate a Black-Scholes valuation.  For volatility and 
interest rate, however, the consultant simply inserted the generic numbers provided as 
an example by the website, rather than calculate the actual volatility of Kentucky Energy 
stock and determine the real riskless interest rate.  In fact, Kentucky Energys stock price 
was far more volatile than that listed in the website example.   
        
       4.      Using this method, the consultant arrived at a value for the warrants issued 
during the last quarter of 2004.  He recorded that value as an expense on the companys 
statement of operations and sent his draft financial statements to Kempisty & Company.    
        
       5.      Rubino, however, contacted the consultant and told him that he should 
have recorded the warrant valuation as an asset on the companys balance sheet, rather 
than as an expense on its statement of operations, and that he should then have amortized 
that amount over the life of the underlying convertible notes.  Not only was this 
accounting treatment incorrect, but both Rubino and the consultant ignored the necessity 
to provide for the beneficial conversion feature of the notes. 
        
       6.      In fact, accounting for the warrants in accordance with GAAP required 
that the proper inputs be used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model.  Kentucky 
Energy should have allocated the loan proceeds first to the notes and the warrants; and 
then, from the portion allocated to the notes, reallocated that to the notes and the 
beneficial conversion feature of the notes.  The amount of proceeds allocable to the 
warrants and the beneficial conversion feature would be accounted for as paid-in-capital 
and as a discount to the face amount of the note.  The note should have been recorded net 
of this discount on the balance sheet and the discount should have been amortized to 
interest expense in the statement of operations over the life of the notes. 
        
       7.      Rubino testified that he did not know what the consultants accounting 
background was, or whether he was familiar with GAAP.  Even after he decided that the 
consultants first set of financial statements was incorrectly prepared, Rubino took no 
further steps to verify the consultants competence.   
        
GAAP failures  
        
       8.      For the first quarter of 2005, using the same methodology established in 
2004, the consultant arrived at a value of $15,694,422 for the warrants, and that amount 
less amortization of $1,881,139, or $13,813,283 was recorded as an asset on the 

                                             4 
---------------------Page 5---------------------

companys balance sheet.  In the subsequent quarters of 2005, the consultant continued to 
calculate the warrant valuation improperly and to record it as an asset which, for each of 
the first two quarters, amounted to over 60% of Kentucky Energys total assets.  On the 
companys statements of operations, the warrant amortization expense increased 
correspondingly, and on its 2005 year-end statement of operations amounted to 70% of 
Kentucky Energys net loss.  Throughout this period, the consultant continued to fail to 
consider the effect of the beneficial conversion feature of the promissory notes.  The 
combined valuation of the warrants and the beneficial conversion features should not 
have exceeded the proceeds the company had received from the notes, which amounted 
to $1,875,000 at the end of the first quarter and $3,105,000 at the end of 2005, and they 
should not have been recorded as an asset. 
        
       9.     For its year ended December 31, 2005, as a result of its improper 
accounting for the warrants and convertible notes, Kentucky Energy recorded the warrant 
asset in the amount of $3,097,903 on its balance sheet, reflecting the ensuing quarters 
amortization as an expense on its statements of operations.  In so doing, the company 
overstated total assets by 43% and overstated its net loss by 197%.  It also materially 
overstated paid-in capital, retained deficit, shareholders equity and expenses.  This 
improper accounting was material to balance sheets and statements of operations 
contained in its quarterly filings for 2005 as well.  For example, its assets were overstated 
by approximately $13.8 million, or 213%, in the financial statements contained in its 
Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2005 and its net loss was overstated by approximately 
174% for the second quarter of 2005.  
                 
Audit and Reviews  
        
       10.    Kempisty & Company conducted quarterly reviews and a year-end audit 
of Kentucky Energys financial statements for the 2005 year.  In the report filed with the 
Form 10-KSB filed by the company on May 9, 2006, Kempisty & Company stated that 
the financial statement presented fairly the financial position of the company at 
December 31, 2005.  On these engagements, Rubino was the engagement partner and 
Kempisty was the concurring review partner.  They were the only auditors who worked 
on this engagement, and in fact were the only partners and auditors in the firm at the 
time. 
 
The Boards  auditing standards failures by Rubino as the engagement partne r 
 
       Lack of training and proficiency 
 
       11.    Rubino lacked the necessary training and proficiency as an auditor to 
properly interpret the professional guidance under GAAP having to do with accounting 
for warrants and convertible notes.  The workpapers reflect no analysis to support treating 
the warrants as assets on Kentucky Energys balance sheet.  Nevertheless, he sought no 
outside advice on these issues.  In fact, Rubino did not realize that in accounting for the 
warrants he was dealing with derivative instruments requiring a careful analysis for 
proper accounting.    

                                            5 
---------------------Page 6---------------------

        
       12.     The Boards auditing standards require that the audit be performed by "a 
person or persons having adequate technical training and proficiency as an auditor."  AU 
§ 210.01.  The Boards  Auditing Standards further require that [t]he  auditor with final 
responsibility for the engagement should know, at a minimum, the relevant professional 
accounting and auditing standards . . . .  AU § 230.06.   
        
       Failure to exercise due professional care and skepticism 
       and to obtain sufficient competent evidential matter 
        
       13.     Rubino also failed to obtain and sufficiently examine, read and understand 
all of the underlying documents evidencing the note/warrant transactions.  The 
workpapers did not contain copies of all the relevant agreements underlying the 
convertible note financings.  There is no evidence that Rubino evaluated this 
documentation to understand how the transactions should be accounted for under GAAP.   
        
       14.     Rubino knew that Kentucky Energys consultant had limited knowledge of 
accounting and GAAP, yet he failed to review in sufficient detail the Black -Scholes 
assumptions and analysis the consultant had used, therefore failing to discover that he had 
merely used the generic volatility and interest rate numbers off the website rather than 
obtain the correct numbers for Kentucky Energy.   
        
       15.     The Boards auditing standards require that "[d]ue professional care is to 
be exercised in the planning and performance of the audit and the preparation of the 
report."  AU § 230.01.  Among other things, due professional care requires that an auditor 
exercise professional skepticism, defined as "an attitude that includes a questioning mind 
and a critical assessment of audit evidence."  AU § 230.07.  Gathering and objectively 
evaluating audit evidence requires the auditor to consider the competency and sufficiency 
of the evidence.  AU § 230.08.  In exercising professional skepticism, the auditor should 
not be satisfied with less than persuasive evidence because of a belief that management is 
honest.  AU § 230.09.   
         
       16.     The Boards auditing standards also require that "[s]ufficient competent 
evidential matter is to be obtained through inspection, observation, inquiries, and 
confirmations to afford a reasonable basis for an opinion regarding the financial 
statements under audit."  AU § 326.01.  To be competent, evidence, regardless of its 
form, must be both valid and relevant.  AU § 326.21.  In addition, the auditor should 
"recognize the possibility that the financial statements may not be fairly presented in 
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ..." and should "consider 
relevant evidential matter regardless of whether it appears to corroborate or contradict the 
assertions in the financial statements."  AU § 326.25.  Management representations "are 
part of the evidential matter the independent auditor obtains, but they are not a substitute 
for the application of those auditing procedures necessary to afford a reasonable basis for 
an opinion regarding the financial statements under audit."  AU § 333.02.  
        

                                            6 
---------------------Page 7---------------------

       Failure to comply with relevant auditing standards  
       regarding auditing of derivatives 
 
       17.    In fact, the Boards auditing standards provide specific guidance to 
auditors in planning and performing auditing procedures for assertions about derivative 
instruments that are made in an entitys financial statements.  AU§ 332.  This guidance 
states that the auditor may need special skills or knowledge to plan and perform auditing 
procedures for certain assertions about derivatives and securities.  AU§ 332.05.  
        
       18.    Rubino failed to, among other things:  
        
              •      Understand the application of generally accepted accounting 
       principles for assertions about derivatives (AU§ 332.05) 
              •      Understand the determination of fair value of derivatives, 
       including the reasonableness of key assumptions (AU§ 332.05 and AU§ 332.40)      
              •      Alter its risk assessment and audit procedures based on the entitys 
       inexperience with a derivative (AU§ 332.08) 
              •      Obtain evidence supporting managements assertion about fair 
       value of the derivative (AU§ 332.35) and  
              •      Evaluate whether the presentation and disclosure of derivatives are 
       in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (AU§ 332.49). 
                              
       Thus, Rubino failed to fulfill  his responsibilities under the Boards auditing 
standards for auditing those instruments.   
          
The Boards auditing standards review failures by Rubino as the engagement partner  
 
       19.    In addition to the audit failures, Rubino failed to comply with the specific 
standards applicable to interim reviews of Kentucky Energys 2005 quarterly financial 
statements.  These standards, set forth in AU § 722, provide guidance on the nature, 
timing and extent of the procedures to be performed by an independent accountant when 
conducting a review of interim financial information.   
        
       20.     The objective of a review of interim financial information is to provide 
the accountant with a basis for communicating whether he or she is aware of any material 
modifications that should be made to the interim financial information for it to conform 
with GAAP.  AU § 722.07.  The standards specifically require the accountant to perform 
certain procedures when conducting a review of interim financial information, including, 
but not limited to inquiring of management about unusual or complex situations that may 
have an effect on the interim financial information, and matters about which questions 
have arisen in the course of applying the review procedures and significant journal entries 
and other adjustments.  AU § 722.18.   
        
       21.    The unusual or complex situations, referred to in the above paragraph, 
specifically include the use of derivative instruments and unique terms for debt that could 
affect classification.  AU § 722.55 (Appendix B).  Rubino, however, did not give 

                                            7 
---------------------Page 8---------------------

adequate consideration to the analysis and classification of the derivative instruments 
recorded in the financial statements. 
        
       22.     Finally, the same standards relating to adequate technical training and 
proficiency, due professional care and professional skepticism apply to reviews as well as 
audits.  AU § 722.01.   Therefore, Rubinos audit failures for Kentucky Energys year 
ended December 31, 2005 apply equally to the quarterly reviews.       
        
The Boards auditing standards failures by Kempisty as the concurring review partner       
 
       23.     Kempisty, as the concurring review partner, was responsible for 
performing an objective review of significant auditing, accounting, and financial 
reporting matters that came to his attention, and was an integral part of the resolution of 
matters prior to the issuance of the firm's audit report.  SEC Practice Section (SECPS) 
§1000.39 (Appendix E).  8
                           On the basis of that review, Kempisty was required to 
conclude that no matters came to his attention that caused him to believe that the 
financial statements of Kentucky Energy were not in conformity with GAAP in all 
material respects, and that the firm's audit was performed in accordance with the 
standards of the Board.   
 
       24.     Kempisty was required, among other things, to review documentation of 
the resolution of significant accounting, auditing and financial reporting matters.  His 
review of the financial statements and management documentation should have alerted 
him to the mistakes in valuing and classifying the warrants.  
        
       25.     Kempisty had additional specific responsibilities with respect to the 
concurring review of Kentucky Energys interim financial statements.  For a review 
conducted on interim financial information on financial statements in an SEC clients 
quarterly Form 10-Q or 10-QSB filing, a member firm's policies and procedures should 
require discussion with the concurring partner reviewer, prior to the completion of the 
review, about any matters identified in the review that involve a significant risk of 
material misstatement of the financial statements.  Any such involvement should be 
documented.  SECPS §1000.39 (Appendix E).   
        
       26.     Although testimony indicates that Kempisty did discuss the 
warrant/convertible note accounting issue with Rubino, the workpapers for the interim 
reviews do not contain any documentation of such discussions nor of matters identified in 
the review that involve a significant risk of material misstatement of the financial 
statements.   
 
       27.     Finally, as a general matter, Kempisty as concurring reviewer was 
required to have sufficient relevant technical expertise and experience to perform his 
                                                 
8
       This references concurring partner review standards set by the AICPA which were adopted by the 
Board following passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  Kempisty & Company was a member of the 
SEC Practice Section of the AICPA from 1991until the formation of the Board, making it subject to these 
standards.

duties.  SECPS §1000.39 (Appendix E).  In this matter he was therefore required to have 
technical expertise and experience in the area of accounting for derivatives, including 
warrants and convertible notes.  The standards also require that a concurring reviewer 
seek assistance from other individuals to supplement his knowledge when necessary.   
 
       28.    As concurring reviewer for both the interim reviews and year-end audit, 
Kempisty lacked the expertise and experience necessary to understand that the 
instruments involved in the transactions were derivatives.  He also failed to seek outside 
professional assistance to understand how to properly account for such items.  
 
Misstatement in Audit Report 
 
       29.    In this matter, Kempisty & Companys audit report falsely states that they 
conducted the audit in accordance with the standards of the Board, and that in its opinion 
the financial statements of Kentucky Energy were presented fairly, in all material 
respects, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States 
of America.  In fact, they were not. 
        
D.     VIOLATIONS 
 
       30.    Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 
thereunder require issuers with securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange 
Act to file quarterly and annual reports with the Commission and to keep this information 
current.  The obligation to file such reports embodies the requirement that they be true 
and correct.  See            , e.g., SEC v. Savoy Indus., Inc., 587 F.2d 1149, 1165 (D.C. Cir. 1978), 
cert. denied, 440 U.S. 913 (1979). 
 
       31.    As discussed above, for the year ended December 31, 2005, Kempisty & 
Company, Kempisty and Rubino caused Kentucky Energy to file false and misleading 
quarterly and annual reports with the Commission that misrepresented the financial 
results of Kentucky Energy, overstating total assets and net loss. By their conduct 
described above, Kempisty & Company, Kempisty and Rubino willfully aided and 
abetted and caused Kentucky Energys violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, 
and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder. 
 
E.     FINDINGS 
        
       1.     Based on the foregoing the Commission finds that Kempisty & Company     , 
Kempisty and Rubino willfully  aided and abetted and caused Kentucky Energys 
violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 13a-1, 13a-13 and 12b-20 
thereunder. 
               
       2.     Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that Kempisty & Company, 
Kempisty and Rubino engaged in improper professional conduct pursuant to Section 
4C(a)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) of the Commissions Rules of 
Practice, and willfully aided and abetted and caused Kentucky Energys violation of the 

                                           9 
---------------------Page 10---------------------

federal securities laws, pursuant to Section 4C(a)(3) of the Exchange Act and Rule 
102(e)(1)(iii) of the Commissions Rules of Practice. 
                                           IV. 
                                             
       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the 
sanctions agreed to in Respondents Offer s. 
 
       Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately that   : 
 
       A.     Respondents Kempisty & Company, Kempisty and Rubino shall cease and 
desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Section 13(a) 
of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and13a-13 promulgated thereunder.      
 
       B.     Kempisty & Company, Kempisty and Rubino are denied the privilege of 
appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant.   
 
       C.     After one year from the date of this Order, Kempisty may request that the 
Commission consider his reinstatement.  After three years from the date of this Order, 
Rubino may request that the Commission consider his reinstatement.   
 
       D.     Respondents Kempisty and Rubino may separately request that the 
Commission consider their reinstatement by submitting an application (attention: Office of 
the Chief Accountant) to resume appearing or practicing before the Commission as: 
      
              1.      a preparer or reviewer, or a person responsible for the preparation 
or review, of any public companys financial statements that are filed with the 
Commission.  Such an application must satisfy the Commission that Kempistys or 
Rubinos work in his practice before the Commission will be reviewed either by the 
independent audit committee of the public company for which he works or in some other 
acceptable manner, as long as he practices before the Commission in this capacity; and/or 
                    
              2.      an independent accountant.  Such an application must satisfy the 
Commission that: 
      
                      a.     Kempisty or Rubino, or the public accounting firm with 
which he is associated, is registered with the Board in accordance with the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act of 2002, and such registration continues to be effective; 
 
                      b.     Kempisty or Rubino, or the registered public accounting 
firm with which he is associated, has been inspected by the Board and that inspection did 
not identify any criticisms of or potential defects in the respondents or the firms quality 
control system that would indicate that the respondent will not receive appropriate 
supervision; 
        

                                           10 
---------------------Page 11---------------------

                      c.      Kempisty and/or Rubino has resolved all disciplinary issues 
with the Board, and has complied with all terms and conditions of any sanctions imposed 
by the Board (other than reinstatement by the Commission); and  
 
                      d.      Kempisty and/ or Rubino acknowledges his responsibility, 
as long as that Respondent appears or practices before the Commission as an independent 
accountant, to comply with all requirements of the Commission and the Board   , including, 
but not limited to, all requirements relating to registration, inspections, concurring partner 
reviews and quality control standards.   
      
       E.      The Commission will consider an application by Kempisty or Rubino to 
resume appearing or practicing before the Commission provided that his state CPA 
license is current and he has resolved all other disciplinary issues with the applicable state 
boards of accountancy.  However, if state licensure is dependent on reinstatement by the 
Commission, the Commission will consider an application on its other merits.  The 
Commissions review may include consideration of, in addition to the matters referenced 
above, any other matters relating to Respondents character, integrity, professional 
conduct, or qualifications to appear or practice before the Commission. 
 
       By the Commission.
