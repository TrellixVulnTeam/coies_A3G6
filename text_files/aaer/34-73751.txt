                                                III. 
 
                                                                                1
       On the basis of this Order and Petrovich’s Offer, the Commission finds     that :   
 
                                             Summary 
 
       This matter involves the accounting treatment by Hampton Roads Bankshares, Inc. 
(“HRBS” or the “Company”) in connection with the recording of its deferred tax asset (“DTA”) in 
2009 and 2010.  Petrovich was the Chief Financial Officer of HRBS from February 2009 through 
May 2010.  During 2009 and the first quarter of 2010, HRBS recorded a large DTA without taking 
                                            2
a significant valuation allowance against it.   HRBS, relying on an analysis performed under  
Petrovich’s direction, concluded that based on anticipated future earnings, the Company was 
“more likely than not” to realize its DTA within the applicable carry-forward period.  This 
conclusion was unreasonable because the financial projections underlying HRBS’s projections of 
future earnings were not supportable based on the Company’s financial condition, including in 
particular the ongoing deterioration of its loan portfolio.   
 
       HRBS’s financial condition was deteriorating by early 2010, and the Company was 
discussing remedial measures to address its problems.  HRBS was facing possible adverse 
regulatory consequences.  In August 2010, HRBS amended its 2009 Form 10-K and first quarter 
2010 Form 10-Q to include restated financial statements, reflecting a valuation allowance against 
the DTA, reducing the reported DTA for 2009 from over $56 million to less than $400,000, and to 
$0 thereafter.  In its restated Form 10-K for 2009, HRBS reported that it was “undercapitalized” as 
of December 31, 2009, as opposed to “adequately capitalized,” as originally reported.  Similarly, in 
its restated Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2010, HRBS reported that it was “significantly 
undercapitalized,” rather than “undercapitalized” as originally reported. 
        
       Accordingly, Petrovich was a cause of HRBS’s violations of the reporting, books and 
records and internal controls provisions of the Exchange Act.    
 
                                          Respondent 
 
       1.      Neal Petrovich, 52, is a resident of Chesapeake, Virginia, and was HRBS’s 
Executive Vice President and CFO from February 2009 through May 2010.  On May 13, 2010, 
Petrovich informed HRBS of his intention to end his employment with HRBS effective June 4, 
2010, and he left the company on that date.  Petrovich is currently employed as Senior Vice 
President – Finance with a publicly traded financial services company in the area.  He is a licensed 
CPA in Virginia.

         The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent’s Offer of Settlement and are not binding 
on any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.  
       2
         HRBS did establish a $1 million valuation allowance in 2009 related to capital losses realized, against the 
$2.8 million in capital loss carryforwards.  However, HRBS recorded a net DTA of $56.38 million in its 2009 Form 
10-K, the vast majority of which related to its loan losses.

                                    Other Relevant Entity 

       2.     Hampton Roads Bankshares, Inc., a Virginia corporation with its principal place of 
business in Virginia Beach, Virginia, is a bank holding company for Bank of Hampton Roads 
(“BOHR”) and Shore Bank (“Shore”), its primary subsidiaries.  At all relevant times, HRBS’s 
common stock was registered with the Commission under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and was listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market 
(“NASDAQ”).  HRBS was subject to periodic examinations by the Virginia State Corporation 
Commission’s Bureau of Financial Institutions (the “SCC”) and the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Richmond (the “FRB”) in 2009 and 2010.   

                                             Facts 
 
HRBS History: 2008-09 Mergers and Subsequent Loan Losses 
 
       3.     HRBS’s two primary subsidiaries, BOHR and Shore, provide community and 
commercial banking services to individuals and small-to-medium-sized businesses in the 
Hampton Roads region of southeastern Virginia; Richmond, Virginia; the Northeastern and 
Research Triangle regions of North Carolina; and the Eastern Shore of Virginia and Maryland. 
HRBS acquired Shore on June 1, 2008.  On December 31, 2008, HRBS acquired all outstanding 
shares of Gateway Financial Holdings, Inc. (“Gateway”).  At the time of the acquisition, 
Gateway’s subsidiaries, including Gateway Bank & Trust Co. (“Gateway Bank”), became 
wholly owned subsidiaries of HRBS.  On May 8, 2009, Gateway Bank merged into BOHR, with 
BOHR being the surviving entity.  The acquisition of Gateway increased HRBS’s assets from 
slightly under $1 billion to approximately $3.1 billion.   

       4.     The performance of HRBS’s loan portfolio deteriorated during 2009, leading to 
losses.  The Company disclosed in its 2009 Form 10-K that “our problem loans increased 
significantly in 2009; loans acquired from [Gateway] have been the primary source of that 
increase.  Deteriorating economic conditions, difficulties in loan administration, and insufficient 
loan collection resources contributed to the credit quality problems.”  Prior to restating its 
financials in August 2010, HRBS reported a net loss of $60.7 million for fiscal year 2009, 
excluding the write down of goodwill of $84.8 million.  The company’s restated financials 
reflected a net loss of $116.65 million, excluding the goodwill write-downs. 

       5.     On August 10, 2010, HRBS announced that its financial statements for fiscal year 
ended December 31, 2009, as included in its 2009 Form 10-K, and the financial statements for the 
fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2010, as included in its first quarter 2010 Form 10-Q, should no 
longer be relied upon because HRBS had determined that restatements were necessary to provide 
for an increase in the valuation allowance against the Company’s deferred tax asset.  On August 13, 
2010, HRBS filed restated annual financial statements for 2009 in an amended Form 10-K for 2009, 
and restated quarterly financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2010, in an amended 
Form 10-Q.  The restated financial statements included a valuation allowance of approximately $56 
million  for the year ended December 31, 2009, and of an additional $14.3 million for the first 
quarter of 2010.  These valuation allowances reduced HRBS’s reported DTA as of year-end 2009 
from $56.4 million to $397,000, and as of March 31, 2010 from $70.3 million to $0.

Deferred Tax Assets: Description and Accounting Guidance 
    
       6.      Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 740 (formerly FASB statement 109) 
establishes standards for companies to account for and report the effects of income taxes.  A 
deferred tax asset is an asset on a company’s balance sheet that represents the right to offset a 
future tax expense or obligation with a future tax benefit or refund.  These assets arise as a result of 
timing differences that occur between reporting the effect of taxes accounted for under U.S. GAAP 
and calculating tax benefits and liabilities under the enacted tax law.  For example, due to 
differences between tax laws and accounting standards for financial statement purposes, some 
events are recognized for financial reporting purposes and for tax purposes in different years. This 
can give rise to differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts 
in financial statements.  These differences are temporary because the event will become taxable or 
deductible in the future.  A deferred tax asset, or DTA, exists when temporary timing differences 
are more likely than not to result in deductible amounts in future years.  Deferred tax assets can 
arise in connection with a company’s allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL), which was the 
case for the vast majority of HRBS’s DTA.  

       7.      A DTA is recorded on the balance sheet when it is more likely than not that the 
DTA will be realized in a future period.  However, ASC 740-10-30 requires a company to 
“[r]educe deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available 
evidence, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that some portion or all 
of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  The valuation allowance shall be sufficient to reduce 
the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.”  The company must 
weigh all positive and negative evidence in determining whether a valuation allowance is 
necessary.   

       8.      When considering the weighing of positive and negative evidence, the accounting 
guidance under ASC 740-10-30-21 and -23 states: “[f]orming a conclusion that a valuation 
allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in 
recent years,” and “[a] cumulative loss in recent years is a significant piece of negative evidence 
that is difficult to overcome.”  ASC 740-10-30-21 provides other examples of negative evidence, 
including “losses expected in early future years (by a presently profitable entity)” and “unsettled 
circumstances that, if unfavorably resolved, would adversely affect future operations and profit 
levels on a continuing basis in future years.”  The realizability of DTAs must be evaluated in each 
reporting period. 

HRBS’s Loan Losses and Increasing DTA  
 
       9.      Prior to 2008, HRBS did not record a significant DTA.  As of the end of 2007, the 
Company recorded a net DTA of $2.66 million, and that number decreased through the first three 
quarters of 2008.  Gateway, however, had seen an increase in its DTA during 2008 due to a 
deteriorating loan portfolio and a corresponding increase in loan losses.  As of the end of 2008 – 
following the merger with Gateway – HRBS recorded a DTA of $32.6 million.   

       10.    As HRBS disclosed in its Form 10-K for 2009, “our problem loans increased 
significantly in 2009; loans acquired from [Gateway] have been the primary source of that 

                                                                                                    
                                                 4

increase.  Deteriorating economic conditions, difficulties in loan administration, and insufficient 
loan collection resources contributed to the credit quality problems.”  Prior to its restatement, 
HRBS reported $60.7 million in losses for 2009 (exclusive of its goodwill write-downs), and 
recorded provisions for loan losses of $33.71 million, $33.66 million, $65.67 million, and $45.61 
million for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2009 and the first quarter of 2010, respectively.  

       11.    Consequently, after a slight dip in the first quarter of 2009 from $32.62 million to 
$31.28 million, HRBS’S DTA increased through the end of the first quarter of 2010 along with the 
company’s loan losses.  HRBS recorded a DTA of $44.22 million for the second quarter of 2009, 
$37.00 million for the third quarter of 2009, $56.38 million for the fourth quarter and year-end of 
2009, and $70.32 million in the first quarter of 2010. 

       12.    The vast majority of the DTA recorded by HRBS for 2009 and the first quarter of 
2010 related to the Company’s loan losses.  Prior to its restatement in August 2010, HRBS did not 
establish a valuation against its DTA relating to its loan losses.  The only valuation allowance 
HRBS established against its DTA in this period was a $1 million allowance relating to capital 
losses realized, against the Company’s $2.8 million in capital loss carryforwards.   

HRBS’s DTA Analysis 
        
       13.    In November 2009, HRBS, under Petrovich’s direction, conducted an analysis of 
“whether [HRBS] can continue to justify carrying [the deferred tax assets] at the amount they are 
recorded in the general ledger.”  The resulting memorandum concluded no valuation allowance 
was required.  The memorandum was based in part on capital projections forecasting loan 
performance through the end of 2010, prepared by Petrovich and others under his direction, which 
assumed the Company would work through existing non-performing loans (“NPLs”) in 24-36 
months and would earn a consistent $8.4 million in quarterly pre-tax, pre-provision income ($33.6 
million annually).  Petrovich knew or should have known that these conclusions were not 
reasonable.  The projections underlying the analysis assumed that the provision for loan losses 
would drop from over $33 million in third quarter 2009 to $2.35 million by the end of 2010.  
However, at the same time, internal company reports that were circulated to Petrovich reflected 
that as of November 2009, the company’s total delinquent and non-accruing loans had reached 
nearly $350 million, or 13.4% of total loans, an increase over the quarter-end totals for each of the 
first through third quarters of 2009.  Likewise, non-performing assets had increased 11% from 
September to October 2009, continuing a trend of increases in problem loans since late 2008.  
HRBS reported a provision for loan losses for the third quarter of 2009 of $33.7 million, and for 
fourth quarter 2009 of $65.7 million.  Further, HRBS’s DTA analysis relied on “pre-tax, pre-
provision” income, and did not address the fact that the existing loan loss provisions were the 
single greatest driver of the Company’s losses at the time, and that loan losses would be based on 
the trends noted above indicating that these losses would likely continue.     

       14.    From December 2009 through July 2010, HRBS provided materials to the SEC’s 
Division of Corporation Finance (“Corp Fin”) and Office of the Chief Accountant (“OCA”) 
concerning its conclusions that a valuation allowance was not required on its DTA, and that the 
financial projections supporting its analysis were supportable, notwithstanding the fact that the 

                                                                                                   
                                                5 
---------------------Page 6---------------------

Company’s loan losses in 2009 had exceeded the aggregate taxable income for the prior three 
years, and were continuing.   

       15.    In March of 2010, Petrovich and others under his direction prepared an internal 
memorandum setting forth an analysis of the necessity of a valuation allowance against the DTA as 
of year-end 2009.  HRBS retained an outside accounting consultant to provide limited assistance in 
directing the Company to the appropriate accounting guidance and memorializing the Company’s 
            3
conclusions.    The  March 2010 memo  randum   concluded that HRBS would more likely than not 
earn the necessary $8 million future taxable income per year ($150  - 160 million total) necessary to 
fully utilize the DTA over the applicable carry- forward period.  The analysis relied  , in part, on the 
Company  ’s historical pre-Gateway earnings over the prior four years ($5.5 million, $6.0 million, 
$6.8 million, and $7.2 million for 2005-08, respectively), concluding that the Company would 
more likely than not earn the necessary $8 million future taxable income per year.  The 
memorandum recognized that excluding non-recurring write-offs of goodwill associated with 
Shore Bank and Gateway, HRBS had suffered $64 million in pre-tax losses in 2009, which was 
“approximately double the income earned over the prior 5 years,” but noted that HRBS “do[es] not 
expect losses to continue past 2011.”  Petrovich knew or should have known that the conclusions 
in the March 2010 memorandum were not reasonable.  At the time this analysis was drafted, total 
loans past due had trended upward since the beginning of 2009, and total delinquent and 
nonaccrual loans, while slightly lower than in February 2010, remained at historically high levels.      

       16.    On April 23, 2010, HRBS filed its Form 10-K for 2009, signed by Petrovich, which 
incorporated financial statements recording a DTA of $56.38 million, including a valuation 
allowance of $1.0 million established against the Company’s $2.8 million in capital loss 
carryforwards, but no valuation allowance relating to the remainder of the DTA, including the 
portion of the DTA attributable to loan losses.  The March 2010 DTA memorandum reflecting 
HRBS’s rationale for this accounting decision was substantially reproduced in the footnotes to the 
financial statements included in the Company’s 2009 Form 10-K. 

       17.    In May 2010, HRBS, under Petrovich’s direction, updated the analysis of whether a 
valuation allowance was required on the DTA for purposes of HRBS’s first quarter 2010 financial 
statements.  The identification and weighing of positive and negative evidence remained 
substantively unchanged from the March 2010 memorandum, though the updated memorandum 
noted that the required annual taxable income to fully utilize the Company’s DTA was now an 
average of $9 million, rather than $8 million.  The May 2010 memorandum supported its 
conclusion that this level would likely be reached by, in part, noting that HRBS, Gateway and 
Shore Bank had earned a combined $31 million in 2007, the last full year prior to the mergers.  The 
memorandum predicted that HRBS would become profitable in 2011, and attached bank-level 
capital projections, also drafted by Petrovich and others under his direction, that forecasted a slight 
profit as of third quarter of 2011, notwithstanding the Company’s internal consolidated projections 
less than two months prior that projected quarterly losses of at least $7 million through 2011.  
Petrovich knew or should have known that the conclusions in the May 2010 memorandum were 
not reasonable.  Internal Company reports as of late May 2010 reflected continuing deterioration of 

                                                 
3
        The outside accounting consultant did not provide an opinion on the validity of the company’s conclusions 
and relied on the projections and assumptions that HRBS used in performing the DTA analysis.

HRBS’s loan portfolio through increasing levels of classified loans, past due loans, delinquent and 
nonaccrual loans, and nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans.  

       18.    On May 17, 2010, HRBS filed its Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 
31, 2010.  The Form 10-Q incorporated financial statements recording a DTA of $70.32 million, 
including the previously-established a valuation allowance of $1.0 million against HRBS’s $2.8 
million in capital loss carryforwards.  The financial statements again established no valuation 
allowance relating to the remainder of the DTA, including the portion of the DTA attributable to 
loan losses.   

       19.    On May 13, 2010, Petrovich informed HRBS’s Board of Directors and senior 
management of his intention to end his employment with the Company, effective June 4, 2010.  On 
June 4, 2010, Petrovich left HRBS.   

       20.    On August 13, 2010, HRBS issued an amended Form 10-K/A for 2009 and an 
amended 10-Q/A for the first quarter of 2010, restating the financial results for those periods to 
reflect a valuation allowance against the entire DTA.   

The Effects of HRBS’s DTA On Its Reported Capitalization Levels  

       21.    The valuation allowance against HRBS’s DTA played a role in determining the 
Company’s capitalization level, a measure that banks are required to report quarterly under bank 
regulations.  A portion of a bank’s DTA is included in its Tier 1 capital calculation.  Prior to its 
restatement, HRBS reported that it was “adequately capitalized” as of December 31, 2009, and 
“undercapitalized” as of March 31, 2010.  Following the restatement, HRBS changed this 
statement to report that it was “undercapitalized” as of December 31, 2009, and “significantly 
undercapitalized” as of March 31, 2010.   

       22.    Changes in regulatory classification are material information to investors.  A bank 
that falls below certain regulatory capital classifications can be subject to adverse regulatory 
actions by bank regulators that severely restrict its activities.  Such activities can include the 
requirement that a bank that becomes “undercapitalized” submit and obtain approval of a “capital 
restoration plan,” and may also include requiring the institution to be recapitalized, prohibiting 
asset growth, restricting interest rates paid, requiring prior approval of capital distributions by a 
controlling bank holding company, requiring new election of directors or dismissal of directors and 
officers, and requiring regulatory approval of proposed dividends or consent to consolidation or 
divestiture of the institution or its affiliates.    

                                            Violations 

       23.    As a result of the conduct described above, Petrovich was a cause of HRBS’s 
violation of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder, 
which require every issuer of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act to 
file with the Commission accurate periodic reports, including annual reports on Form 10-K and 
quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and mandate that the required reports must contain any further 
material information necessary to make the required statements made in the reports not 
misleading.

make and keep books, records, and accounts which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly 
reflect their transactions and dispositions of their assets.   

       25.    As a result of the conduct described above, Petrovich was a cause of HRBS’s 
violation of Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, which requires issuers of securities 
registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act to devise and maintain a system of internal 
accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as 
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles.

                      Payments by check or money order shall be accompanied by a cover letter 
                      identifying Neal A. Petrovich as a Respondent in these proceedings, and the

                      Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F St., NE, Washington, DC 
                      20549-5010. 

       In determining whether to accept Petrovich’s Offer, the Commission has considered this 
undertaking.  Petrovich agrees that if the Division of Enforcement believes that Petrovich has not

satisfied this undertaking, it may petition the Commission to reopen the matter to determine 
whether additional sanctions are appropriate. 

                                                  

                                               IV.

agreed to in the Offer. 
 
       Accordingly, pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, it is hereby ORDERED that: 
 
       A.      Petrovich cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future 
violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 
13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder. 

 
       By the Commission.
