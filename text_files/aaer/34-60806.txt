purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings 
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these 
proceedings, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Public 
Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making Findings,

       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds 2
                                                                                 that:  
 
                                           Summary 
 
       1.      These proceedings arise out of a fraudul  ent scheme pursuant to which former    
officers of Hollinger International, Inc., now known as Sun-Times Media Group, Inc. (“Hollinger  
International”) diverted corporate funds to themselves through a series of related party transactions  
involving purported non-competitio n payments. As part of the sc     heme, these former officers 
misrepresented or omitted to state material    facts regarding the    purported non-competition 
payments to the Audit Committe  e of Hollinger International’s   Board of Directors (“Audit 
Committee”) and Hollinger International’s Board of Directors and caused Hollinger International 
to make material misstatements regarding the related party transactions in its periodic reports and 
proxy statements filed with the Commission.  
 
                                          Respondent  
 
       2.      Atkinson, currently incarcerated at Allenwood Federal Correction Center in White  
Deer, PA, is 62 years old and a citizen a                             nd resident of Canada.  Atkinson is a licensed attorney in 
Canada.  From approximately 2000 until April 27, 2004, he served as an Executive Vice President 
of Hollinger International.   From approximately May 2002 until January 2004, he served as a  
Director of Hollinger International.  From early 1996 until January 2004, Atkinson was also Vice 
President and a Director of Hollinger Inc.  In May 2000, he was appointed General Counsel of 
Hollinger Inc.  In 2002, he became an Executive Vice President of Hollinger Inc., a position from 
which he resigned on April 27, 2004.  From approximately 1996 until 2004, he also served as the 
Executive Vice President of The Ravelston Corporation Limited and Ravelston Management, Inc.  
(jointly “Ravelston”), of which he indirectly owned approximately .97%.  On November 17, 2005, 
the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois indicted Atkinson on six counts of mail and 
wire fraud in connection with his receipt of and failure to disclose certain of the purported non-
competition payments discussed herein.  In July 2007, Atkinson was found  guilty of three counts 
of mail fraud.  On December 10, 2007, Atkinson was sentenced to 24 months imprisonment, 
ordered to pay a fine of $3,000, and held jointly and severally liable for forfeiture of $6.1 million.

  The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent's Offer of Settlement and are not binding on any other   
person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

                               Other Relevant Individuals and Entities  
        
       3.     At all times relevant, Hollinger International was a Delaware corporation with its 
principal place of business in Chicago, Illinois. During the relevant period, Hollinger International 
owned and operated newspaper publishing businesses in the United States and abroad, including 
the Chicago Sun-Times, The Daily Telegraph in London, England, The Jerusalem Post  in Israel 
and a number of other publications.  During the relevant period, Hollinger International’s stock 
was comprised of Class A and Class B stock.  Hollinger International’s Class A Common Stock 
was registered with the Commission under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, and its shares were 
traded on the New York Stock Exchange.  Hollinger International’s Class B Common Shares were 
directly and indirectly owned by Hollinger Inc.  
        
       4.     At all times relevant, Hollinger Inc.  was a publicly held Canadian company with its 
principal place of business located in Toronto, Canada.  Hollinger Inc.’s shares were traded on the 
Toronto Stock Exchange.  Hollinger Inc. was also a foreign private issuer whose shares were 
registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act.  Hollinger Inc.’s 
primary holding was its shares of Hollinger International stock.  During 1998 through 2003, 
Hollinger Inc. was the controlling shareholder of Hollinger International through its direct and 
indirect ownership of all of the approximately 14,990,000 shares of Hollinger International’s Class 
B Common Stock, which had a 10-to-1 voting preference over shares of Hollinger International’s 
Class A Common Stock.  Hollinger Inc. also held several million shares of Hollinger 
International’s Class A Common Stock.  The remaining Class A shares were held primarily by 
public shareholders.  Hollinger Inc. was controlled by Ravelston.  
 
       5.     Conrad Black (“Black”), currently incarcerated, was the Chairman of Hollinger 
International from approximately October 1995 until January 17, 2004, and Chief Executive 
Officer (“CEO”) from October 1995 until November 19, 2003.  At all times relevant, Black was 
the Chairman and CEO of  Ravelston, and, through Conrad Black Capital Corp., was Ravelston’s 
65.1% majority stockholder.  At all times relevant, Black, through Ravelston, was the controlling 
shareholder of Hollinger Inc., which, in turn, held voting control over Hollinger International.  In 
late 2005, the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois charged Black with several counts 
of mail and wire fraud, money laundering, racketeering, and obstruction of justice in connection 
with his receipt of and failure to disclose certain purported non-competition payments.  In July 
2007, after a four month trial, Black was found guilty of three counts of mail fraud in connection 
with certain of these payments  and one count of obstruction of justice.  On December 10, 2007, 
Black was sentenced to 78 months imprisonment, fined $125,000, and pursuant to the U.S. 
Attorney’s forfeiture motion, found jointly and severally liable for the $6.1 million in ill-gotten 
“non-competition” payments received by him and the other criminal defendants.   
        
       6.     F. David Radler (“Radler”) was Deputy Chairman, Director, President and Chief 
Operating Officer (“COO”) of Hollinger International and former Publisher of the Chicago Sun-
Times, a subsidiary of Hollinger International, until he resigned on November 17, 2003.  At all 
times relevant, Radler was also the Deputy Chairman and COO of Hollinger Inc. and was also the 
President of Ravelston, and owned approximately 14.2% of stock in Ravelston through F.D. 
Radler Limited.  On August 18, 2005, Radler was indicted on seven counts of mail and wire fraud 

                                               3
  
---------------------Page 4---------------------

in connection with his receipt of  and failure to disclose certain of the non-competition payments.  
On September 20, 2005, Radler pled guilty to one count of mail fraud in connection with his 
receipt of and failure to disclose certain of the non-competition payments.  On December 17, 2007, 
Radler was sentenced to 29 months imprisonment, and ordere d to pay a fine of $250,000. 
        
       7.     John A. Boultbee (“Boultbee”), currently incarcerated, is a chartered accountant in 
Canada.  From 1990 until 1995, Boultbee served as a Director of Hollinger International, and from 
1995 until 1999, he served as the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) of Hollinger International, after 
which time he became an Executive Vice President of Hollinger International.  However, in 2000 
and 2001, he acted as CFO of Hollinger International.   He remained an Executive Vice President  
of Hollinger International until November 17, 2003.  From approximately 1987 to 2004, Boultbee 
served on the Board of Directors of Hollinger Inc. and was the CFO and Executive Vice President 
of Hollinger Inc.  Boultbee was also an Executive Vice President of Ravelston, of which he 
indirectly owned approximately .97%.  On November 17 and December 15, 2005, the U.S. 
Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois indicted Boultbee on nine counts of mail and wire 
fraud in connection with his receipt of and failure to disclose certain purported non-competition 
payments.  In July 2007, Boultbee was found guilty of three counts of mail fraud.  On December 
10, 2007, Boultbee was sentenced to 27 months imprisonment, ordered to pay restitution of 
$152,000, and held jointly and severally liable for forfeiture of $6.1 million. 
 
       8.     Mark S. Kipnis (“Kipnis”) was, from January 1998 until November 2003, the 
Secretary and Vice President, Law of Hollinger International.  He served as the General Counsel 
for Hollinger International’s Chicago newspapers.  On August 18 and November 17, 2005, the 
U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois indicted Kipnis on nine counts of mail and wire 
fraud in connection with the non-competition payments discussed herein.  Kipnis was found guilty 
of two counts of mail fraud and on December 10, 2007, was sentenced to five years probation and 
was held jointly and severally liable for forfeiture of $5.5 million. 
 
                                             Facts  
 
       9.     In 2001, Atkinson received a total of $152,500 in purported non-competition 
payments in connection with Hollinger International’s sales of certain of its U.S. community 
newspapers to Forum Communications Company (“Forum”) and PMG Acquisition Corporation 
(“Paxton”) and from American Publishing Company, a Hollinger International subsidiary.   

       10.    On September 30, 2000, Forum and Hollinger International entered into an asset 
purchase agreement for approximately $14 million, of which $400,000 was allocated to a non-
competition agreement.  On October 2, 2000, Paxton and Hollinger International entered into an 
asset purchase agreement for approximately $59 million, of which $2 million was allocated to a 
non-competition agreement.  Neither the asset purchase agreements nor the non-competition 
agreements provided for non-competition agreements with or non-competition payments to any 
individual executive officers of Hollinger International.   

       11.    In April 2001, approximately six months after the transactions had closed, Black 
and Radler paid themselves $285,000 each and Atkinson and Boultbee $15,000 each from the 
reserves of the Forum and Paxton transactions as purported “supplemental non-competition 
                                               4
  
---------------------Page 5---------------------

payments.”  Black, Radler, Atkinson and Boultbee were not parties to and did not execute non-
competition agreements in connection with these transactions.  Atkinson knew that he had not 
executed non-competition agreements and was not entitled to non-competition payments in 
connection with these transactions. 

       12.    In February 2001, Black, Radler, Atkinson, Boultbee and Kipnis orchestrated the 
payment of $5.5 million in purported non-competition payments, $2,612,500 each to Black and 
Radler and $137,500 each to Atkinson and Boultbee, from American Publishing Company, a  
Hollinger International subsidiary.  There was no sale of newspapers associated with these 
payments, and no reason for the individuals to execute agreements not to compete with a Hollinger  
International subsidiary.  Moreover, at the time, American Publishing Company owned only one 
small community newspaper which it sold shortly thereafter for $1.   

       13.    Kipnis prepared non-competition agreements between American Publishing 
Company and Black, Radler, Atkinson and Boultbee  and backdated the non-competition 
agreements to December 31, 2000.  On February 8, 2001, Kipnis sent the non-competition 
agreements to Atkinson, which Atkinson returned in executed form on or about March 1, 2001.  
The non-competition payments to the individuals were made in February 2001, but Kipnis caused  
the checks to be backdated to December 31, 2000.   

       14.    It was the policy and practice of Hollinger International that related party 
transactions were to be reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee.  Atkinson did not present 
the American Publishing Company and Paxton and Forum non-competition payments to Hollinger 
International’s Audit Committee or Board for review or approval.  In addition, Atkinson failed to 
disclose his receipt of these purported non-competition payments in his responses to the  
questionnaires used by Hollinger International to prepare its proxy statements and Forms 10-K.    
 
       15.    Hollinger International’s filings with the Commission contained misstatements and 
omissions of material fact regarding the non-competition payments made in connection with the 
American Publishing Company and Forum and Paxton transactions.  The non-competition 
payments to the executives were not disclosed in Hollinger International’s 2000 Form 10-K or 
2001 proxy statement and were not disclosed in any way to Hollinger International’s shareholders  
until Hollinger International’s 2001 Form 10-K filed on April 1, 2002.   
        
       16.    The disclosure in the 2001 Form 10-K stated: 
 
       In connection with the sales of United States newspaper properties in 2000, to 
       satisfy a closing condition, the Company, Lord Black and three senior executives 
       entered into non-competition agreements with the purchasers . . .  for aggregate 
       consideration paid in 2001 of $0.6 million.  These amounts were in addition to the 
       aggregate consideration paid in respect of these non-competition agreements in 
       2000 of $15 million. Such amounts were paid to Lord Black and the three senior 
       executives. The Company’s independent directors have approved the terms of these 
       payments. 

                                               5
  
---------------------Page 6---------------------

       17.    Hollinger International’s 2002 Form 10-K filed on March 31, 2003 contained a 
nearly identical disclosure.  Hollinger International’s 2002 proxy statement filed on April 2, 2002 
contained a similar disclosure, but also reported that $7,197,500 was paid to  Black and Radler each 
and $602,500 was paid to Atkinson and Boultbee each.  

       18.    Atkinson participated in preparing Hollinger International’s proxy statements and 
Forms 10-K and reviewed and approved the relevant disclosures contained in these filings. 
Atkinson also signed Hollinger International’s 2002 Form 10-K.    

       19.    Hollinger International’s disclosures in its 2001 and 2002 Forms 10-K and in its 
2002 proxy statement regarding the non-competition payments to the  executives were materially 
false and misleading because: (1) the American Publishing Company and Forum and Paxton non-
competition agreements and payments were not made “to satisfy a closing condition” or required 
by a purchaser and were not made  in connection with the sales of newspaper properties; (2) the  
individuals did not execute non-competition agreements in connection with the Forum or Paxton 
payments; (3) only $9.5 million in non-competition payments were paid in 2000 and another $6 
million, specifically the American Publishing Company and Forum and Paxton payments, was paid 
in 2001; and (4) the payments were not approved by Hollinger International’s independent 
directors. 
 
       20.    Hollinger Inc.’s 2002 proxy statement filed on its Form 6-K on April 23, 2002 also 
contained materially false and misleading statements regarding the non-competition payments to 
the individuals in connection with the U.S. newspaper transactions.  The 2002 Form 6-K reported: 
        
       In connection with the sales of United States newspaper properties in 2000, to 
       satisfy a closing condition, Hollinger [Inc.], Hollinger International, Lord Black and 
       Messrs. Radler, Atkinson and Boultbee entered into non-competition agreements 
       with the purchasers . . . for aggregate consideration paid in 2001 and 2000 of 
       U.S.$15,600,000, consisting of U.S.$7,197,500 paid to Lord Black, U.S.$7,197,500 
       paid to Mr. Radler, U.S.$602,500 paid to Mr. Atkinson and U.S.$602,500 paid to 
       Mr. Boultbee. 
        
       21.    Hollinger Inc.’s 2001 annual report filed on its Form 40-F on May 22, 2002 
contained a similar disclosure, stating: 
        
        [i]n connection with the sales of United States newspaper properties in 2000, to  
       satisfy a closing condition, Hollinger International, Lord Black and three senior 
       executives entered into non-competition agreements with purchasers …for 
       aggregate consideration paid in 2001 of U.S. $600,000 ($917,000).  These amounts 
       were in addition to the aggregate consideration paid in respect to these non-
       competition agreements in 2000 of U.S. $15 million ($22.5 million).  All such 
       amounts were paid to Lord Black and the three senior executives.  The independent 
       directors of Hollinger International have approved the terms of the payments.   

Hollinger Inc.’s 2002 Form 20-F filed on June 27, 2003 and its amended 2002 Form 20-F/A filed 
on September 17, 2003 contained a nearly identical disclosure.   
                                               6
  
---------------------Page 7---------------------

        22.    Atkinson participated in drafting and reviewed and approved the Hollinger 
 International disclosures described above, which he knew served as the basis for Hollinger Inc.’s 
 disclosures.  He also participated in the drafting of and reviewed and approved Hollinger Inc.’s 
 disclosures.  Atkinson reviewed and approved the 2001 and 2002 financial statements and the 2002 
 Proxy during Hollinger Inc. Board meetings, and failed to ensure that those filings disclosed the 
 true facts concerning the related party payments.                          

        23.    For the reasons discussed above in paragraph 19, the disclosures contained in 

 Hollinger Inc.’s filings regarding the non-competition payments were also materially false and 

 misleading.  

  
        24.     Atkinson knew or was reckless in not knowing that the Hollinger International and 
Hollinger Inc. filings discussed above contained materially false and misleading information 
concerning the American Publishing Company, Forum and Paxton non-competition agreements and 
payments.  Atkinson knew or was reckless in not knowing that the purchasers in Forum and Paxton 
did not request him to sign non-competition agreements or receive funds and that there was no non-
competition agreement with Paxton or Forum and any of the executives.  Atkinson also knew that 
the American Publishing Company “non-competition” payments were not in connection with any 
sale of newspapers.  He also knew that only $9.5 million in non-competition payments were paid in 
2000 and another $6 million was paid in 2001.  Finally, Atkinson knew or was reckless in not 
knowing that the payments had not been approved by Hollinger International’s independent 
directors.  Atkinson also knew that the executives had received purported non-competition 
payments that were not disclosed in the 2000 Form 10-K and 2001 proxy statement.    
 
        25.     Atkinson has paid to Hollinger International, with interest, all of the non-
competition monies he received.  In total, Atkinson has paid more than $2,798,424 to Hollinger 
International.  Atkinson has also paid certain criminal monetary penalties and forfeiture amounts 
assessed against him.   
         
                                           Violations  
  
        26.    Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that Atkinson willfully violated 
 Sections 10(b), 13(b)(5), and 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1,14a-3 and 14a-9 
 thereunder; willfully aided and abetted and caused Hollinger International’s violations of Sections 
 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 14a-3 and 14a-
