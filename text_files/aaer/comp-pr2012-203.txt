        Plaintiff, Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission), for its Complaint 

 against Krishnan alleges as follows: 

                                    INTRODUCTION 

        1.    This matter involves a course of conduct by Subramanian Krishnan (Krishnan), 

 former Chief Financial Officer of Digi International, Inc. (Digi or the Company), which 

 resulted in the filing of inaccurate reports and accompanying certifications in the Companys 

 annual reports on Form 10-K and in the Companys quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the 

 period from March 2005 through May 2010.

      CASE 0:12-cv-02495-PAM-JJG   Document 1   Filed 09/28/12   Page 2 of 14

       2.     Krishnan, in his role as Chief Financial Officer, caused Digi to make material 

misstatements or omissions in annual and quarterly reports filed with the Commission and 

engaged in certain actions and inactions, a result of which corporate funds were used to pay for 

unauthorized expenses.  

       3.     Krishnan authorized such expenses for   Digi employees, resulting in the filing of 

inaccurate expense reports, caused the Company to file inaccurate reports, failed to enforce 

Digis internal controls, demonstrated a lack of management integrity, failed to act to reveal 

inaccurate reports and wrongly certified that he evaluated the effectiveness of Digis internal 

controls and disclosed they were effective. 

                                 JURISDICTION AND VENUE 

       4.     This Court has subject matter jurisdiction by authority of Section 20 and 21 of the 

Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t, 77v] and Sections 21 and 27 of the 

Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u and 78aa]. 

       5.     Defendant, directly and indirectly, made use of the means and instrumentalities of 

interstate commerce and the mails in connection with the transactions, acts and courses of 

business alleged herein, certain of which have occurred within the District of Minnesota. 

       6.     Venue for this action is proper in the District of Minnesota under Section 20(a) of 

the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v(a)] and Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa], 

because certain of the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in this 

Complaint took place in this District and because the defendant resides in and transacts business 

in this District. 

                                               2

       7.     Defendant, unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, may continue to engage 

in the transactions, acts, practices, and course of business alleged herein and in transactions, acts, 

practices, and courses of business of similar purport and object. 

       8.     Defendants conduct took place in connection with the offer, purchase, and/or sale 

of Digi securities. 

                                       DEFENDANT 

       9.     Subramanian Krishnan              , age 58, is a resident of Plymouth, Minnesota.  Krishnan 

served as Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President of Digi from February 9, 1999, until 

his resignation on May 7, 2010.  Krishnan has been licensed as a CPA in Minnesota since 1983.   

                                   RELATED PARTIES 

       10.    Digi International, Inc., is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Minnetonka, 

Minnesota.  At all relevant times, Digis common stock was registered with the Commission 

pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act and traded on the NASDAQ.  Digi manufactures 

device networking products for businesses. 

                                 STATEMENT OF FACTS 

       11.    Krishnan became the CFO of Digi on February 9, 1999, and resigned on May 7, 

2010.  Prior to his resignation, Digi conducted an internal audit and forensic accounting 

examination which concluded that Krishnan failed to properly devise, maintain and abide by a 

system of internal controls, which resulted in approval of expense reports that were inconsistent 

with Digi policies and payments for employees that were personal in nature.                                                                       

       12.    As CFO of Digi, Krishnans responsibilities included providing documents and 

information to Digis outside auditor to enable the auditor to certify Digis financial statements, 

                                              3

      CASE 0:12-cv-02495-PAM-JJG   Document 1   Filed 09/28/12   Page 4 of 14

providing management representations to the auditor, implementing internal accounting controls 

for each Digi office and implementing Digis travel and entertainment policy.  

       13.    Beginning in at least March 2005 through May 7, 2010 (the relevant time 

period), Krishnan engaged in a course of conduct in which Digi corporate funds were  used to 

pay for unauthorized personal expenses for Digi employees.   

       14.    During the relevant time period, Krishnan approved corporate travel and 

entertainment expenses which appeared to have marginal, if any, business purpose.  

       15.    Krishnan maintained a system of internal controls that allowed for hotel and 

entertainment expenses to be submitted to and paid by the Asia Pacific Regional office, which 

was located in Hong Kong.  This practice resulted in Krishnans hotel and entertainment 

expenses not being approved by the CEO as required by company policy.  Instead, as CFO, 

Krishnan had authorization and the final approval for all of those expenses.  As a result, 

Krishnan reviewed and approved his own expense reports which included unauthorized 

expenses. 

       16.    By doing so, Krishnan demonstrated a lack of management integrity.  This was a 

material weakness in Digis internal controls over financial reporting. 

       17.    For over five years, Krishnan submitted or approved expense reports which 

included charges for employees personal expenses.  Krishnan personally authorized these 

payments as work and travel expenses.   

       18.    Krishnan also approved cash payments in the Hong Kong office    which were not 

supported by documentation or explanation.    

                                              4

      CASE 0:12-cv-02495-PAM-JJG   Document 1   Filed 09/28/12   Page 5 of 14

       19.    Krishnan knew   or should have known that such unsupported, personal expenses 

violated Digis travel and entertainment policy because Krishnan personally drafted, authorized 

and approved Digis policy. 

       20.    Krishnan, as CFO, was responsible for supervising Digis accounting and finance 

operations.  Krishnan signed Digis public filings, prepared Digis financial statements and 

reviewed both to determine the accuracy and completeness of Digis financial disclosures.   

       21.    Krishnan also represented in Digis Commission filings that he had assessed the 

effectiveness of Digis internal control over financial reporting and concluded that internal 

control over financial reporting was effective.   

       22.    This representation was untrue, as Digis internal control over financial reporting 

was not effective. 

       23.    As CFO, Krishnan was also responsible for providing information to Digis 

outside auditor including, among other things, (1) responding to quarterly inquiries regarding the 

existence and risk of fraud, and (2) signing management representations indicating that 

management was not aware of any fraud.   

       24.    Beginning in March 2005 and ending in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, the 

outside auditor made specific inquiries of Krishnan regarding his knowledge of any fraud.  

Krishnan represented to the outside auditor that he had no knowledge of any fraud. 

       25.    Krishnan also signed approximately 20 management representation letters 

asserting that he had no knowledge of fraud or suspected fraud affecting the company involving 

management [or] employees who have significant roles in internal controls over financial 

reporting.   

                                               5

      CASE 0:12-cv-02495-PAM-JJG   Document 1   Filed 09/28/12   Page 6 of 14

       26.    Krishnans representations were untrue as Krishnan knew or should have known 

of the inaccurate expense reports that he approved and that Digis internal control over financial 

reporting was not effective. 

       27.    Krishnan signed inaccurate Forms 10-K and Forms 10-Q on behalf of Digi, as 

well as materially misrepresented his assessment of the effectiveness of Digis internal controls 

in the corresponding certifications, from March 2005 through May 7, 2010. 

       28.    Krishnans misrepresentations and omissions were material. 

                                FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 
           Violations of Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77q (a)(1)]  

       29.    The Commission realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations contained 

in Paragraphs 1 through 28, above. 

       30.    Krishnan, by engaging in conduct described above, directly or indirectly, in the 

offer or sale of securities, by the use of the means or instruments of transportation or 

communication in interstate commerce or by use of the mails, with scienter, employed devices, 

schemes, or artifices to defraud.  

       31.    By reason of the foregoing, Krishnan, directly or indirectly, violated, and unless 

restrained and enjoined by this Court, will continue to violate, Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities 

Act. 

                               SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION 
     Violations of Section 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)(2), (3)]  

       32.    The Commission realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations contained 

in Paragraphs 1 through 28, above. 

       33.    Krishnan, by engaging in the conduct described above, directly and indirectly, in 

the offer and sale of securities, by the use of the means or instruments of transportation or 

communication in interstate commerce or by use of the mails, obtained money or property by 

                                               6

means of untrue statements of material fact or by omitting to state a material fact necessary in 

order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, 

not misleading, and engaged in transactions, practices, or courses of business which operate or 

would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the purchaser. 

       34.    By reason of the foregoing, Krishnan, directly or indirectly, violated, and unless 

restrained and enjoined will continue to violate, Section 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities 

Act. 

                                THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION 
                   Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and

       35.    The Commission realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations contained 

in Paragraphs 1 through 28, above. 

       36.    Krishnan, by engaging in conduct described in Paragraphs 1 through 28, above, 

directly or indirectly, in connection with the purchase and sale of securities, by the use of means 

or instrumentalities of interstate commerce or of the mails, with scienter: (1) employed devices, 

schemes or artifices to defraud; (2) made untrue statements of material facts or omitted to state 

material facts necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances 

under which they were made, not misleading; or (3) engaged in acts, practices or courses of 

business which operated or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon other persons.  

       37.    By reason of the foregoing, Krishnan, directly or indirectly, violated, and unless 

restrained and enjoined by this Court, will continue to violate Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act 

[15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b- 5].

       38.    The Commission realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations contained 

in Paragraphs 1 through 28, above. 

       39.    Krishnan, by engaging in the conduct described in Paragraphs 1 through 28,

Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and any amendments thereto, and accompanying

       40.    By reason of the foregoing, Krishnan, directly or indirectly, aided and abetted 

violations and, unless restrained and enjoined, will continue to aid and abet violations of Section 

13(a) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78m(a)] and Rules 12b- 20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder
