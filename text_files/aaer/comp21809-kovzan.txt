STEPHEN   M.  KOVZAN,                            JURY  TRIAL   REQUESTED

                                Defendant.

                                    COMPLAINT

      PlaintiffSecurities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") alleges as follows:

                                     SUMMARY

      1.     This case involves fraud and other misconduct by defendantStephen M. Kovzan,

the current Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") and former Chief Accounting Officer ("CAO")of

NIC Inc. ("NIC" or the "Company"), a publicly-traded Kansas technology services company.

Kovzan, as CAO and a member ofNIC's  disclosure committee, prepared,reviewed, and signed

public filings NIC made with the Commission from 2002 to 2006 that concealed the paymentof

more than $1.18 millionin perquisitesto Jeffrey Fraser,NIC'sthen-ChiefExecutive Officer

("CEO") and Chairman ofNIC's Board of Directors. Kovzan knew, or was reckless in not

knowing, thatNIC'sproxy statements,annual reports, and registration statements filed with the

Commissionwere materiallyfalse and misleading because they failed to disclose perquisites

Fraser received from NIC from 2002 through 2005 and falsely represented that Fraser worked for

little to no compensation. Kovzan also knew, or was reckless in not knowing, thatNIC'sfilings

       Case 2:11-cv-02017-JWL -KGS   Document 1     Filed 01/12/11   Page 2 of 28     

with the Commission materially understated the perquisites Fraser received from the company in

2006.

       2.     Beginning in at least 2002, Kovzan received documents and other information

that indicated that NIC was paying for Fraser's personal expenses. Kovzan was repeatedly

informed ofproblems with Fraser's requests for expense reimbursement, such as Fraser's failure

to submit receipts or documentation supporting his reimbursement requests, but Kovzan failed to

address the problems. Even though Kovzan knew Fraser was not submitting receipts or

documentation supporting a business purpose for his expenses as required by NIC policy,

Kovzan instructed his staff inNIC'sfinance department to pay Fraser's expenses. As a resultof

Kovzan's actions, NIC paid for more than one million dollarsofFraser' s personal expenses,

providing Fraser with significant undisclosed compensation in the formofperquisites.

       3.     Fraser's undisclosed perquisites included payments for two homes; hunting

expenses; vacations for Fraser, his girlfriend and his family; flight training; clothing; spa

treatments; personal computers and electronics; health club memberships; a luxury car; and costs

for Fraser to commute by private aircraft from his home in Wyoming to his office atNIC's

Kansas headquarters.

       4.'    Kovzan had responsibility for implementing NIC's internal controls and policies

and for ensuring thatNIC'sbooks, records, and accounts accurately reflected its transactions and

dispositionofassets. Beginning in at least 2002, Kovzan knew, or was reckless in not knowing,

that Fraser's expenses were falsely characterizedasbusiness expenses inNIC'sbooks and

records, when those expenses should have been recorded and disclosed as compensation.

Kovzan also circumvented  NIC's internal controls and policies by authorizingNIC'spayment of

Fraser's personal expenses that lacked documentationofa business purpose. Kovzan's failure to

                                              2

exercise control overNIC'sassets, report Fraser's misconduct toNIC'sAudit Committee, and

disclose Fraser's compensation inNIC's public filings violatedNIC'sinternal controls and

policies. Kovzan also made false representations toNIC'sindependent auditors and failed to

inform the independent auditorsofFraser's expense reporting failures.

       5.     Kovzan personally profited from the wrongdoing alleged in this Complaint by,

among other things, selling his sharesofNICstock while NIC's public filings contained

materially false and misleading statements and omissions.

       6.     Defendant Kovzan, as a resultof the conduct described in this Complaint, has

engaged in, and unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, will in the future engage in

transactions, acts, practices, and coursesofbusiness that violate the anti-fraud provisionsof

Section 17(a)ofthe Securities Actof 1933 ("Securities Act")[15U.S.C. § 77q(a)], Section 10(b)

ofthe Securities Exchange Act of1934 ("Exchange Act")  [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)], and Exchange

       7.     The Commission brings this action pursuant to the authority conferred upon it by

Section 22(a)ofthe Securities Act[15 U.S.C. § 77v(a)] and Sections 2I(d) and (e)ofthe

During the relevant period,NIC'sAssistant Controller reported directly to Kovzan, as NIC did
                      .
not have a Controller. Kovzan was licensed to practice as a CPA in Missouristarting in or about

1994, and in Kansas starting in or about 1996, but these licenses have lapsed. Kovzan's

accounting certificate status in Kansas is currentlyactive. From approximately 1994 until 1999,

Kovzan worked at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and audited the books and recordsofNIC

before the Company went public in 1999.

                        RELATED INDIVIDUAL AND ENTITY

       15.   Jeffery S.Fraser, age 51, a residentofTeton Village, Wyoming, is oneofNIC's

founders. He was CEO  ofNIC  and its predecessor, Kansas Information Consortium, Inc., from

January 1992 to November 1999. He later served asNIC's CEO from May 2002 until February

2008. Fraser was Chairman ofNIC's  Board of Directors ("Board") from the company's

formation until May 2008, and a Board memberuntil September 2009.

       16.   NIC  Inc., a Delaware corporation based in Olathe, Kansas, develops and manages

web sites, online services, and secure payment processing systems for state, local, and federal

government agencies. At all relevant times,NIC'scommon stock was registered under Section

12of the Exchange Act. NIC's commonstock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market

under the symbol "EGOV."

                                       Background

       17.   From at least 2002 through 2007, NIC, a public company, was required to file

certain documents with the Commission including annual reports on Forms 10-K, proxy

statementsand registration statements. NIC incorporatedbyreference certain information

regarding executive compensation from its proxy statementsinto its Forms 10-K for the years

                                            5

2002 through 2006. NIC incorporated it.sproxy statements, and annual reports into its

registration statements filed during the period from 2002 through 2007.

       18.    As NIC's CAO and a member    ofNIC's  disclosure committee, Kovzan played a

significant role in preparing and reviewing the annual reports, proxy statements and registration

statements NIC filed with the Commission. Kovzan reviewed and provided input intoNIC's

proxy statements covering the years 2002 through 2006. He was responsible for preparing the

executive compensation disclosures inNIC's proxy statements. Kovzan also signed, reviewed

and helped to prepareNIC's 2002 through 2006 annual reports, which incorporatedNIC's proxy

statements. Kovzan reviewed and signed NIC's  registration statements on Form S-8/A filed with

the Commission on May 10,2004; Form S-3 filed with the Commission on October 14,2005;

Form S-8 filed with the Commission on July 25,2006; and tw9 Forms S-8 filed with the

Commission on November    20,2006, which incorporated NIC's annual reports and proxy

statements.  Additionally, Kovzan was the key NIC contact withNIC'sindependent auditors and

signedNIC's  management representation letters to its independent auditors from at least 2002

through 2007.

       19.    In addition to participating in the preparation and reviewofNIC'spublic filings

with the Commission, Kovzan was also responsible for managing, among other things,NIC's

finance department, internal controls, taxes, budgeting and forecasting.

       20.    Public companies, such as NIC, are required to furnish information required by

Item 402 ofRegulation S-K on Form 10K in their annual reports and proxy statements. Among

other things, Item 402 requires disclosureofthe compensation, including perquisites,ofthe

company's principal executive officer. For the time period when Fraser served asNIC'sCEO, .

NIC was required to report Fraser's total compensation, including perquisites, in its Forms lO-K

                                             6

and proxy statements. Kovzan was aware  of SEC rules requiring disclosureof perquisites for the

CEO in proxy statements and annual reports.

       21.    From at least 2002 through 2006, Fraser received undisclosed compensation

totaling more than $1.18 million in perquisites. These undisclosed perquisites to Fraser included,

among other things: (i) over $4,000 per month to live in a ski lodge in Wyoming; (ii) monthly

cash payments to Fraser for purported rent for a Kansas house owned by an entity Fraser set up

and controlled; (iii) vacations for Fraser, his girlfriend and his family; (iv) Fraser's flight

training, hunting, spa, skiing, and health club expenses; (v) computers and electronics for Fraser

and his family; (vi) a leased Lexus SUV; (vii) costs for Fraser to commute by private aircraft

from his home in Wyoming to his office atNIC's  Kansas headquarters; and (viii) other daily

living expenses such as groceries, liquor, tobacco, nutritional supplements, and clothing.

       22.    NIC's policies required, among other things, that all NIC employees submit

proper documentation of business purpose for expenses over $10. NIC's Code  of Business

Conduct and Ethics ("Code  ofEthics"), which was posted on NIC's web site and referenced in

NIC's proxy statement, required NIC officers and employees to use corporate credit cards solely

for business purposes and to keep accurate recordsoffunds spent. From at least 2002 until 2007,

Fraser violatedNIC's policies and Code ofEthics by using his corporate credit card for personal

expenses and by failing to submit proper documentation for expenses exceeding $10. Kovzan

also violated the CodeofEthics when he failed to abideby its provisions that he, as CAO,

among other things, ensure full disclosureinfilings with the Commission and achieve

responsible useof and control overNIC's assets.

                    Kovzan's Role in Fraser's Undisclosed Perquisites

       23.    Throughout the relevant time period, Kovzan authorized and directed NIC to pay

Fraser's expenses, which included more than one million dollarsofpersonal expenses.

       24.    Beginning in at least mid-2003, Kovzan received documents and other

information showing that NIC was paying for Fraser's personal expenses. For example, Kovzan

received analysesofFraser's credit card charges prepared byNIC'sAssistant Controller;

Fraser's proposed budgets; and monthly consolidated income statements for the executive

department that included personal expenses for Fraser, such as reimbursements for housing,

moving expenses, a gun vault, toys, ski lift tickets, gym memberships, vitamin supplements, and

other perquisites. In addition, in 2005, Kovzan learned: (i) thatNIC'sCompensation Committee

approved leasing a luxury car for Fraser, and (ii) that NIC was making direct payments to

vendors for utilities at a home in Kansas where Fraser stayed.

       25~    Kovzan knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that each month NIC paid Fraser's

credit card charges in full before receiving Fraser's monthly expense voucher and supporting

documentation. Sometime after NIC paid his credit card charges, Fraser would submit his

monthly expense voucher without any receipts or other documentationofbusiness purpose. On

his monthly expense vouchers, Fraser routinely failed to identify manyofhis personal credit card

charges. Of the credit card charges Fraser identified as personal, he repaid some, but avoided

reimbursing NIC for others by offsetting them against purported "out'-of-pocket" expenses.

Fraser claimed he paid these alleged "out-of-pocket" expenses in cash, but provided no

documentation to NIC to prove that that the expenses had indeed been incurred or that they were

business related.

       26.    From at least 2003,NIC's Assistant Controller alerted Kovzan that he was

suspiciousof Fraser's expense reimbursement requests because Fraser often claimed round

amounts for his undocumented "out-of-pocket" expenses. Even after learningof the Assistant

Controller's suspicions, Kovzan circumventedNIC's  policies and internal controls by

authorizing and directing the Assistant Controller to pay Fraser's purported "out-of-pocket"

expenses. During the relevant time period, Fraser received NIC checks bearing Kovzan's

signature for reimbursementof the purported "outofpocket" expenses.

       27.    On several occasions,NIC's Assistant Controller also notified Kovzan about

problems with, and concerns about, Fraser's corporate credit card charges. On or about October

2,2003, the Assistant Controller sent Kovzan an email containing a list and analysisofFraser's

expenses, which showed that Fraser's undocumented credit card charges for the first eight

months of2003 totaled over $140,000. The Assistant Controller highlighted the expenses that

Fraser had not repaid, including a numberofpersonal expenses. The Assistant Controller

warned Kovzan that "[a] number  ofthese credit card and other expenses would completely flame

employees, our customers, the board, and investorsifthey were aware. Hopefully, noneof this

is selected for audit and Iwon'thave to explain the business purpose for these items." The

Assistant Controller suggested NIC "eliminate the personal credit card expenses" and instead

give Fraser "pay for perfonnance." Kovzan knew these steps were not taken.

       28.    On or about June 28, 2005, Kovzan received an email from NIC's Assistant

Controller attaching a spreadsheetofFraser's April 2005 and May 2005 credit card expenses on

which the Assistant Controller indicated he had questions about the business purpose for a

number  ofthese expenses, including tanning salon expenses, wilderness vacation expenses, and

clothing purchases.

       29.    On or about November 9, 2005, Kovzan received an email from  NIC's Assistant

Controller with the subject line "Credit Card receipt enforcement." The Assistant Controller

warned Kovzan that one ofthe "key points to be aware of," was that Fraser does not include any

receipts with his signed credit card statements. The Assistant Controller expressed concern that

"this could get us in trouble down the road by not having this support for the expenditures."

       30.    On or about June 2, 2004, Kovzan discussed in emails withNIC's then-CFO the

need to improve internal controls over Fraser's expense reporting in order to comply with

internal controls requirementsofSection 404of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of2002.  NIC's then­

CFO expressed concerns to Kovzan after reviewing some  ofFraser's expense vouchers. In

Kovzan's response email, he noted thatNIC's policies required: (i) receipts for all cash

expenditures in excessof$1 0.00 and for expenses related to air travel, hotel, car rental, meals,

entertainment, tolls, parking, and cab fares; and (ii) documentation for each expense describing

such things as the business purpose, who was present, and the place.

       31.    Despite the documents and information he received fromNIC's  Assistant

Controller, and his knowledgeofNIC's  policies concerning expense reimbursements, Kovzan

repeatedly circumvented NIC's policies and internal controls by authorizing and directingNIC's

finance department to pay Fraser's credit card expenses. Kovzan knew,orwas reckless in not

knowing, that Fraser was usingNIC's corporate credit cards for personal expenses, and that

Fraser failed to provide receipts or other documentation supporting a business purpose forhis·

credit card expenses.

       32.    In addition to paying for Fraser's personal credit card charges and living

expenses, Kovzan also knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that from at least 2002 through

2006, NIC paid Fraser for his commuting expenses to travel between his Wyoming home and

                                             10

Kansas office. Kovzan knew that: (i) Fraser resided in Wyoming and had a dedicated office at

NIC's headquarters in Kansas; (ii) there was no business reason for Fraser to reside in Wyoming;

and (iii) the personal benefits Fraser received -- private plane and other expenses to travel from

his home to his office -- were not generally available to other NIC employees.

       33.    In January 2004,NIC's Assistant Controller warned Kovzan that for tax purposes,

there was a risk that Fraser's private plane travel from his Wyoming home to his Kansas office at

NIC's headquarters could be deemed to be a commuting cost, which would be a personal

expense and therefore compensation to Fraser. The Assistant Controller explained that he did

not have sufficient information to determine Fraser's main placeofwork and they would need to

perform an analysisofFraser's business activity for one year. Kovzan, however, did not require

this analysis be performed, and it never was done. Accordingly, Kovzan had no reasonable basis

to treat Fraser's commuting cost as a business expense insteadofcompensation.

       34.    NIC's Board or its committees approved many ofFraser's travel and other

expenses based on information that Kovzan and others in the finance department compiled.

       35.    In March 2005, in connection with preparing the compensation disclosures for the

2004 proxy statement,NIC's Audit Committee Chairman, who also served as  NIC's

Compensation Committee Chairman (the "Committee Chairman"), expressed to Kovzan that

Fraser's expenses for traveling between Wyoming and Kansas may not be deductible business

expenses and may need to be disclosed as compensation to Fraser. The Committee Chairman

told Kovzan that he would defer to Kovzan on the issue as long as the required documents were

being maintained. Kovzan failed to inform the Committee Chairman that no analysis had been

performed to supportNIC's treatment ofthese travel expenses as business expenses and NIC was

                                            11

not retaining sufficient documentation. Kovzan failed to disclose Fraser's commuting costs as a

perquisite in anyofNIC's proxy statements.

       36.    Kovzan was repeatedly informed of actual and potential problems with Fraser's

expenses, but Kovzan failed to tellNIC'sAudit Committee or its independent auditors about any

ofthe problems. Although Kovzan had the authority to direct his staff to stop paying Fraser's

expenses without proper documentation, he failed todoso. Instead, Kovzan continued to

authorizeNIC's payment  ofFraser's undocumented expenses, including personal expenses.

Kovzan also failed to disclose Fraser's personal expenses as perquisites in NIC's filings with the

Commission.

                  Kovzan's  Misconduct  Continued  After the 'Commission
                  Proposed New Executive Compensation Rules in 2006

       37.    After the Commission proposed new executive compensation rules in early 2006,

NIC's Assistant Controller warnedNIC's then-Chief Operating Officer in an April 18, 2006

email about the riskofpossible income tax fraud charges against Fraser and NIC because Fraser

had not submitted any documentation ofbusiness purpose for his corporate credit card charges.

Shortly thereafter, Kovzan discussed in emails with NIC's then-CFO the possibility that

someone might become a whistleblower.

       38.    On about April 30, 2006,NIC's then-CFO sought comments from Kovzan on an

email he was dfafting toNIC'sthen-Chief Operating Officer regarding the magnitude and

severityofFraser's expense reporting failures. Among other things, the draft email noted that:

              a.     Fraser had not submitted any receipts or indicated the business purposeof

                     any ofhis credit card charges for 2005 and the first quarterof2006and

                     there were over 1,200 charges in that time period which would require a

                     receipt under NIC policies;

                                             12

        b.     Fraser charged over $26,000 at three different home/furniture stores and

               there were "NUMEROUS other examples"      of suspicious expenses;

        c.     Fraser usually charged a flat dollar amount each month for "out-of­

               pocket" expenses without any receipts orexplanation;

        d.     a portionof Fraser's aircraft-related expenses were personal;

        e.     NIC paid personal expenses for Fraser: (i) without approvalofNIC's

               compensation and/or Audit Committees; (ii) without taking into account

               the tax consequences to Fraseror NIC; and (iii) without NIC reporting

               these expenses as perquisites;

        f.     NIC had  not disclosed anyof Fraser's perquisitesinNIC's  2005 proxy

               statement;

        g.     There was a risk ofCommission enforcement action based on   NIC's

               deficient internal controls over perquisites, noting that in 2005, the

               Commission brought an enforcement action against Tyson Foods "because

               their systemof internal controls did not report allofthe perks to the Comp

               Committee";

        h.     employees "feel that [Fraser] appears to be rippingoffthe company and is

               not required to follow the same rules that everyone else (including the

               execs) has to follow";

        1.     this was not"a going forward only matter - the 2005 expenses need[ed] to

               be dealt with"; and

        J.     NIC's  Board and Compensation Committee would be making decisions

               without "full disclosure" from management, "particularly in viewof the

                                       13

                     Financial Officer CodeofEthics."

       40.    In mid-2006, NIC adopted additional procedures regarding executive expense

reporting, but those procedures were not sufficient to fully remedy the problems with Fraser's

perquisites, and Fraser continued receiving undisclosed perquisites.

       41.    For example, on about August 4,2006, NIC's Compensation Committee directed

that to the extent Fraser's 2006 expenses lacked documentationofbusiness purpose and/or failed

to comply withNIC's  expense reimbursement policy, the expenses would be treated as

compensation to Fraser. Contrary to that directive, Kovzan and others allowed Fraser to create

documentation of a business purpose after the fact for someofhis 2006 expenses and reimburse

NIC for certain other 2006 expenses.

       47.    Fraser did reimburse NIC a total of$110,000 for certain 2006 personal expenses

he had charged to NIC as business expenses, but failed to reimburse NIC for a numberofother

2006 personal expenses. Kovzan, who was the primary contact with NIC's independent auditors,

did not inform them that Fraser made this $110,000 repayment orofany improprieties with

Fraser's expense reporting. The independent auditors were not informedofany issues with

Fraser's expense reporting until after NIC learned in mid-2007ofthe Commissionstaffs

investigationoffacts surrounding Fraser's receiptofundisclosed perquisites.

       48.    Additionally, duringNIC's review ofFraser's 2006 expenses, Kovzan and other

high-level executives decided it was not worth the effort to have Fraser review and repay any

expenses from previous periods even though they discussed that Fraser had not been submitting

documentation of business purpose for his expenses since 2002 and the amountsofFraser's

improper personal expenses likely were comparable each year. Kovzan ignoredNIC's  Assistant

                                            14

Controller suggestion in an August 18, 2006 email to Kovzan thatifthey could not obtain

receipts for Fraser's earlier expenses, they should estimate Fraser's personal expenses by

applying the percentageofFraser's 2006 expenses that were personal to Fraser's 2004 and 2005

expenses and that these amounts should be considered compensation to Fraser.

         49.  On about September 26,2006,   NIC's then-CFO forwarded an email to Kovzan in

which NIC's Assistant Controller voiced strong concerns about ignoring the past problems with

Fraser's expense reporting: "[Fraser] spent a crap load over the last three years and the company

has little to show for it. Now we're spinning it or sticking [our] heads in the sand about the

history...[A]s a management team it appears thatwe're going to whitewash the historical

issue."

       50.    Kovzan ignored  NIC's Assistant Controller's warning, did not address the pre-

2006 problems with Fraser's expenses.,and failed to informNIC'sindependent auditors of

Fraser's expense reporting failures.

       51.    Disclosing Fraser's misconduct publicly could have adversely impactedNIC's

business because some ofNIC's  business contracts provided that the customers could terminate

the contracts for fraud or illegal conduct by NIC, its officers, or its directors.

       52.    Kovzan also failed to remedy Fraser's expense reporting problems after 2006.

Fraser continued to receive more than $100,000of undisclosed perquisites in 2007, such as

custom clothing, personal electronics, spa services for him and his girlfriend, and gym

memberships. Kovzan failed to maintain proper internal controls over Fraser's expense

reporting and failed to ensure that these perquisites were properly recorded as compensation to

Fraser in the Company's books, records and accounts.

 Kovzan Co..cealed Fraser's Perquisites and NIC Executives' Violations  ofNIC's  Code  of
      Ethics in NIC's Filings with the Commission for the Years 2002 through 2006

       53.   Based on the facts alleged herein, Kovzan knew, or was reckless in not knowing,

thatNIC's annual reports on Forms 10-K for 2002 through 2006 that Kovzan signed and

reviewed, the related proxy statements that Kovzan reviewed and helped to draft, and the

relevant registration statements that Kovzan signed and reviewed, were materially false and

misleading because these filings: (i) failed to disclose anyofFraser's perquisites from 2002 to

2005; (ii) falsely represented that Fraser received only nominal compensation from 2002 to

2005; and (iii) materially understated Fraser's perquisites in 2006.

       54.    The amount of Fraser's compensation that NICdisclosed in its public filings with

the Commission from 2002 through 2006, and the amount of Fraser's undisclosed perquisites,

are summarized below:

         Year      Disclosed    Disclosed       Disclosed  Undisclosed perquisites

                      Salary       Bonus       perquisites

         2002              $1           --              --        More than $90,000

         2003              $1           --              --       More than $300,000

         2005         $5,500            --              --       More than $400,000
         2006       $218,500     $110,000        $272,681         More than $60,000

       55.    Kovzan also knew, or was reckless in not knowing, thatNIC'sproxy statements

for 2003 through 2006 were false and misleading because NIC referred to its CodeofEthics as a

means to promote shareholder confidence in NIC and its management, but failed to disclose that

Kovzan and other NIC executives were violating that CodeofEthics. Among other things,

NIC's proxy statements failed to disclose:

                     included in all public documents; (iv) informNIC'sindependent auditors

                     ofmaterial misstatements and omissions regarding Fraser's compensation

                     inNIC's  proxy statements and annual reports; and (v) report Fraser's

                     cards for personal expenses, failing to document the business purpose for

                     his expenses, and failing to keep accurate recordsoffunds spent; and

              c.     That NIC's then-CFO failed to ensure Fraser's perquisites were disclosed

                     in Commission filings, failed to achieve responsible use and controlof

                     NIC's assets within his purview and failed to maintain controls over

       56..   Kovzan provided substantial assistance to NIC in its reporting and proxy

violations by helping to draft, review and/or signNIC'sannual reports and proxy statements.

Kovzan knew, or was reckless in not knowing, thatNIC's annual reports and proxy statements

for the years 2002 through 2006 were materially false and misleading, in part because they failed

to disclose Fraser's perquisites.

       57.    Kovzan also knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that Fraser's personal

expenses were falsely characterized as business expenses inNIC'sbooks and records, including

NIC's general ledger and the internal financial statements forNIC'sexecutive department, when

those expenses should have been recorded, characterized, classified and disclosed as executive

compensation.

       58.    Kovzan had responsibility forNIC's  accounting controls and the recording and

classificationofexpenses inNIC's  books and records. Kovzan provided substantial assistance to

NIC in its internal controls and books and records violations by: (i) failing to accurately report

Fraser's compensation, (ii) failing to enforceNIC'spolicies by instructing his accounting staff to

process Fraser's undocumented expense requests, (iii) allowing Fraser to use the corporate credit

card for personal charges, and (iv) failing to informNIC'sAudit Committee and its independent

auditors about these problems.

           Kovzan Made False Representations to NIC's Independent Auditors

       59.    Kovzan made numerous false representations to NIC's  independent auditors. For

example, Kovzan signed management representation letters to NIC's independent auditors in

connection with their annual auditsofNIC's financial statements for 2002 to 2006. These letters

were dated on or about March 20,2003; March   8,2004; March 3, 2005; March 14,2006; and

March 13,2007.

       60.    Among other things, Kovzan misrepresented in the March 20, 2003 and March 8,

2004 management representation letters that:

              a.     There were no significant deficiencies in the design or operationof

                     internal controls that could adversely affectNIC'sability to record,

                     process, summarize and report financial data, when Kovzan knew about

                                             18

                     the internal controls deficiencies over Fraser's expense reporting and that

                     Fraser's expenses were falsely characterized as business expenses in

                     NIC's books and records; and

              b.     Kovzan had no knowledge   ofany fraud or suspected fraud affecting NIC

                     management, when Kovzan knew, or was reckless in not knowing,  of his

                     and Fraser's fraudulent conduct.

       61.    Among other things, Kovzan misrepresented in the March 3, 2005; March 14,

2006; and March 13,2007 management representation letters that:

              a.     Kovzan had concluded that NIC maintained effective internal control over

                     financial reporting asofthe endofthe preceding calendar year, when

                     Kovzan knew about the internal controls deficiencies over Fraser's

                     expense reporting;

              b.     Kovzan had disclosed to NIC's independent auditors all deficiencies in the

                     design or operationofinternal controls over financial reporting (whether

                     or not remediated) as partofhis assessmentofthe effectivenessofinternal

                     controls over financial reporting asofthe endofthe preceding calendar

                     year, when Kovzan had not disclosed any deficiencies with respect to

                     Fraser's expense reporting andNIC's reportingof Fraser's compensation

                     in its filings with the Commission; and

              c.     Except for a matter at oneofNIC's subsidiaries in 2004, Kovzan had no

                     knowledge  ofany fraud or suspected fraud affecting NIC involving senior

                     management, when Kovzan had knowledge     ofhis own and Fraser's

                     fraudulent conduct.

       62.    In the March 13,2007 management representation letter, Kovzan also

misrepresented that he had no knowledgeofany allegationsof fraud or suspected fraud affecting

NIC received in communications from employees, even though Kovzan had received an email

from NIC's then-CFO, dated April 30, 2006, stating that Fraser "appears to be rippingoffthe

Company."

       63.    Kovzan also signed a November 20,2006, management representation letter to

NIC's auditors issued in connection with the registration statements filed on that day, falsely

stating that no information had come to his attention that would cause him to believe the

representations he made in the March14,2006 management representation letter regarding

NIC's internal controls over financial reporting asofDecember 31,2005, should be modified. In

fact, after signing the March14,2006management representation letter, Kovzan received an

email fromNIC's  then-CFO, dated May  1,2006, in which the then-CFO detailed the magnitude

and severityofFraser's expense reporting failures in 2005. When Kovzan signed the November

20, 2006 management representation letter, he knew that Fraser had repaid NIC approximately

$110,000 for personal expenses that he had charged to NIC in 2006 as business expenses.

Kovzan also discussed with other executives that the amountofpersonal expenses Fraser had

received in prior years was likely comparable.

    NIC's Stock Price Dropped After NIC's First Disclosure  of Fraser's Expense Issues

       66.    On February 6,2008, NIC announced Fraser's retirement and disclosed for the

first time that there had been issues concerning Fraser's expense reporting. In a Form 8-K, NIC

disclosed that Fraser had reimbursed NIC $283,000 for expenses that were not consistent with

the Company's expense reimbursement policy. However, the Form 8-K was misleading because

                                            20

it purported to disclose the resultsofan internal reviewofFraser's expenses, but failed to

disclose that the review concluded that Fraser had intentionally misclassified his expenses.

       67.    In the three daysoftrading after this limited disclosure,NIC'sstock price

dropped a totalofapproximately 16%.

                     Kovzan Personally Benefited from His Misconduct

       68.    Kovzan personally profited from the misconduct described in this Complaint by,

among other things, selling more than110,000  sharesofNIC   stock from at least November 2003

through May 2008 obtaining profits of approximately $300,000, while NIC's  materially false and

misleading public filings were in the marketplace. In addition, someofKovzan' s shares were

the subjectof NIC's false and misleading registration statements that he reviewed and signed.

Kovzan also benefitted from his misconduct by receiving a promotion to become  NIC's CFO in

August 2007.
