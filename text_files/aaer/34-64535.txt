Respondent.                                     IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS  
 
 
 
 
  
                                              I. 
 
              The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) deems it appropriate and in the 
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against John 
Scullin pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(i) of the Commissions Rules of Practice1
                                                                           against John Scullin 
(Scullin or Respondent).   
 
 II. 
 
              In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Scullin has submitted an Offer of 
Settlement (the Offer) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the purpose 
of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the Commission, or to 
which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings herein, except as 

                                                 
1
 Rule 102(e)(3)(i) provides, in relevant part, that:  
 
The Commission, with due regard to the public interest and without preliminary hearing, may, by order, . . . suspend 
from appearing or practicing before it any  professional  who has been by name . . . permanently enjoined by 
any court of competent jurisdiction, by reason of his or her misconduct in an action brought by the Commission, 
from violating or aiding and abetting the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or of the rules and 
regulations thereunder.  
 
---------------------Page 2---------------------

to the Commissions jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these proceedings, and the 
findings contained in Section III.3 below, which are admitted, Scullin consents to the entry of this 
Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commissions Rules 
of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (Order) as set forth below.   
 
                                              III. 
 
              On the basis of this Order and Scullins Offer, the Commission finds that:  
       
       1.     John Scullin, age 51, was the Manager for Project Accounting at Baker Energy, 
Michael Baker Corporations energy segment, from June 2006 through June 2008.  Scullin was 
never licensed to practice as a certified public accountant (CPA), but falsely represented 
himself to Michael Baker management as a CPA licensed to practice in Virginia.   
 

       2.     Michael Baker Corporation is a Pennsylvania corporation headquartered in Moon 
Township, Pennsylvania (Michael Baker or the Company).  Michael Ba   kers business, at the 
time of conduct at issue, was divided into two business segments:  Engineering and Energy.  The 
Engineering division focused on design and consulting services primarily in the United States.  The 
Energy division, Baker Energy, was headquartered in Houston, Texas and focused on the provision 
of oil related services both in the United States and abroad.  Baker Energy typically generated 
roughly 35-40% of the Companys consolidated gross revenues.   
 

       3.     On May 11, 2011, the Commission filed a complaint against Scullin in SEC v. 
Michael Baker Corporation, et al. (Civil Action No. 11-cv-1791).  On May 17, 2011, the court 
entered a final judgment permanently enjoining Scullin, by consent, from future violations of 
Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 
10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) 
and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13.   
 

       4.     In its complaint, the Commission alleged that for the 2006 annual reporting period 
and the first three quarters of 2007, Scullin, who misrepresented himself as CPA to Michael 
Bakers management, willfully engaged in improper accounting practices and aided and abetted 
Michael Bakers fraudulent accounting practices, which resulted in Michael Baker overstating its 
revenue and net income. As a direct result of Scullins actions, the Company overstated its 
consolidated net income by $1.5 million or 15% for 2006 and overstated its consolidated net 
income by $1.5 million or 94%, $2.4 million or 39%, and $1.9 million or 42%, for the first, 
second and third quarters of 2007, respectively.  The overstatements of revenue and net income 
were primarily the result of Scullins improper accounting practices, which he knew or should 
have known were improper.

               In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
impose the sanction agreed to in Scullins Offer. 
 
               Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that Scullin is suspended 
from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant pursuant to Rule 
102(e)(3)(i). 
   
                
 By the Commission.
