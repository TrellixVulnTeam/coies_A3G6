      CSK AUTO CORPORATION,                   ACT OF 1934, GRANTING WAIVERS OF 
                                              THE DISQUALIFICATION PROVISIONS OF 
Respondent.                                   SECTION 27A(b)(1)(A)(ii) OF THE 
                                              SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND SECTION

              OReilly Automotive, Inc. (OReilly) has submitted a letter, dated April 8, 2009, for a 
waiver of the disqualification provisions of Section 27A(b)(1)(A)(ii) of the Securities Act of 1933 
(Securities Act) and Section 21E(b)(1)(A)(ii) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(Exchange Act) arising from CSK Auto Corporations (CSK) offer to settle to a cease-and-
desist order.  CSK is a wholly-owned subsidiary of OReilly.  On May 26, 2009, the Commission 
issued a cease-and-desist order against CSK.  In the order, the Commission alleged that CSK 
violated (among other provisions) Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the 
Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, CSK 
consented to cease and desist from committing future violations of these (and other) provisions (the 
Cease-and-Desist Order). 
   The safe harbor provisions of Section 27A(c) of the Securities Act and Section 21E(c) of the 
Exchange Act are not available for any forward-looking statement that is made with respect to the 
business or operations of an issuer, if the issuer . . . during the 3-year period preceding the date on 
which the statement was first made . . . has been made the subject of an administrative . . . order 
arising out of a government action that . . . prohibits future violations of the antifraud provisions of 
the federal securities laws.  Section 27A(b)(1)(A)(ii) of the Securities Act and Section  
---------------------Page 2---------------------

21E(b)(1)(A)(ii) of the Exchange Act.  The disqualifications apply except to the extent otherwise 
specifically provided by rule, regulation, or order of the Commission.  Section 27A(b) of the 
Securities Act and Section 21E(b) of the Exchange Act. 
    Because the violations alleged in the Cease-and-Desist Order were committed at CSK before 
OReilly acquired CSK, and because the Cease-and-Desist Order does not involve allegations of 
misconduct by OReilly or require undertakings by or involving OReilly, the Commission has 
determined that OReillys request for a waiver of the disqualifications resulting from the Cease-
and-Desist Order is appropriate and should be granted. 
    Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED, pursuant to Section 27A(b) of the Securities Act and Section 
21E(b) of the Exchange Act, that a waiver from the disqualification provisions of 27A(b)(1)(A)(ii) 
of the Securities Act and Section 21E(b)(1)(A)(ii) of the Exchange Act as to OReilly resulting 
from the entry of the Cease-and-Desist Order is hereby granted. 
 
 By the Commission.
