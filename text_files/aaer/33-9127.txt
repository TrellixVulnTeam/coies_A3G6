                                         I. 
 
              The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) deems it appropriate and in the 
public interest that public administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, 
instituted pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 21C of 
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Section 203(f) of the Investment 
Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act) against Ephraim Fields (Respondent or Fields).   
                                           
                                         II. 
 
              In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the Offer) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the 
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings 
herein, except as to the Commissions jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these 
 
 
---------------------Page 2---------------------

proceedings, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting 
Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Sec   tion 8A of the Securities Act of 
1933, Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Section 203(f) of the Investment 
Advisers Act of 1940,  Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-
Desist Order (Order), as set forth below.   
 
                                               III. 
 
              On the basis of this Order and Respondents Offer, the Commission finds1
                                                                                  that  
 
                                         Respondent 
 
        1. Fields,              age 43, resides in New York, New York.  During the relevant period, 
he was the owner and manager of a registered investment adviser, Clarus Capital Management, 
LLC (Clarus Management).  Fields was also the general partner of Clarus Capital, LLC 
(Clarus), an unregistered hedge fund.  
   
                                     Other Relevant Entities 
 
                     2.           Clarus Management, during the relevant period, was a registered investment 
adviser based in New York, New York.  It served as an adviser to Clarus.  On December 23, 2008, 
Clarus Management submitted its Form ADV-W Notice of Withdraw        al From Registration as an 
Investment Adviser, which was approved, and it ceased conducting advisory business. 
        
                     3.           Hawk Corporation (Hawk), a Delaware corporation headquartered in 
Cleveland, Ohio, is a supplier of products used in industrial, agricultural, performance, and 
aerospace applications.  Its common stock is registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 
12(b) of the Exchange Act and is traded on the American Stock Exchange under the symbol HWK. 
    
                                            Background 
 
                     4.           This case involves marking the closing price of Hawks stock to delay the 
requirement that it comply with the internal control provisions promulgated under Section 404 of 
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX 404) in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act.   
                
                     5.           SOX 404 requires management and auditors of public companies to 
annually assess and report on the design and effectiveness of the company  s internal control over 
financial reporting.  After the enactment of SOX 404, the Commission issued a number of 
extensions for non-accelerated filers, including those issuers with worldwide market values of 
                                                 
       1
         The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent's Offer of Settlement and are not binding 
on any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.  

        

 
                                                2

the voting and non-voting common equity held by their non-affiliates of less than $75 million.  A 
September 22, 2005 extension provided that non-accelerated filers did not have to comply with 
the SOX 404 requirements until their first fiscal year ending on or after July 15, 2007.   
 
                  6.            Under the September 22, 2005 extension, Hawk could avoid compliance 
with SOX 404 for its fiscal year ending December 31, 2006, if Hawks worldwide market value 
of the voting and non-voting common equity held by its non-affiliates was less than $75 million 
on the last day of the second quarter of 2006 - June 30, 2006.  If Hawk stayed below the $75 
million threshold, it would remain a non-accelerated filer and have until the end of 2007 to 
comply with SOX 404.  The closing price of Hawks stock on June 30, 2006 would be used to 
determine the market value of the voting and non-voting common equity held by Hawks non-
affiliate shareholders.  On June 30, 2006, the closing price that would have triggered Hawks 
obligation to comply with SOX 404 for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 was $12.30 (the 
trigger price).   
        
                   7.           On June 30, 2006, one of Hawks Corporate Executives called Fields.  In 
that call, the Corporate Executive stated that if Hawks stock closed below the trigger price that 
day, Hawk could avoid compliance with SOX 404 by year-end.  Based on the call, Fields believed 
the Corporate Executive wanted him to make sure that Hawks stock closed below the trigger 
price. 
        
                   8.           Shortly after the call with the Corporate Executive, Fields submitted eight 
limit day orders on behalf of Clarus to sell a total of 40,000 shares of Hawk at $12.29.  This trading 
position was unusually large in light of the fact that the average daily trading volume for Hawk in 
the second quarter was 11,371 shares a day.  Fields placed these orders to artificially cap the 
closing price of Hawk shares below the $12.30 per share trigger price in order to allow Hawk to 
avoid compliance with SOX 404.   
        
                           9.         Only 400 of the 40,000 shares sold before the end of the day on June 30, 
2006.  The sale of these 400 shares was reported as the last trade of that day.  The outstanding offer 
to sell the remaining 39,600 shares at $12.29 was the prevailing offer to sell at the close of trading. 
As a result, Hawks stock price was capped that day at $12.29.  At the end of the day on June 30, 
2006, the remainder of these limit day orders expired.     
 
                            10.        As a result of the conduct described above, Fields willfully violated Section 
17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. 
 
 
                                                  
                                                IV. 
                                                  
        In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
impose the sanctions agreed to in Respondent Fieldss Offer.

made, additional interest shall accrue pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3717.  Such payment shall be: (A)

order; (B) made payable to the Securities and Exchange Commission; (C) hand-delivered or
