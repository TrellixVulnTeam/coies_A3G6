       In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer

              The Commission, with due regard to the public interest and without preliminary hearing, 
       may, by order, . . . suspend from appearing or practicing before it any . . . accountant . . . who has

to Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial 
Sanctions (“Order”), as set forth below. 

                                              III. 

       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that: 

              A.      Sharkey, age 34, was a certified public  accountant in the State of Texas. 
During the relevant tim e period, Sharkey was a m ember of the deal structure group of Dynegy 
Inc. (“Dynegy”), and substantially participat  ed in a Dynegy financing transaction known as 
Project Alpha. 

              B.      Dynegy  is  an  Illinois  corporation headquartered in Hou  ston, Texas . 
Dynegy’s shares are registered with the Comm     ission under Section 12(b) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 and trade on the New York Stock Exchange. 

              C.      On Septe mber 24, 2002, the Comm  ission entered an order by consent 
against Dynegy, on a neither-adm  it-nor-deny basis, resulting from  the com pany’s im proper 
accounting and misleading disclosures relating to Project A lpha.  The Order found that Dynegy 
used Project Alpha to enhance cash flow from operations by $300 million in 2001 and to achieve 
a related $79 million tax benefit.   The Order found that Dynegy failed to disclose properly the 
financing transactions underlying Project Alpha, and failed to clar ify that the cash flow reported 
on its 2001 Statement of Cash Flows derived from financing activities, not operations.  See Order 
Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21C of 
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings and Imposing a Cease-And-Desist Order, 
Admin. File 3-10897 (S ept. 24, 2002).   Dynegy fu rther consented to pay a $3 million civil 
penalty.  SEC v. Dynegy Inc., Civil Action H-02-3623 (S.D. Tex. Sept. 30, 2002). 

              D.      On June 11, 2003, the Comm ission filed a complaint against Sharkey in 
SEC v. Foster et al.  ,  (Civil Ac tion H-03-204 4), in  the  Unite d States District Court for the 
Southern D istrict of  Texas.    The Comm ission’s com plaint alleged  that Shark ey willf ully 
disregarded accounting advice from  Dynegy’s outside auditor on  Project Alpha and concealed 
critical transaction details from the auditor in violation of the federal securities laws. 

              E.      On September 7, 2007, the court entered an order perm anently enjoining 
Sharkey from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b) 
and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder.

accept Respondent’s Offer.
