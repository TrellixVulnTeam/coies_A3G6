Registration Statement of                     :       Of The Division Of

Tsukuda-America Inc.                           :      Considered At A Public 
5I9 East Interstate 30, Suite #248            :       Hearing Pursuant To 
Rockwall, Texas  75087                        :       Section 8(d) Of The 
                                              :       Securities Act Of 1933 
------------------------------------------------------: 
 
                                              I 
                                               
       On or about March 27, 2009, Tsukuda-America Inc. (“Tsukuda”) filed a 
registration statement on Form S-1 with the Commission, and on or about April 10, 2009, 
it filed an amended statement on Form S-1\A.  The registration statement was declared 
effective on April 14, 2009.   The registrati on statement included an audit report on the 
financial statements of Tsukuda purportedly made by Weinberg & Company, P.A. 
(“Weinberg”), an accounting firm in Boca Raton, Florida, and a consent to the inclusion 
of the audit report in the registration statement purportedly signed on behalf of Weinberg.  
The Division of Enforcement alleges that the registration statement included untrue 
statements of material fact and omitted material facts.  The following are the matters to 
be considered at a hearing pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Securities Act of 1933 to 
determine whether a stop order should be issued with respect to the registration 
statement.      
  
                                             II 
                                               
       The registration statement, as originally filed and as amended, includes untrue 
statements of material fact and omits material facts, including but not limited to, the false 
representation that Weinberg audited, and prepared an audit report upon, the financial 
statements of Tsukuda, and that Weinberg consented to the inclusion of the audit report 
in Tsukuda’s registration statement, and the omission to disclose that the audit report and 
consent were not legitimate, in violation of the requirements of the Securities Act and the 
Commission’s forms and regulations governing the offer and sale of securities to the 
public.

       Accordingly, the Division of Enforcement believes that a stop order should be 
issued suspending the effectiveness of Tsukuda’s registration statement, pending its 
correction of these deficiencies.
