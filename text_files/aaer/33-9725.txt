Rules of Practice; and (ii) Timothy W. Carnahan (“Carnahan”) and CYIOS Corporation 
(“CYIOS”) pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) and Section 
21C of the Exchange Act.   

                                               II. 

       After an investigation, the Division of Enforcement and the Office of the Chief Accountant 
allege that: 

       A.     RESPONDENTS 

       1.     Traci J. Anderson, CPA, age 46 and a resident of Charlotte, North Carolina, has 
functioned as a contract CFO to CYIOS Corporation since July 2007.  From 2003 through August 
2010 Anderson was the sole proprietor of a PCAOB-registered public accounting firm and was 
engaged as CYIOS Corporation’s auditor from September 2005 until she resigned in July 2007 to 
become the company’s internal accountant.  Anderson consented to a PCAOB order dated August 
12, 2010 pursuant to which she was barred from being an associated person of a registered public 
accounting firm.  Additionally, Anderson consented in January 2012 to an order pursuant to which 
she forfeited her CPA license in North Carolina.  Anderson remains licensed as a CPA in Florida. 

       2.     Timothy W. Carnahan, age 47 and a resident of Pompano Beach, Florida, is the 
founder and is disclosed as the sole officer and director of CYIOS.  Between 2006 and November 
2012, Carnahan signed and certified each of CYIOS’s periodic filings in the capacities of principal 
executive and principal financial officer. 

       3.     CYIOS Corporation, a Nevada corporation headquartered in Washington D.C., is 
a Department of Defense contractor providing: systems integration; web and database 
development; business process management and improvement; and solutions for compliance with 
Sarbanes-Oxley regulations and Defense Contract Audit Agency and performance-based 
contracting for government contractors.  Its common stock was registered under Section 12(g) of 
the Exchange Act and was traded on the OTC Bulletin Board (Symbol: CYIO).  After receiving a 
letter dated May 12, 2014 from the Commission’s Division of Corporation Finance informing 
CYIOS that it was not in compliance with its reporting requirements under Section 13(a) of the 
Exchange Act, CYIOS filed a Form 15-12G on May 30, 2014 terminating the registration of its 
common stock.    

       B.     ANDERSON WAS UNLAWFULLY ASSOCIATED WITH CYIOS AFTER THE 
              PCAOB BARRED HER FROM ASSOCIATING WITH A REGISTERED 
              PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

       4.     Section 105(c)(7)(B) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley”) states 
that it is “unlawful for any person that is ... barred from being associated with a registered public 
accounting firm [...] willfully to become or remain associated with any issuer […] in an 
accountancy or financial management capacity [...] without the consent of the [PCAOB] or the 

                                                                                                                                                             
              willfully aided and abetted the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or the rules 
              and regulations thereunder. 

                                                2

Commission.”  Section 105(c)(7)(B) also states that it is unlawful for any “issuer […] that knew, or 
in the exercise of reasonable care should have known, of such suspension or bar, to permit such an 
association, without the consent of the Board or the Commission.”   

       5.      On August 12, 2010, the PCAOB filed a settled action against Anderson and her 
firm, Traci Jo Anderson, for multiple deficiencies in audit work performed between 2007 and 2009 
                                                                              3
on public companies engagements unrelated to CYIOS (the “PCAOB Order”).   The PCAOB 
Order, which was and is available on its website, revoked the registration of her accounting firm 
and barred Anderson from being an associated person of a registered public accounting firm.   

       6.      Following the issuance of the PCAOB Order, Anderson advised each of her firm’s 
public company audit clients that she must withdraw because she had been barred by the PCAOB 
as a result of violations of PCAOB rules and auditing standards.   

       7.      Around the same time, Anderson orally notified Carnahan—who was already aware 
of the PCAOB’s investigation of Anderson— and CYIOS’s then Director of Finance about the 
existence of the PCAOB Order and directed him to the PCAOB website.   Consequently, CYIOS 
and Carnahan knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known that Anderson had 
been barred from associating with a registered public accounting firm. 

       8.      After the PCAOB Order was issued, Anderson continued to perform accountancy 
and financial management services for CYIOS.  It was Carnahan’s decision to maintain CYIOS’s 
business relationship with Anderson.  Anderson’s services included providing CFO and general 
accounting services, assisting CYIOS’s CEO in preparing Commission filings – including Forms 
10-Q and 10-K – as well as other prohibited services.  CYIOS paid Anderson at least $244,035 for 
her services between August 2010 and June 2014. 

       9.      Anderson never requested or received consent from the PCAOB or the Commission 
to remain associated with CYIOS in this capacity.   

       C.      CYIOS FAILED TO MAKE PERIODIC FILINGS REQUIRED UNDER 
               SECTION 13(A) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT  

       10.    Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and the rules promulgated thereunder require 
issuers with classes of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act to file 
periodic and other reports with the Commission.  Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 require, respectively, the 
filing of accurate annual and quarterly reports (i.e., Forms 10-K and 10-Q). 

       11.    CYIOS ceased making filings required under Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act 
after it filed its third quarter 2012 Form 10-Q in November 2012.  Specifically, CYIOS failed to 
                                                                                             4
file its 2012 Form 10-K, its 2013 Forms 10-Q and 10-K, and its first quarter 2014 Form 10-Q.    
CYIOS filed a Form 15  -12g on May 30, 2014 which terminated the registration of its common

       See PCAOB Release No. 105-2010-007, available at 
http://pcaobus.org/Enforcement/Decisions/Documents/Traci_Jo_Anderson.pdf.

       CYIOS filed Forms 12b-25 to disclose it was unable to file its 2012 Form 10-K or first quarter 2013 Form 
10-Q when due, but did not do so for subsequently due filings. 

                                                3

stock.  Carnahan authorized each filing CYIOS made with the Commission and was responsible 
for CYIOS not making filings required under Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act. 

       D.      CARNAHAN FAILED TO ASSESS INTERNAL CONTROLS 

               i.     Legal Requirements 

       12.    In relevant part, Rule 13a-15(a) states that every issuer with a class of securities 
registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act and was either required to file an annual report 
pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act for the prior fiscal year or had filed an 
annual report for the prior fiscal year, must maintain internal control over financial reporting 
(“ICFR”).  Rule 13a-15(f) defines ICFR as process designed by the issuer’s executive management 
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation 
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles.    

       13.    Rule 13a-15(c) requires management of such issuers to evaluate, with the 
participation of the principal executive and principal financial officers (or persons performing 
similar functions) the effectiveness of the issuer’s ICFR as of the end of each fiscal year.  Rule 
13a-15(c) states that there are many different ways to conduct an evaluation of internal controls 
over financial reporting to meet the requirements of this rule, and that an issuer can comply with 
this requirement by conducting an evaluation in accordance with interpretive guidance issued by 
the Commission in Release No. 34-55929, Commission Guidance Regarding Management’s 
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Under Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, (the “2007 Guidance”).  

       14.    The registrant “must maintain evidential matter, including documentation, to 
provide reasonable support for management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the registrant’s 
internal control over financial reporting,” as stated in the instructions to Regulation SK, Item 308, 
Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  The 2007 Guidance similarly states “Management is 
responsible for maintaining evidential matter, including documentation to provide reasonable 
support for its assessment.   

       15.    Rule 13a-14, Certification of Disclosure in Annual and Quarterly Reports, requires 
each Form 10-Q and 10-K to include certifications signed by each principal executive and 
principal financial officer of the issuer (or persons performing similar functions).  Among other 
things, the certifying officers must confirm that the report does not contain any untrue statement of 
a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the 
circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period 
covered by [the] report. 

               ii.    Carnahan’s Assessments of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

       16.    CYIOS’s Forms 10-K for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2009, 2010, and 
2011 include management’s report on ICFR, as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(c) and Item 
308 of Regulation S-K.  CYIOS also included management’s report on ICFR in its 2010, 2011, and 

                                                4 
---------------------Page 5---------------------

                   5
2012 Forms 10-Q.   CYIOS stated in each report that management had assessed ICFR using the 
criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (the “COSO Framework”). 

       17.    These statements were false. CYIOS either did not evaluate ICFR, or did not 
evaluate ICFR using the COSO Framework. 

       18.    In addition, CYIOS did not maintain any documentation of management’s 
assessments of ICFR.  As discussed in the 2007 Guidance and stated in the instructions to 
Regulation S-K, Item 308, a registrant “must maintain evidential matter, including documentation, 
to provide reasonable support for management's assessment of the effectiveness of the registrant's 
internal control over financial reporting.” 

       19.    For these reasons, Carnahan’s certifications that CYIOS had assessed ICFR using 
the COSO Framework were false.     

       E.      OFFERS AND SALES OF SECURITIES 

       20.    After filing its 2009 Form 10-K on February 26, 2010, CYIOS issued, in exchange 
for consulting services and debt conversions, common stock under a registration statement filed on 
Form S-8 (No. 333-147695, filed November 29, 2007).  This registration statement incorporated by 
reference subsequent filings, including CYIOS’s 2009 Form 10-K and 2010 Forms 10-Q.  

       F.      VIOLATIONS 

       21.    As a result of the conduct described above, Anderson willfully violated, CYIOS 
violated, and Carnahan caused CYIOS’s violation of, Section 105(c)(7)(B) of Sarbanes-Oxley, 
which prohibits a person barred from associating with a registered public accounting firm from 
willfully becoming or remaining associated with an issuer in an accountancy or financial 
management capacity without consent of the PCAOB or the Commission and prohibits an issuer 
that knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known of such a bar, to permit such 
an association, without the consent of the PCAOB or the Commission.  

       22.    As a result of the conduct described above, CYIOS violated, and Carnahan caused 
CYIOS’s violations of, Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act.  Section 17(a)(2) 
makes it unlawful to, in the offer or sale of securities, obtain money or property by means of any 
untrue statement of a material fact or any omission to state a material fact necessary in order make 
the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not 
misleading. Section 17(a)(3) makes it unlawful to engage in any transaction, practice, or course of 
business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the purchaser. 

       23.    As a result of the conduct described above, CYIOS violated, and Carnahan caused 
CYIOS’s violations of, Section 13(a), and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder, which require 

                                                 
5
       Issuers are not required to disclose its assessment of ICFR in quarterly filings, but CYIOS nonetheless 
included and asserted in each 2012 Form 10-Q that management had conducted an assessment of ICFR and 
concluded that it was “effective.”  

                                                5 
---------------------Page 6---------------------

issuers with classes of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act to file 
periodic and other reports with the Commission. 

       24.    As a result of the conduct described above, Carnahan violated Rule 13a-14 of the 
Exchange Act, which requires an issuer’s principal executive and principal financial officer to 
attest that the company’s “report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact.” 

       25.    As a result of the conduct described above, Carnahan violated Rule 13a-15(c) of the 
Exchange Act, which requires each issuer’s management, with the participation of the principal 
executive and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, to perform an 
evaluation of the company’s ICFR as of the end of each fiscal year. 

                                                III. 

       In view of the allegations made by the Division of Enforcement and the Office of the Chief 
Accountant, the Commission deems it necessary and appropriate in the public interest that public 
administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings be instituted to determine: 

       A.      Whether the allegations set forth in Section II hereof are true and, in connection 
therewith, to afford each Respondent an opportunity to establish any defenses to such allegations;  

       B.      Whether, pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Respondents should be 
ordered to cease and desist from committing or causing any violation and any future violation of 
Section 105(c)(7)(B) of Sarbanes-Oxley. 

       C.      Whether, pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act, CYIOS and Carnahan should 
be ordered to cease and desist from committing or causing any violation and any future violation of 
Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act; 

       D.      Whether, pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, CYIOS and Carnahan should 
be ordered to cease and desist from committing or causing any violation and any future violation of 
Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder     ; 

       E.      Whether, pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Carnahan should be ordered 
to cease and desist from committing or causing any violation and any future violation of Rules 13a-
14 and 13a-15 ;  

       F.      Whether, pursuant to Section 4C of the Exchange Act and Rule 102(e) of the 
Commission’s Rules of Practice, Anderson should be censured or denied, temporarily or permanently, 
the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant;  
        
       G.      Whether, pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act and Section 21B of the 
Exchange Act, civil penalties should be levied against Respondents; and 
        
       H.      Whether, pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act and Sections 21B and 21C, 
respectively, of the Exchange Act, CYIOS and Anderson should be subject to disgorgement with 
prejudgment interest.

                                                IV. 

       IT IS ORDERED that a public hearing for the purpose of taking evidence on the questions 
set forth in Section III hereof shall be convened not earlier than 30 days and not later than 60 days 
from service of this Order at a time and place to be fixed, and before an Administrative Law Judge 
to be designated by further order as provided by Rule 110 of the Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 
C.F.R. § 201.110. 

       IT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED  that  Respondents  shall  file  an  Answer  to  the  allegations 
contained in this Order within twenty (20) days after service of this Order, as provided by Rule 220 
of the Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.220.  

       If a Respondent fails to file the directed answer, or fails to appear at a hearing after being 
duly notified, the Respondent may be deemed in default and the proceedings may be determined 
against him upon consideration of this Order, the allegations of which may be deemed to be true as 
provided by Rules 155(a), 220(f), 221(f) and 310 of the Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R.  
§§ 201.155(a), 201.220(f), 201.221(f) and 201.310. 

       This   Order   shall   be   served   forthwith   upon   Respondents  as   provided   for   in   the 
Commission’s Rules of Practice. 

       IT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED  that  the  Administrative  Law  Judge  shall  issue  an  initial 
decision no later than 300 days from the date of service of this Order, pursuant to Rule 360(a)(2) of 
the Commission’s Rules of Practice. 

       In the absence of an appropriate waiver, no officer or employee of the Commission engaged 
in  the  performance  of  investigative  or  prosecuting  functions  in  this  or  any  factually  related 
proceeding will be permitted to participate or advise in the decision of this matter, except as witness 
or counsel in proceedings held pursuant to notice.  Since this proceeding is not “rule making” within 
the meaning of Section 551 of the Administrative Procedure Act, it is not deemed subject to the 
provisions of Section 553 delaying the effective date of any final Commission action.
