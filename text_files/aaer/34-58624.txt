       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds2
                                                                                that: 

A.     SUMMARY 

       Video Without Boundaries, Inc. (“Video”), a consumer electronics company based in Fort 
Lauderdale, Florida, recorded fictitious revenue and assets at the direction of its sole officer and 
director through a number of accounting schemes, including improper revenue recognition, in 
violation of generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).  Stumacher audited Video’s 2002 
and 2003 annual financial statements and issued audit reports containing unqualified audit 
opinions, representing that the financial statements were presented in conformity with GAAP and 
that he conducted his audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards (“GAAS”).  
These representations were false because Video’s financial statements contained numerous 
departures from GAAP that materially overstated Video’s revenues and understated its net losses. 
Moreover, contrary to Stumacher’s audit reports, his audits were not conducted in accordance with 
GAAS because he utterly failed to comply with professional standards related to field work and 
general standards in the performance of his audits.  Stumacher thereby violated Section 10(b) of 
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and engaged in 
improper professional conduct within the meaning of Rule 102(e).    

B.     RESPONDENT 

       Norman Stumacher, CPA, age 81, of Bellmore, New York, is a certified public accountant 
licensed in New York since 1965.  Since 1990, Stumacher has done business as a sole proprietor.  
Stumacher served as Video’s auditor from April 2001 to February 2005.

 The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent’s Offer of Settlement and are not binding on any 
other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

C.     OTHER RELEVANT ENTITY 

       Video was incorporated in 1999 and operates in the consumer electronics market.  Since 
1999, Video’s common stock has been registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of 
the Exchange Act.  Video changed its name to MediaREADY, Inc. in September 2006 and, in 
March 2008, again changed its name to China Logistics Group, Inc. 

D. F    ACTS 

       1.     Video’s Fraudulent Accounting Practices 

              a.      Video, at the direction of its sole officer and director, engaged in fraudulent 
accounting practices that included improper revenue recognition and recording false entries in its 
annual financial statements for 2002 and 2003.   

              b.      In May 2002, Video signed a contract to provide services to an 
entertainment company, Cornerstone Entertainment Inc. (“Cornerstone”), in exchange for shares of 
Cornerstone stock.  Although Video received the shares of Cornerstone stock, Video never 
provided any services to Cornerstone because, shortly thereafter, Cornerstone went out of business.  
Notwithstanding its representation in its financial statements that “[s]ervice revenue is recognized 
when services are performed,” nearly all of the revenue Video reported in its Form 10-KSB for 
fiscal year 2002 – $325,000 of approximately $331,000 – was based on its improper recognition of 
services it never provided to Cornerstone.   

              c.      Moreover, although Cornerstone went out of business, Video recorded the 
Cornerstone stock as an investment (which it valued at approximately $211,000) in its annual 
financial statements for 2002.  Video even reported a fictitious stock dividend of Cornerstone 
shares to Video shareholders (which it valued at approximately $114,000) in its annual financial 
statements for 2002 and 2003.      

              d.      Commencing in 2003, Video had an informal arrangement with one of its 
distributors under which Video could ship its products to the distributor’s warehouse but the 
distributor was not obligated to pay for them until it sold them to third party customers.  Video 
used this arrangement to inflate its revenue in 2003.  Specifically, in its 2003 Form 10-KSB, nearly 
all of Video’s reported revenue – $189,000 of about $191,000 – was based on Video’s purported 
sales to the distributor.  In fact, Video did not sell any merchandise to the distributor in 2003, and 
overstated revenue by fraudulently recognizing the products shipped as sold. 

              e.      As a result of Video’s fraudulent accounting practices, Video filed Forms 
10-KSB for fiscal years 2002 and 2003 that materially overstated Video’s revenues and 
understated net losses.  Video restated its financial statements for the year ended December 31, 
2002 in June 2005 and again in September 2005.  Video restated its financial statements for the 
year ended December 31, 2003 in September 2005.  Based on the restatements, Video’s revenues, 
net losses, and total assets for fiscal year 2002 were misstated by over 5000%, 12%, and 276%, 

                                               3

---------------------Page 4---------------------

respectively. Based on the restatements, Video’s revenues, net losses, and total assets for fiscal 
year 2003 were misstated by over 10,000%, 33%, and 68%, respectively.   

       2.     Stumacher’s Failures in Connection With Video’s 2002 and 2003 Audits 

              a.      While conducting audits of Video’s financial statements for fiscal years 
2002 and 2003, Stumacher failed to comply with professional standards related to field work, 
including standards related to evidential matter, audit risk and materiality, consideration of fraud, 
analytical procedures and documentation, and general standards, including due professional care in 
the performance of the audits. 

              b.      Under the professional standards related to field work, Stumacher failed to 
consider audit risk, fraud, and materiality when planning and performing the audits of Video’s 
financial statements.  Stumacher did not develop nor document any audit procedures to assess audit 
risk.  He failed to consider adequately audit risk or identify significant business risks or unusual 
reporting issues. 

              c.      Additionally, in performing his field work, Stumacher was required to 
obtain corroborating evidential matter to support the accounting information Video provided.  
However, Stumacher failed to review any corroborating evidential matter, other than the 
Cornerstone agreement provided to him by Video’s management.  He made no other efforts to 
obtain or review any corroborating evidential matter concerning that agreement, the value of the 
Cornerstone stock, or the 2003 recorded sales to the distributor.   

              d.      Among other failures related to the auditing standards of field work, 
Stumacher failed to verify or perform any tests on any of the account balances in the general 
ledgers, failed to perform any procedures to identify related party transactions, and failed to 
perform any analytical procedures. 

  e             .     Stumacher also failed to prepare and maintain audit documentation to 
support his audit conclusions or to show a reasonable basis for his audit reports containing 
unqualified opinions on Video’s 2002 and 2003 financial statements.  Stumacher failed to create 
any audit programs, worksheets, schedules or analyses, planning or other memoranda, engagement 
or management representation letters, or documents reflecting that he observed auditing standards.   

  f            .      Contrary to Stumacher’s audit reports containing unqualified audit opinions 
on Video’s 2002 and 2003 annual financial statements, his audits were not conducted in 
accordance with GAAS and Video’s financial statements were not presented in conformity with 
GAAP. 

       3.     Violations 

              a.      Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder prohibit a 
person, in connection with the purchase or sale of a security, from making an untrue statement of a 
material fact or from omitting to state a material fact necessary to make statements made, in light 

                                                4

---------------------Page 5---------------------

of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.  An auditor violates Section 
10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder if he prepares and certifies publicly-filed 
financial statements that he knows, or is reckless in not knowing, are false.  Ponce v. SEC, 345 
F.3d 722, 729-30 (9th Cir. 2003); Anixter v. Home-Stake Prod. Co., 77 F.3d 1215, 1225-27 (10th 
Cir. 1996). Auditors also violate these provisions by issuing a false audit report.  McGann v. Ernst 
& Young, 102 F.3d 390, 397 (9th Cir. 1996); Ponce, 345 F.3d at 731 (auditors violated Section 
10(b) and Rule 10b-5 by issuing a false audit report).   

              b.      Stumacher willfully violated these antifraud provisions by issuing audit 
reports, in connection with Video’s 2002 and 2003 annual financial statements, which falsely 
stated that Video’s financial statements were presented in conformity with GAAP and that his 
audits were conducted in accordance with GAAS.   

       4.     Findings 

              a.      Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that Stumacher engaged in 
improper professional conduct pursuant to Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) of the Commission’s Rules of 
Practice. 

              b.      Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that Stumacher willfully 
violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  

                                              IV. 

       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in Respondent Stumacher’s Offer. 

       Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that: 

       A.     Stumacher shall cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any 
future violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; 

       B.     Stumacher is denied the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission 
as an accountant.

 By       the Commission.
