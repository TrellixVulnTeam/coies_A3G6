                                            I.  
 
       The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate that cease-
and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) against Marc J. Mize (“Mize” or “Respondent”).   
                                              
                                           II.

                                                III. 
 
                                                                                 1
        On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds  that  

                                            Summary 
 
       1.      This case involves a fraudulent scheme by the owner (the “CEO”) of four private 
telecommunications companies (collectively, “TelWorx”) to inflate the value of assets that the 
companies sold to PCTEL, Inc. (“PCTEL”), a public company, and its wholly owned subsidiary 
PCTelWorx, Inc. (“PCTelWorx”).  The scheme had two main components:  first, to inflate the value 
of inventory and to prematurely recognize revenue prior to the sale in order to fraudulently inflate 
the sale price; and second, to conceal these facts from PCTEL by prematurely recognizing revenue 
after the asset purchase.  Mize, an employee of TelWorx who joined PCTelWorx after the 
acquisition, participated in one of the fraudulent transactions – premature revenue recognition to 
meet a target revenue forecast – that was part of the scheme.     

                                         Respondent 
 
       2.      Marc J. Mize, age 43, is a resident of High Point, North Carolina.  From July 2012, 
until January 2013, he was the Senior Vice President of Sales and Tech Services of PCTelWorx.   

                            Other Relevant Entities And Individuals 
 
       3.      PCTEL, Inc. is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in 
Bloomingdale, Illinois.  The company provides products and services for wireless communication 
networks.  Its stock is traded on the NASDAQ (ticker symbol PCTI). 

       4.      PCTelWorx, Inc. was a wholly owned subsidiary of PCTEL.  PCTEL merged 
PCTelWorx into PCTEL on June 30, 2014.   

       5.      The CEO was the owner and CEO of one of the TelWorx companies.  After July 
2012, the CEO was the general manager of PCTelWorx, whose responsibilities included its day-to-
day operations and providing its quarterly revenue forecasts to PCTEL.   

                                             Background 
 
       6.      In July of 2012, PCTEL and PCTelWorx acquired the assets of TelWorx.  After the 
acquisition, the CEO ran PCTelWorx.  Thereafter, PCTelWorx operated similarly to TelWorx.

   The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent's Offer of Settlement and    are  not binding 
on any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.  
 

                                                 2  
---------------------Page 3---------------------

 
       7.      Prior to the acquisition, Mize was a TelWorx employee.  After the acquisition, he 
became an employee of PCTelWorx.   

       8.      In the third and fourth quarter of 2012, PCTEL’s publicly filed, consolidated 
financial statements included PCTelWorx’s financial results.   

                                       Revenue Forecasts 

       9.      Prior to the acquisition, the CEO provided PCTEL and PCTelWorx with TelWorx’s 
revenue forecasts for the second quarter of 2012.  Shortly before the acquisition, PCTEL learned 
that TelWorx did not meet the second quarter 2012 revenue forecast.  This revenue shortfall was 
due, in part, to a large order that a customer (“Customer A”) had postponed until the third quarter of 
2012.   

       10.    After the acquisition, PCTEL received PCTelWorx’s revenue forecasts from the 
CEO on a quarterly basis.  PCTelWorx employees, including Mize, knew that it was important to 
PCTEL’s business that PCTelWorx meet or exceed the quarterly revenue forecasts it provided to 
PCTEL.   

  PCTelWorx Creates A False Order In The Third Quarter To Conceal Revenue Shortfall 

       11.    Towards the end of the third quarter of 2012, PCTelWorx still had not received the 
large order from Customer A that the CEO forecasted for the third quarter, and the CEO realized 
that PCTelWorx would not meet its quarterly revenue forecast.   

       12.    The CEO decided to improperly use an intermediate purchaser for Customer A’s 
anticipated order to conceal the revenue forecast shortfall.  The CEO proposed that the intermediate 
purchaser eventually would resell the products to Customer A at a profit.  The CEO planned to offer 
the intermediate purchaser extended payment terms so that it could collect the full purchase price 
from Customer A before having to pay PCTelWorx’s invoice.  The CEO identified a vendor that 
provided services to – but that had not previously purchased a large order from – PCTelWorx (the 
“Vendor”) as a potential intermediate purchaser.   

       13.    Mize knew that the purpose of this false transaction was to artificially meet 
PCTelWorx’s forecasted third quarter revenue.  At the CEO’s direction, Mize spoke to the Vendor 
about the CEO’s proposal and obtained a purchase order with the same terms as the order that 
PCTelWorx expected eventually to receive from Customer A.   

       14.    Using the purchase order obtained by Mize, the CEO instructed a PCTelWorx 
employee (“the Employee”) to record the Vendor’s order in PCTelWorx’s books and records and to 
indicate that the order had been shipped to the Vendor and that the Vendor had been invoiced.  
These actions resulted in improper, premature revenue recognition in PCTelWorx’s books and 
records during the third quarter.   

                                                3  
---------------------Page 4---------------------

 
       15.    However, PCTelWorx never shipped the products listed on the false order to the 
Vendor, nor did it send the invoice for the false order to the Vendor.  PCTelWorx’s books and 
records indicated that the Vendor’s payment for the products was due and unpaid. 

            PCTelWorx Conceals Premature Revenue Recognition By Removing  
     A Legitimate Customer Order From Its Books And Records In the Fourth Quarter 

       16.    Midway through the fourth quarter, Customer A still had not placed the order with 
PCTelWorx expected by the CEO.  In addition, the payment for the false order by the Vendor was 
overdue.  The CEO became concerned that PCTEL would attempt to collect on the overdue invoice 
to the Vendor, detect the false order in its books and records and determine that PCTelWorx had 
recognized revenue prematurely in the third quarter.    

       17.    The CEO decided to conceal from PCTEL the false third quarter order from Vendor 
B by reversing it from PCTelWorx’s books and records and recording a new false transaction that 
matched an actual purchase order from another PCTelWorx customer (“Customer B”).  According 
to the CEO’s plan, Customer B’s order would be cancelled on PCTelWorx’s books, but Customer B 
would pay for the order placed by Vendor B.     

       18.    At the CEO’s instruction, Mize contacted the Vendor and obtained a revised, false 
purchase order that was identical to the order that PCTelWorx had received from Customer B.  
Mize knew that the purpose of this transaction was to conceal from PCTEL the false third quarter 
transaction with the Vendor by removing the false transaction from the third quarter from 
PCTelWorx’s books and records and replacing it with a false transaction that would be paid for by 
Customer B in the fourth quarter.   

       19.    The CEO and Mize, at the CEO’s direction, then instructed the Employee to cancel 
Customer B’s order and to reverse Vendor A’s false order from the third quarter in PCTelWorx’s 
books and records.  The CEO and Mize, at the CEO’s direction, also instructed the Employee to 
enter the Vendor’s revised, false purchase order into PCTelWorx’s books and records.  Ultimately, 
the items supposedly ordered by the Vendor pursuant to the revised, false purchase order were 
shipped to – and paid for – by Customer B.   

       20.    PCTEL discovered the false entries in PCTelWorx’s books and records.  PCTEL 
issued a Form 8-K/A on March 13, 2013, disclosing these irregularities but did not restate any 
financial information it previously reported.   

                                           Violations 

       21.    As a result of the conduct described above, Mize violated Section 13(b)(5) of the 
Securities Act which prohibits the knowing falsification of any book, record, or account or 
circumvention of internal controls. 

       22.    As a result of the conduct described above, Mize caused PCTEL’s violation of 
Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act, which requires Section 12 registrants to make and keep 

                                                4

books, records, and accounts that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of 
their assets.   

       23.    As a result of the conduct described above, Mize violated Rule 13b2-1 of the 
Exchange Act, which prohibits the direct or indirect falsification of any book, record or account 
subject to Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act. 

                                               IV. 
                                                  
       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in Respondent’s Offer. 
 
       Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that: 
 
       A.     Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Mize cease and desist from 
committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(5) 
of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 promulgated thereunder.   

       B.     Mize shall pay civil penalties of $25,000 to the Securities and Exchange 
Commission for transfer to the general fund of the United States Treasury in accordance with 
Exchange Act Section 21F(g)(3).  Payment shall be made in $5,000 installments within 10, 90, 180,
