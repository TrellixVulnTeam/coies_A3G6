                                                  I.  
 
       The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it  appropriate and in the public 
interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against Nicole Rae Kaplan 
(“Respondent” or “Kaplan”) pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(i) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice.1

 Rule 102(e)(3)(i) provides, in relevant part, that: 
 
       The Commission, with due regard to the public interest and without preliminary hearing, may, by

                                                  II.  
 
       In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer of  
Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the purpose of these 
proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the Commission, or to which the 
Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings herein, except as to the 
Commission’s jurisdiction over her and the subject matter of these proceedings, and the findings contained 
in Section III.3 below, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting 
Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making 
Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (“Order”), as set forth below.   
 
                                                  III.  
 
       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that:  
 
       1.     Kaplan, age 40, of Agoura Hills, California, became a certified public accountant licensed to 
practice in the State of California in 1996; her license expired in February 2005.  Kaplan began work at                              
Vitesse Semiconductor Corporation (“Vitesse” or the “Company”), in 1998 as Manager of Finance, and in 
2004 she became the Company’s Director of Finance.  She officially resigned from Vitesse on April 14, 
2006. 
        
       2.     Vitesse based in Camarillo, California, is a major producer of high-performance integrated 
circuits for use primarily by systems manufacturers in the storage and communications industries.  Vitesse  
was incorporated in Delaware in 1987, is headquartered in Camarillo, California, and maintains a 
September 30 th
               fiscal year-end.  During the relevant period, the Company’s common stock was registered 
with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) 
and traded on the Nasdaq National Market under th e symbol VTSS.  The Co mpany’s common stock is 
currently traded on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol “VTSS.”     
 
       3.     On March 22, 2011, a final judgment was entered against Kaplan, permanently enjoining 
her from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of 
the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder, and  aiding and abetting violations of 
Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 
thereunder, in the civil action entitled Securities and Exchange Commission v. Nicole R. Kaplan, et al., 
Civil Action Number 10-CV-9239, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New 
York. Kaplan was also ordered to pay $31,050 in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and $16,445 in 
prejudgment interest. 
 
       4.     The Commission’s complain    t alleged, among other things, that Vitesse engaged in 
fraudulent revenue recognition practices that resulted in the Company filing with the Commission 
materially false and misleading financial statements in annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports 
on Forms 10-Q from at least late 2001 through early 2006.  The complaint alleges that Kaplan participated 
in prematurely and improperly recording revenues  on product shipments to Vitesse’s distributors and 

                                                   2

customers; failed to timely and properly record customer credits from the return of unwanted product; and 
directed the misapplication of cash to account receivable balances in order to obscure the true age of the 
receivables.  The complaint alleges that Kaplan engaged in the foregoing misconduct from late 2001 
through 2005.  As a result, the complaint alleges that Kaplan, among other violations:  engaged in 
fraudulent accounting practices that materially misstated the company’s annual and quarterly financial 
statements, which she reviewed or participated in preparing; knowingly circumvented or failed to 
implement Vitesse’s system  of internal accounting controls and falsified Vitesse’s books, records, or  
accounts; and made material misrepresentations to Vitesse’s independent auditor. 
         
                                                           IV. 
                                                              
         In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it  appropriate and in the public interest to impose 
the sanction agreed to in Respondent Kaplan’s Offer. 
 
         Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that:  
 
        Kaplan is suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission               as an accountant.   
 
 
 By the Commission.              
 
 
 
       Elizabeth                                                               M. Murphy
       Secretary
