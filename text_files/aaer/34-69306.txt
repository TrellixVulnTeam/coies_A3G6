                                           I. 
 
      The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) deems it appropriate and in the 
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against Colleen 
Erin Kelly Bishop ("Bishop" or Respondent) pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(i) of the Commissions 
Rules of Practice.1
                   
                                             

                                                 
1
 Rule 102(e)(3)(i) provides, in relevant part, that:  
 
      The Commission, with due regard to the public interest and without preliminary hearing, 
may, by order, . . . suspend from appearing or practicing before it any . . . accountant . . . who has 
been by name . . . permanently enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction, by reason of his 
or her misconduct in an action brought by the Commission, from violating or aiding and abetting 
the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or of the rules and regulations 
thereunder.

                                              II. 
 
       In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the Offer) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the 
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings 
herein, except as to the Commissions jurisdiction over her and the subject matter of these 
proceedings, and the findings contained in Section III.3 below, which are admitted, Respondent 
consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Rule 102(e) 
of the Commissions Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions 
(Order), as set forth below.   
 
                                              III. 
 
       On the basis of this Order and Respondents Offer, the Commission finds that:  
        
              1.      Bishop, is a California resident and is a California Certified Public 
Accountant.  Bishop is a sole practitioner and conducted audits of the financial statements for 
Asthma Disease Management, Inc. (ADMI) for the fiscal year ended May 31, 1993 through the 
fiscal year ended May 31, 1999.   
        
              2.      ADMI was, at all relevant times, a Delaware corporation, which had its 
principal place of business in Berlin, New Jersey.  ADMI marketed proprietary asthma disease 
management programs, focusing on allergy testing and diagnostic techniques by primary care 
physicians.  At all relevant times, ADMI had reporting obligations under Section 15(d) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and its stock traded over-the-counter in the 
pink sheets. 
        
              3.      On September 24, 2002, the Commission filed a complaint against Bishop 
in SEC v. Asthma Disease Management, Inc., et al. (Civil Action No. 02-CV-7436 (E.D.Pa.)).  On 
March 14, 2013, the court entered an order permanently enjoining Bishop, by consent, from aiding 
and abetting violations of Sections 10(b) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 
15d-1 and 15d-3 thereunder. 
 
              4.      The Commissions complaint alleged, among other things, that  
 ADMI, along with its former president, CEO, and chairman of the board, and two of its directors, 
 engaged in a fraudulent marketing scheme in which they issued false press releases, fraudulently 
 inflated ADMIs assets and disseminated misleading information in Commission filings by 
 omitting the auditors going concern opinion and by failing to disclose significant stock-based 
 executive compensation and related party transactions.  The complaint further alleges that 
 Bishop aided and abetted the fraud by improperly booking a material asset on ADMIs balance 
 sheet, by failing to review ADMIs Forms 10-K before or after they were filed with the 
 Commission, and by failing to conduct her audit of ADMIs financial statements in accordance 
 with generally accepted auditing standards.

                                              IV. 
                                                 
       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
impose the sanction agreed to in Respondent Bishops Offer. 
 
       Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that: 
 
       Bishop is suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an 
accountant. 
 
       By the Commission.
