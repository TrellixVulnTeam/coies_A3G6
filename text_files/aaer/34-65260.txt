       In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the

                                              III.  
 
       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that:  
 
       A.      Orr served as chief financial officer of Brooke Corporation (“Brooke”) from 1995 
until March 11, 2008, and as chief executive officer of Brooke from March 11, 2008 until October 
17, 2008.  Orr served as chief financial officer of Brooke Capital Corp. (“Brooke Capital”) from 
November 15, 2007 until August 15, 2008.  Orr is and has been  a certified public accountant 
licensed in the state of Kansas.   
 
       B.      Brooke was, at all relevant times, a Kansas corporation with its principal place of 
business in Overland Park, Kansas.  Brooke was a provider of banking, insurance, and other  
financial services.  At all relevant times, Brooke’s common stock was registered with the  
Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), 
and traded on the NASDAQ Global Market.  Brooke Capital was, at all relevant times, a Kansas 
corporation with its principal place of business in  Overland Park, Kansas.  Brooke Capital operated 
a franchise network of insurance agents.  At all relevant times, Brooke Capital’s common stock was 
registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, and traded on the 
American Stock Exchange. 
        
       C.      On July 13, 2011, a judgment was entered against Orr, permanently enjoining him 
from future violations of Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities 
Act”), Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 
thereunder, and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the 
Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder, in the civil action entitled 
Securities and Exchange Commission v. Leland G. Orr, Case Number 11-CV-2251 WEB/KGG, in 
the United States District Court for the District of Kansas.   
        
       D.      The Commission’s complaint alleged, among other things, that Orr was responsible 
for Brooke filing materially false and misleading financial statements in the company’s Form 10-K 
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007, and in the company’s Forms 10-Q for the period 
ended March 31, 2008, the period ended June 30, 2008 and Amended 2008 Form 10-Q for that 
period, and Form S-3 filed May 28, 2008, and for Brooke Capital filing materially false and

misleading financial statements in the company’s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December  
31, 2007, and in the company’s Forms 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2008 and June 30, 
2008.  The Complaint alleged that  Orr engaged in a number of improper accounting practices that 
materially misstated the net income of Brooke and Brooke Capital in a departure from generally 
accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), including, among other things, improperly recognizing  
loan fee revenue on unfunded loans, and failing to adjust and to record adequate reserves for 
uncollectable franchise accounts receivable which were commonly referred to as statement and 
non-statement balances. 
        
       E.      In addition, the Complaint alleged that Orr allowed consolidation of Aleritas 
Capital Corporation’s (“Aleritas”) financial statements into Brooke’s financial statements, with 
knowledge that Aleritas  improperly reduced second quarter collateral preservation expenses and 
established a collateral recovery asset during the second quarter of 2008, thereby materially 
misstating the financial statements contained in  Brooke’s Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 
2008 and Amended 2008 Form 10-Q for that period. 
        
       F.      In addition, the Complaint alleged that Orr made certifications of Brooke’s Form             
10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007, and in the company’s Forms 10-Q for the 
period ended March 31, 2008, the period ended June 30, 2008 and Amended 2008 Form 10-Q for  
the that period, and Brooke Capital’s Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2007, and 
Forms 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2008 and June 30, 2008, which contained untrue 
statements of material fact, and omitted material facts necessary to make the statements made 
therein, in light of the circumstances under which the statements were made, not misleading.   
        
       G.      In addition, the Complaint alleged that Orr reviewed and signed Brooke’s Form              
10-K for the period ended December 31, 2007, Forms 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2008, 
the period ended June 30, 2008 and Amended 2008 Form  10-Q for that period, and Form S-3 filed 
May 28, 2008, and Brooke Capital’s Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2007, and 
Forms 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2008 and J une 30, 2008, which contained material 
misrepresentations and omitted material facts.  Those misrepresentations and omissions included, 
among other things:  
        
              1.	   the extent to which franchise location numbers and growth included abandoned 
                  and failed locations;  
                   
              2.	   the nature and extent of Brooke Capital’s financial assistance to franchisees,  
                  including, the number of franchisees receiving financial assistance, the long-
                  term and recurring nature of such financial assistance to some franchisees, the 
                  dependence of some franchisees on such financial assistance to continue 
                  operations, and Brooke Capital’s payment of principal and interest on some 
                  franchisee loans to Aleritas;  and 
                   
              3.	   the extent to which Brooke and Brooke Capital were profitable, liquid, and able 
                  to cash flow. 
 

                                               3
  
---------------------Page 4---------------------

         H.       In addition, the Complaint alleged that Orr  made false or misleading statements and 
failed to disclose information to the independent auditors and accountants              of Brooke and Brooke  
Capital about certain of the companies’ fraudulent accounting practices.   
          
         I.        In addition, the Complaint alleged that Orr failed to make and keep accurate books                                                 
and records of Brooke and Brooke Capital with regards to the misstatements of their financial 
statements. 
          
         J.        In addition, the Complaint alleged that Orr failed to devise and maintain a system of  
internal accounting controls sufficient to prevent, detect and correct the misstatements of the 
financial statements of Brooke and Brooke Capital. 
 
 
                                                         IV. 
                                                            
         In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
impose the sanction agreed to in Respondent Orr’s Offer. 
 
         Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that: 
 
         Orr is suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant.   
 
 By the Commission.
