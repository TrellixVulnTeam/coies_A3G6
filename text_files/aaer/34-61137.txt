                                      PURSUANT TO SECTION 12(j) OF THE 
Respondent. 
                         SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934  
 

  
                                       I. 
 
      The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it necessary 
and appropriate for the protection of investors that proceedings be, and hereby are, 
instituted pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange 
Act”), against Applied Wellness Corporation (“Applied Wellness” or “Respondent”).  
 
                                       II. 
 
      After an investigation, the Division of Enforcement alleges that: 
 
      1.     Applied Wellness Corporation (CIK No. 0001134011) is a Nevada 
corporation located in San Diego, California.  Pursuant to its Form 10-KSB filed on April 
15, 2008, it purported to distribute “devices for non-invasive therapeutic applications 
based on the latest advances in the field of ionic therapies” through its subsidiary, Energy 
Balance Resources, Inc.  The common stock of Applied Wellness has been registered 
with the Commission under Exchange Act Section 12(g) since April 8, 2001.  Applied 
Wellness common stock is quoted on the Pink Sheets operated by Pink OTC Markets Inc. 
(symbol: AAWL) and is eligible for the “piggyback” exception of Rule 15c2-11 of the 
Exchange Act.

       2.     While its common stock was registered with the Commission, Applied 
Wellness failed to comply with Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-15 
thereunder in that it failed to make disclosures in its Form 10-KSB for the fiscal year 
ended December 31, 2007, filed with the Commission on April 15, 2008, concerning its 
internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, as 
required by Items 307 and 308T of Regulation S-B. 
        
       3.     While its common stock was registered with the Commission, Applied 
Wellness failed to comply with Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rule 13a-13 thereunder 
in that it has not filed any periodic or quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for any fiscal 
period subsequent to its fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2008.   
        
       4.     While its common stock was registered with the Commission, Applied 
Wellness failed to comply with Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rule 13a-1 thereunder in 
that it failed to file an annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,  
2008. 
 
                                          III. 
  
       In view of the allegations made by the Division of Enforcement, the Commission deems 
it necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors that public administrative proceedings 
be instituted to determine:  
 
       A.     Whether the allegations contained in Section II are true and, in connection 
therewith, to afford the Respondent an opportunity to establish any defenses to such allegations; 
and 
 
       B.     Whether it is necessary or appropriate for the protection of investors, to suspend 
for a period not exceeding twelve months, or revoke the registration of each class of securities of 
the Respondent registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act.  
 
                                          IV. 
 
       IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that a public hearing for the purpose of taking evidence on 
the questions set forth in Section III hereof shall be convened at a time and place to be fixed, and 
before an Administrative Law Judge to be designated by further order as provided by Rule 110 
of the Commission’s Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R. § 201.110].  
 
       IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent shall file an Answer to the 
allegations contained in this Order within twenty (20) days after service of this Order, as 
provided by Rule 220(b) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R. § 201.220(b)].  
 
       If Respondent fails to file the directed Answer, or fails to appear at a hearing after being 
duly notified, the Respondent may be deemed in default and the proceedings may be determined 

                                           2

against it upon consideration of this Order, the allegations of which may be deemed to be true as 
provided by Rules 155(a), 220(f), 221(f), and 310 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice [17 
C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), 201.220(f), 201.221(f), and 201.310]. 
 
        This Order shall be served forthwith upon Respondent personally or by certified, 
registered, or Express Mail, or by other means of verifiable delivery.  
 
        IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Administrative Law Judge shall issue an initial 
decision no later than 120 days from the date of service of this Order, pursuant to Rule 360(a)(2) 
of the Commission’s Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R. § 201.360(a)(2)].  
 
        In the absence of an appropriate waiver, no officer or employee of the Commission 
engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions in this or any factually 
related proceeding will be permitted to participate or advise in the decision of this matter, except 
as witness or counsel in proceedings held pursuant to notice.  Since this proceeding is not “rule 
making” within the meaning of Section 551 of the Administrative Procedure Act, it is not 
deemed subject to the provisions of Section 553 delaying the effective date of any final 
Commission action.  
 
        By the Commission.
