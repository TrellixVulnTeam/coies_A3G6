              Grounds for Remedial Action

                     Antifraud and reporting violations

       Corporate officer, who served as chief financial officer and then corporate controller,
       falsely represented to auditors that corporation's consolidated financial statements were in
       conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and that no events had occurred
       within stated period that had a material effect on financial statements or should have been
       disclosed in order to keep statements from being misleading; made misleading statements
       and omitted to state facts that would make representations in corporation's annual report
       not misleading; and failed to see that corporation implemented adequate internal controls,
       resulting in inaccuracies in corporation's books, records, and accounts, thereby violating
       and causing the corporation to violate antifraud and reporting provisions of the federal
       securities laws and rules thereunder.  Held, it is in the public interest for respondent to be
       ordered to cease and desist from committing or causing further antifraud and reporting 
       violations.

       Rita J. McConville appeals from the decision of an administrative law judge.  The law
judge found that McConville had significant responsibility for the financial statements in the
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2000 (the "2000 Form 10-K") filed by her employer,
Akorn, Inc. ("Akorn" or "the Company"), which materially inflated Akorn's accounts receivable,
net sales, and assets; caused Akorn to maintain inaccurate books and records; and falsely assured
Akorn's auditors that the financial statements in the 2000 Form 10-K complied with Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") and that she did not know of any events that would
materially impact those financial statements.  2/  In so doing, the law judge found, McConville
violated Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934  3/ and Rules 10b-5,
13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder,  4/ and caused Akorn to violate Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the

1/     Rule of Practice 451(d), 17 C.F.R. § 201.451(d), provides that a member of the
       Commission who does not attend an oral argument may participate in the decision of the
       proceeding if that member reviews the oral argument transcript.  Commissioner
       Glassman, who did not attend the oral argument in this matter, has performed the
       requisite review.

2/     The Financial Accounting Standards Board promulgates GAAP, which are the
       "conventions, rules, and procedures that define accepted accounting practice."  Barron's
       Dictionary of Finance and Investment Terms 234-35 (5th ed. 1998).   Regulation S-X, 17

cease and desist from violating and causing violations of these provisions, and to pay

independent review of the record, except with respect to those findings not challenged on appeal.
 
                                              II.

Background

       McConville served as chief financial officer ("CFO") of Akorn from February 28, 1997
until March 20, 2001, when she was succeeded by Kevin M. Harris.  6/  From March 21 to July,
2001, McConville was employed by Akorn as corporate controller.  During most of the time in
question,  McConville reported to Floyd Benjamin, Akorn's president and chief executive officer
("CEO").  As CFO, McConville supervised Akorn's corporate controller and its finance
department, and was responsible for working with Deloitte & Touche LLP ("Deloitte"), Akorn's
auditors.  As CFO, McConville, together with Akorn's controller, Thomas Costello, was
responsible for Akorn's filings with the Commission.  In its 2000 Form 10-K,  filed with the
Commission pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act,  7/  Akorn reported net income of
$2,187,000 in 2000.  Akorn reported current assets of $42,123,000 as of December 31, 2000, and
accounts receivable of $24,144,000, which amounted to approximately 57% of Akorn's current
assets.  

       At all relevant times, Akorn was a corporation that, among other things, manufactured
and sold diagnostic and therapeutic pharmaceuticals.  Although Akorn's customers included both
pharmaceutical wholesalers and direct or end-use customers, a large portion of its sales were
made to wholesale distributors.  In 2000, Akorn's sales to five such distributors (the "top five
wholesale customers") accounted for 43% of its total sales in 2000 and approximately 60% of its
gross accounts receivable as of December 31, 2000. 

Akorn's Problems With Tracking Customer Account Status

       Both Akorn's computer system and some of its business practices made keeping track of
its customer accounts problematic.  When McConville arrived at Akorn in 1997, the company

5/     15 U.S.C. §§ 78m(a), 78m(b)(2); 17 C.F.R. §§ 240.12b-20, 240.13a-1.

6/     Harris was a respondent in this proceeding.  The law judge found that he willfully
       violated Rule 13b2-2 and that he willfully aided and abetted and caused Akorn's
       violations of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1, 13a-13, and 12b-20.  She
       declined to impose sanctions on Harris.  Rita J. McConville, Initial Decision Rel. No. 259
       (Sept. 27, 2004), 83 SEC Docket 3325, 3364-73.

7/     15 U.S.C. § 78m.
---------------------Page 4---------------------

                                               4

billed customers and processed cash remittances and credit claims against invoices at three
different finance offices, each of which used a different accounting software system.  By late
1999, however, Akorn had centralized its finance, billing, and accounts receivable records on a
software program called Macola.  Later, primarily during 2000, Akorn shifted many of its
records, at all of its locations, onto a J.D. Edwards software package, which allowed more
sophisticated information recording.  In connection with this transition, Akorn recorded new
receivables on the J.D. Edwards software, but did not transfer existing accounts receivable due to
concerns that conversion might not preserve the integrity of the data.
  
       Akorn's terms of sale varied among customers, with payment schedules of between 30
and 90 days.  Wholesalers generally enjoyed longer payment terms than direct customers.  Akorn
did not charge interest on overdue bills.  Akorn classified its aging reports as current, 30-60 days
past due, 60-90 days past due, and over 90 days past due.

       Extensive paperwork was involved in keeping track of customer orders and payments. 
With each shipment to a wholesaler, Akorn issued and sent an invoice.  A 25- or 30-page invoice
was not uncommon.  A customer payment to Akorn was accompanied by a remittance advice of
up to 400 lines in length, which explained the payment and asserted claims, where applicable, to
a variety of credits.  8/  Akorn was unable to match customer payments or credits to invoice
numbers, so it could not post a receipt against a particular invoice.  9/  

8/     Kevin Harris, who succeeded McConville as CFO, testified that a 22-page remittance
       advice would be considered short.  The credits, which were available under various terms
       with varying deadlines,  included chargebacks, or credits for the difference between the
       list price wholesalers were billed for products and the contract price to certain end users
       who had special contractual arrangements with Akorn, as well as various rebates. 

9/     McConville testified that chargebacks, for example, were identified by product batch
       number, not invoice number, and that the same batch number could appear on 150 or
       more invoices.  Thus, matching a chargeback to an invoice was impossible.  Customers
       did not always use the same numbers Akorn used, which created further problems. 

       Mario Delgado, a Deloitte auditor involved with Akorn's fiscal year 2000 audit, testified
       that the Macola system "didn't link together a debit with a credit that may have
       subsequently been issued or a payment that may have been subsequently received." 
       Delgado explained: 

              Typically  . . . you would want to link all that together and . . . simply understand
              what is this customer still owing.  So I invoice them $100 and subsequently issued
              a credit for $10 and a subsequent payment of $90, what you really are concerned
              about is they owe zero.  . . .  Most companies do link those three together and 
              just . . . wouldn't show anything for that customer because it's paid off.

       Using the Macola software to review the aging of accounts receivable presented particular
difficulties.  10/  In Macola as used at Akorn, the age of receivables was determined from when
the invoices were issued.  The Macola software also kept track of payments, credits, and rebates,
based on when they were applied to the account.  Akorn used the term "aging" indiscriminately
to apply to receivables, payments, credits, and rebates, categorizing them in "buckets" or brackets
to indicate how recently the invoice had been issued or the payment, credit, or rebate had been
applied.  Thus, related items (original invoice, payment, and credit) often appeared in different
aging "buckets" depending on the dates of the transactions.  11/  An "aging" report for a single
customer, showing all transactions with that customer, by date, could have as many as 4000 lines. 
Additionally, the Macola system was incapable of handling certain tasks that involved a high
volume of transactions without ceasing to function.   Thus, a detailed review of the age of
accounts receivable in Macola was virtually impossible.  12/

McConville's Awareness Of And Attempts to Address Problems With Tracking Customer
Accounts

       On February 25, 2000, Deloitte sent a letter to Akorn's board of directors, to which it
attached a report prepared in connection with Deloitte's audit of Akorn's financial statements for
the year ended December 31, 1999.  The report commented on, among other things, Akorn's
internal controls.  Under the heading "Accounts Receivable," the report noted management's
failure to review the accounts receivable in detail, misapplication of credits and payments to

10/    Although Akorn did not charge interest on overdue bills, the age of receivables was
       nonetheless important because, as testified by Jack Maire, a consultant brought in to
       analyze Akorn's receivables, the older a receivable is, the more difficult it becomes to
       collect it.  Moreover, the passage of time sometimes made it difficult for Akorn to
       produce documentation to prove what it was owed.  Nancy Phillips, Akorn's assistant
       controller from March 1999 to September 2001, testified that proofs of delivery were
       often unobtainable after nine months to a year and that Akorn "pretty often" lacked
       documentation to support its assertion of amounts due.  Phillips also testified that in her
       experience, wholesalers in some instances purposely waited to pay until the nine months
       or year had passed so that proofs of delivery would be unobtainable.

11/    As Delgado explained:  "[A]n invoice would typically be issued first and would age based
       on the invoice date.  Subsequent to that a credit might be issued, say, a month later.  And
       subsequent to that a payment might be received, let's say, a month after that.  In that
       scenario the invoice would age one month before the credit which would age one month
       before the payment.  And so you could find yourself in a situation where you could have
       an invoice . . . in one aging bucket, a credit issued in a subsequent bucket, and a payment
       issued in a third more recent bucket."

12/    Akorn generated some summary aging reports, but Delgado testified that the reports had
       "little or no value."

                                               6

customer accounts, and failure to collect on outstanding balances effectively and efficiently. 
Deloitte recommended reconciling customer accounts with the customers, starting with the
wholesaler accounts.  The corresponding section of the report captioned "Management
Response," which was drafted in part by McConville, stated that management had begun an
effort to reconcile all customer accounts and pursue payment of aged balances, with a goal of
"significant collection resolution by June 30, 2000 and complete cleanup by August 31, 2000." 
This management goal was not met.

       Concerns were also expressed at both board and audit committee meetings that as Akorn's
sales were growing, more and more receivables were moving into the older aging "buckets," i.e.,
were remaining uncollected for longer times.  At McConville's request, Akorn's controller and its
accounts receivable manager analyzed the available data and posited that a major factor for the
increase in aging was the increase in percentage of sales to wholesalers, who were allowed more
time to pay than Akorn's direct customers.  Nonetheless, the aging of receivables remained a
management and audit committee concern.
    
       During 2000, Akorn realized approximately 12% of its net sales from Cardinal Health,
Inc. ("Cardinal") , and Cardinal's accounts receivable balance represented approximately 22% of
gross accounts receivable.  This made Cardinal both Akorn's largest customer and the customer
with the largest accounts receivable balance.  In the fourth quarter of 2000,  John Kapoor,
chairman of the board of Akorn and a major stockholder, instructed McConville and Benjamin to
meet with Cardinal and try to collect some of the money Cardinal owed to Akorn.  In February,
2001, when the meeting took place, Akorn's records showed that Cardinal owed it approximately
$4 million, based on invoices going back at least as far as 1999.  Cardinal's own records showed
that the balance was approximately $800,000 in Cardinal's favor, yielding a discrepancy of nearly
$5 million.  13/  McConville took with her to the meeting copies of open invoices from various
dates, selecting the invoices involving the largest dollar amounts so that resolution would yield
the biggest results.  14/  After the meeting, Cardinal sent Akorn a check for approximately
$913,000, which it viewed as resolving all open issues from the meeting.  15/  Cardinal informed

13/    Witnesses explained the discrepancy as due in part to Akorn's practice of booking a
       receivable as soon as the invoice was issued, while Cardinal forwarded the invoices it
       received to its distribution centers for verification before submitting them for processing,
       thus occasioning some delay.  Moreover, Cardinal did not record the invoice as a payable
       until it was due, as much as 90 days later.  Additionally, McConville testified that some
       of the invoices shown on Akorn's records did not appear on Cardinal's records.

14/    McConville testified that she believed she took only invoices for more than $10,000.  
       Other evidence suggests that the invoices were for more than $50,000. 

15/    In an e-mail following up on the meeting, Cardinal stated that it had been unable to
       research some of the 1999 invoices, but that those "accounted for immaterial amounts
                                                                                   (continued...)
---------------------Page 7---------------------

                                               7

Akorn that, having sent the $913,000 check, it regarded itself as in a credit position vis-a-vis
Akorn. 

       Although Cardinal thought the issues raised by the meeting had been resolved, Akorn
believed that many issues were still outstanding.  A March 15, 2001 letter from Benjamin to
Cardinal stated that there was still a discrepancy of more than $5 million to be reconciled
between the Akorn records and the Cardinal records, opining that the $913,000 check represented
only resolution of certain individual open invoices and there were still smaller open invoices to
reconcile, as well as issues involving rebates.  16/ 
 
       Despite the uncertainty of the situation, McConville told Deloitte that Cardinal had
agreed to send Akorn a $913,000 check, and that indications were positive in terms of
receivables.  17/  McConville also told Deloitte that there was little past due money owing from
wholesalers because most of the old bills were offset by more recent credits. 
 
       At around the time of McConville's and Benjamin's meeting with Cardinal,  Kapoor
received a telephone call from The Northern Trust Company ("Northern Trust"), with which
Akorn had a banking relationship, raising questions about Akorn's financial condition and
requesting that Kapoor make an additional equity investment in Akorn of $3 million.  18/ 
Kapoor promptly arranged to meet with Akorn management and its board of directors.  In a
memorandum dated March 7, 2001, Kapoor assigned McConville and Harris to work with Jack
Maire, a consultant brought in by Kapoor, on a thorough analysis of Akorn's accounts receivable
and to submit a report discussing any potential write-offs of the receivables by the end of March.

The Maire Report

       By mid-March, 2001, Maire concluded that Akorn's need for a quick infusion of cash
could not be satisfied by collecting past due receivables.  In a draft memorandum to Kapoor,

15/    (...continued)
       relative to the other invoices." 

16/    Although it is unclear from the record that McConville saw Benjamin's March 15 letter,
       she clearly knew that there was a $5 million discrepancy between Akorn's and Cardinal's
       accounting prior to the payment of the $913,000 check. 

17/    The record is unclear as to when McConville told Deloitte about the $913,000 check. 
       Delgado testified that he received assurances "throughout our audit [that] things were
       positive and the conversations indicated that collections were reasonable."

18/    It is unclear from the record whether Akorn had defaulted on an existing loan or whether
       the bank insisted on the additional investment as a condition of extending or renewing a
       line of credit.
---------------------Page 8---------------------

                                               8

Maire concluded that "there are no quick fixes available" (emphasis in original).  19/  Maire
indicated that, due to the scope and complexity of the receivables problem, he was unable at that
time to provide an assessment of what was collectible and what the magnitude of write-offs
might be.  He concluded that "a determination on the collectibility will require a substantial
amount of time (months) and work."

       Maire recognized that, because Akorn's accounts receivable were concentrated among its
top five wholesale customers, it might appear "that it should be relatively easy to collect on those
five accounts and achieve the quick infusion of cash that we are looking for."  His analysis,
however, revealed that this was not the case:

       [T]he wholesaler accounts have never been worked. We are talking about an
       accumulation of problems over a 3 or 4 year period.  This provides us with a legacy of
       pages and pages of A/R reports on each of those five accounts, consisting of a maze of
       transactions including:  open invoices, partially paid invoices, billbacks, credits for return
       goods, credits for damaged goods, credits for shipments not received, credits for billing
       errors, rebate credits, chargeback credits, deductions taken arbitrarily by the wholesaler,
       situations where the wholesaler used credits multiple times, and unapplied cash.  These
       transactions go back as far as 1996.

(Emphasis in original).  In Maire's view, the failure to have systematically reconciled the
accounts receivable "magnifies the task to an incredibly detailed undertaking."  20/  He identified
"a wide array of process and system issues that severely complicate matters," including the
following:

       !     The Macola system and the J.D. Edwards system operated simultaneously, with
              the pre-2001 accounts receivable on Macola.  "This duplicates work and
              complicates matters considerably."

       !     "No management reports exist that trend sales, cash, A/R aging, reserves,
              unbilled, or [days sales outstanding].  Therefore, the A/R could not have been
              properly monitored."

       !     "A/R aging reports have not been previously printed.  The staff has had no way to
              set collection priorities.  Producing a simple aging report in descending dollar
              sequence proved to be a week-long task to accomplish, and then only with outside
              consulting help because no one within the building knew how to do it."

19/    McConville testified that she did not see the memorandum while employed at Akorn.

20/    Maire thought that Akorn staff did not have sufficient skills and experience to handle the
       work.  
---------------------Page 9---------------------

                                               9

       !     "Daily reports need to be published to monitor all facets affecting receivables,
              including unbilled, chargebacks processing backlogs, cash posting backlogs, and
              returns good credit processing.  If any one of these is failing to be processed
              timely, the customer will not pay.  The wholesaler will go ahead and take a
              deduction in the absence of a timely credit due him, which only complicates the
              maze of transactions already on the A/R." 

Maire also noted, among other matters, problems with staffing, and stated that "[c]hargebacks
may be a problem area." 

       On March 20, 2001, the board voted to dismiss Benjamin as CEO, making him a vice
president of Akorn, and to dismiss McConville as CFO.  Kapoor became interim CEO, and
Kevin Harris, who had been asked by Kapoor to help address Akorn's financial situation
following the telephone call from Northern Trust, was appointed interim CFO.  McConville was
initially asked to work under Harris's direction on various projects, but shortly thereafter Harris
asked her to work with him, Maire, and several other Akorn employees on reconciling the
Cardinal account.  As of the end of April, 2001, McConville had identified Cardinal receivables
totaling nearly $1.5 million from Akorn's aging report that were not included in a report showing
amounts due and payable that she had obtained from Cardinal.
  
McConville's Involvement With The Fiscal Year 2000 Audit

       While McConville was working on reconciling the Cardinal account, Deloitte was
proceeding with work on its audit of Akorn for the year ended December 31, 2000.  As noted
above, McConville's responsibilities as CFO had included working with Deloitte auditors as
Deloitte performed Akorn's annual audits and quarterly reviews.  McConville attended meetings
with Deloitte before Deloitte began its field work; at these meetings, Deloitte reviewed the
proposed scope of the audit and projected time frames.  During the course of the field work,
which Deloitte completed on February 23, 2001, McConville was generally available for
discussions with Deloitte.  She attended the meetings at the end of the field work at which
Deloitte discussed its findings.  She also attended audit committee meetings, which were held at

       McConville had begun preparation of Akorn's 2000 Form 10-K while serving as CFO.  
She wrote a press release, dated February 20, 2001, that announced Akorn's fourth-quarter results
and provided year-end net income and sales figures.  During February and early March, she
reviewed drafts of the 2000 financial statements.  21/   The financial statements included the

       Form 10-K as CFO.  Additionally, McConville's expert witness testified that McConville
       "performed her normal procedures as a reviewer of the draft financial statements in
       February" and that "she had seen drafts of the financial statements prior to her demotion"
                                                                                  (continued...)

numbers for year-end 2000 from the February 20 press release that McConville had authored.  By
March 20, McConville's last day as CFO, the financial statements to be included in the Form 10-
K were largely completed,  22/ and a draft of the Form 10-K had already been prepared.  The
filing of the Form 10-K was delayed, however, while Akorn sought to resolve the questions
raised by The Northern Trust Company. 

       On approximately April 17, 2001, McConville was asked to sign, and did sign, two
management representation letters, as corporate controller, in connection with Deloitte's annual
audit of the financial statements filed with the 2000 Form 10-K.  The first letter, dated February
23, 2001, stated that it was provided in connection with Deloitte's audit of Akorn's consolidated
balance sheets as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the related consolidated statements of
income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2000.  The letter represented that, to the best of the knowledge and belief of those
signing,

21/    (...continued)
       (from the position of CFO).  Although McConville testified at the hearing that she no
       longer believed that she had reviewed a draft of the financial statements, the record
       supports the conclusion that she did review a draft.  Moreover, the law judge, who had a
       chance to observe McConville's demeanor at the hearing, cited her denial that she
       reviewed the Form 10-K as one of a number of instances where McConville was not
       credible.  The credibility determination of an initial fact finder is entitled to considerable
       weight and deference because it is based on hearing the witnesses' testimony and
       observing their demeanor.  See, e.g., Daniel Joseph Alderman, 52 S.E.C. 366, 368 (1995),
       aff'd, 104 F.3d 285 (9th Cir. 1997); Jonathan Garrett Ornstein, 51 S.E.C. 135, 137 (1992). 

       McConville contends that the law judge's determination that she reviewed a draft of the
       Form 10-K is clearly erroneous "because it has no basis in evidence and is the product of
       an impermissible inference drawn from Kevin Harris' Answer to the [Order Instituting
       Proceedings ("OIP)]."  This characterization of the law judge's finding is inaccurate.  In
       concluding that McConville reviewed a draft of the Form 10-K, the law judge cited,
       quoted from, and discussed both McConville's investigative testimony that she believed
       she had reviewed a draft of the Form 10-K and the testimony of McConville's expert
       witness, as noted above.  The law judge's reference to Harris's Answer was not in
       connection with her finding that McConville reviewed a draft of the Form 10-K, but
       rather in connection with her finding that McConville had significant responsibility for it. 
       Based on our de novo review of material in the record other than Harris's Answer, and
       including the law judge's credibility determination, we find that McConville reviewed a
       draft of the Form 10-K.

       subsequently added.

       The second letter, dated April 17, 2001, represented that, to the best of the knowledge and
belief of the signers,

       (1)  Other than the events described in paragraph 4 of Note G [relating to an April 6, 2001
       amendment of the revolving credit agreement with The Northern Trust Co.], there are no
       events which have occurred subsequent to February 23, 2001 that have a material effect
       on the financial statements that are in the filing or that should be disclosed in order to
       keep those statements from being misleading.

       On April 17, 2001, Akorn filed the 2000 Form 10-K in which, as noted above, it reported
net income of $2,187,000 and current assets of $42,123,000.  Akorn's current assets included
$24,144,000 of "trade accounts receivable (less allowance for uncollectibles of [$801,000])."  23/ 
Although sales to the top five wholesaler customers accounted for approximately 60% of Akorn's
gross accounts receivable, the allowance for uncollectible accounts did not include any amount
related to those customers.  Moreover, the Form 10-K did not note any impairment of the
receivables.  Deloitte understood from McConville and others in Akorn management that the top
five wholesaler customers did not present a collection risk because they had both the ability and
the intent to pay.  In the Independent Auditors' Report, which was included in the Form 10-K,
Deloitte repeated the assertion from the February 23, 2001 management representation letter that
the consolidated financial statements presented Akorn's financial position fairly, in conformity
with GAAP.  Deloitte issued an unqualified opinion as to the financials that were part of Akorn's
Form 10-K for 2000.  24/ 

23/    Akorn appears to have used the terms "allowance for uncollectibles" and "allowance for
       doubtful accounts" interchangeably.  As indicated above, the allowance was reflected on
       the financial statements as a reduction of the accounts receivable balance; it thus directly
       affected Akorn's total assets.

24/    McConville did not sign the 2000 Form 10-K.

       On May 22, 2001, slightly more than a month after filing the Form 10-K, Akorn filed its
quarterly report, Form 10-Q, for the quarter ended March 31, 2001.  In its Form 10-Q, Akorn
increased its allowance for doubtful accounts by $7,520,000.  On October 7, 2002, Akorn
restated its financial statements for 2000 and 2001 by filing a Form 10-K/A.  The Form 10-K/A
stated that Akorn "had not adequately considered all of the information available with respect to
certain disputed receivables in establishing its allowance for uncollectible accounts as of
December 31, 2000," that the $7,520,000 increase in its allowance for doubtful accounts should
have been recorded at year end 2000 rather than in the first quarter of 2001, and that the bad debt
expense in the 2000 financial statement was understated by a corresponding amount.  As a result
of these adjustments, Akorn's restated financials for 2000 reported a net loss of $2.4 million, or
$0.13 per share. 

                                               III.

A.     McConville violated Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.

       Exchange Act Section 10(b) makes it unlawful "for any person, directly or indirectly, by
the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce or the mails, . . . [t]o use or
employ, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security . . . any manipulative or deceptive
device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission may
prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors." 
Rule 10b-5 prohibits fraud, misleading statements or omissions, and any act, practice or course of
business that operates as a fraud "in connection with the purchase or sale of any security."  To
establish a violation of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, it must be shown that a person acted with
scienter, or "a mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud."  25/  Reckless
behavior satisfies the scienter requirement.  26/

       1.      Akorn's 2000 Form 10-K contained materially misleading statements and
               omissions.

       The financial statements in Akorn's 2000 Form 10-K overstated Akorn's accounts
receivable and current assets because its allowance for doubtful accounts did not include any
amounts for Akorn's five largest wholesale customers.  Additionally, the balance sheet 
overstated Akorn's accounts receivable, which represented 57% of Akorn's current assets, by
failing to note the likelihood of a loss contingency.  27/

27/    We do not base our findings as to McConville's liability on the February 20, 2001 press
       release, even though the press release contained figures that were incorporated into the
                                                                                    (continued...)

                                               13

       As noted above, Akorn's current assets as reported in the 2000 Form 10-K included
accounts receivable of approximately $24 million, with 60% of its gross accounts receivable
attributable to the top five wholesale customers.  With a sum of approximately $5 million to be
reconciled between Akorn and Cardinal alone, and with ample evidence that Akorn would not be
able to collect on the entire amount it believed it was due, the amounts at issue were material.  
The material overstatements rendered the financial statements materially false and misleading.
  
       The statement in the Form 10-K that the financial statements were prepared in accordance
with GAAP was also materially false and misleading.  GAAP includes Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards Number 5 ("FAS 5"), which deals with accounting for contingencies. 
Under FAS 5, a loss contingency is defined as "an existing condition, situation, or set of
circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible . . . loss . . . to an enterprise that will
ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur."  28/  Collectibility
of receivables is given as an example of a loss contingency.  29/  FAS 5, paragraph 8, provides
that an estimated loss from a loss contingency must be accrued by a charge to income if two
conditions are met:

       a.      Information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it
               is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the
               date of the financial statements.  It is implicit in this condition that it must be
               probable that one or more future events will occur confirming the fact of the loss.

       b.      The amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.  30/

If information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable
that an asset has been impaired (satisfying paragraph 8(a)), but the amount of the loss cannot be
reasonably estimated (as required by paragraph 8(b)), FAS 5 paragraph 10 requires that
"disclosure of the contingency shall be made when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a

loss . . . may have been incurred."  31/  "Reasonably possible" is defined as meaning that "[t]he
chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely."  32/

       Information available before the financial statements were issued on April 17, 2001
demonstrated that it was not only reasonably possible, but probable, that Akorn would fail to
collect 100% of the receivables from its top five wholesale customers.  33/  Akorn's accounting
records as to accounts receivable were in a shambles.  Akorn management knew that the 
receivables were increasingly growing more aged, but it lacked the detailed, accurate reports that
would permit a thorough analysis of aging.  Akorn was unable to tell which invoices had been
paid (or offset by credits), so it could not convincingly demonstrate to its customers what
payment was still owed.  Because Akorn had not monitored accounts receivable properly for
years, it was not able to provide proofs of delivery for some shipments.  Akorn knew that
reconciling its accounts receivable would be an enormous task.  And it knew that the one
customer account that it had most thoroughly reviewed, the Cardinal account, still presented
significant obstacles to collection, with Cardinal contesting approximately $5 million of the
amount Akorn claimed was owing.  Thus, even if the amount of loss could not reasonably be
estimated by April 17, the likelihood that complete collection would not be possible was
sufficiently great that impairment should have been indicated.  Because no such impairment was
noted, the financial statements were not in accordance with GAAP.  34/  Moreover, the failure to
disclose that the receivables were impaired was an omission of a material fact necessary to
ensure that the figures in the financial statements were not misleading. 

       2.     McConville is liable for the material misrepresentations and omission in Akorn's
              2000 Form 10-K.

       McConville, as CFO, (working with Costello as controller) oversaw the drafting of the
2000 Form 10-K, and reviewed a draft of the Form 10-K that was virtually identical to the 2000
Form 10-K that Akorn filed with the Commission, which incorporated the fourth-quarter and
year-end results that she included in the February 20, 2001 press release that she authored.  She
also knew that Akorn's allowance for doubtful, or uncollectible, accounts as reported in the Form

31/    Id., vol. I, 35-36 (footnote omitted) (FAS 5 par. 10).

32/    Id., vol. I, 34 (FAS 5 par. 3(b)).

33/    FAS 5 states that a future event is "probable" if it is "likely to occur."

34/    McConville argues that she did not have adequate notice that the Division's allegations
       regarding GAAP violations were based on an omitted disclosure concerning Akorn's
       chargeback and rebate reserves.  Since we do not base our finding on this theory, we need
       not reach this issue.  We note, however, that the OIP is replete with references to Akorn's
       accounts receivable records, and that the treatment of chargebacks and rebates is an
       aspect of Akorn's accounts receivable accounting.
---------------------Page 15---------------------

                                              15

10-K did not contain any reserve with respect to Akorn's five largest customers, and that the
Form 10-K omitted to disclose any impairment of the accounts receivable.  McConville signed
the management representation letters reassuring Deloitte that the financial statements were in
accordance with GAAP and that, with one exception not relevant here,  35/  no events had
occurred subsequent to February 23, 2001 that had a material effect on the financial statements
that are in the filing or that should be disclosed in order to keep those statements from being
misleading.  At the time she signed the letters, McConville knew, or was reckless in not
knowing, that the statements in those letters were false,  36/ and that Deloitte would rely on them
in issuing the audit opinion that was included in the Form 10-K.

       Well before the filing of the Form 10-K on April 17, 2001 McConville knew that Akorn's
accounts receivables accounting was in terrible disarray.  Akorn's adoption of the Macola and
J.D. Edwards software packages happened during McConville's tenure as CFO.  She was aware
that there were accounts receivable records on each of those systems, and that Macola ran into
problems and would not function when processing transactions that involved large volumes of
data.  She knew that Akorn invoices were lengthy, that remittances were not matched with
invoices, and that it was impossible to determine aging patterns accurately.  She knew from
Deloitte's February 25, 2000 report that Deloitte was concerned about management's failure to
review the accounts receivable in detail, misapplication of credits and payments to customer
accounts, and failure to collect on outstanding balances effectively and efficiently.  She also
knew that management had undertaken to achieve "significant collection resolution by June 30,
2000 and complete cleanup by August 31, 2000," and she knew that these goals were not
accomplished.  McConville further knew that as sales were growing, the distribution of the aging
of receivables was getting older, and that during 2000, an increasingly large dollar amount was
going uncollected for an increasingly long time.  37/  McConville knew that her February 2001

35/    The subsequent event noted in the April 17 letter was the April 16, 2001 amendment of
       Akorn's revolving credit agreement with The Northern Trust Company.

36/    The record does not address whether McConville reviewed the draft Form 10-K at the
       time she signed the representation letters, or at any time after she reviewed the draft that 
       incorporated the erroneous numbers from the February press release.  Given the
       assurances about the financial statements provided in those letters, however, it was at
       least reckless if McConville did not actually review the documents about which she was
       making representations.

37/    The law judge found McConville's assertion that she did not remember exactly when
       Akorn's board became concerned about the increased aging of the receivables not
       credible, since she was responsible for reporting Akorn's financial results to the board
       and, in 1999 and 2000, Akorn's accounts receivable were increasing at a much faster rate
       than sales.  McConville also prepared the management response to the concerns about
       accounts receivable expressed by Deloitte in its February 25, 2000 report to Akorn's
                                                                                   (continued...)

meeting with Cardinal resulted in payment by Cardinal of only $913,745 (at a time when she
believed that Cardinal owed Akorn approximately $4 million), that after paying the $913,745
Cardinal considered that it was in a credit position with Akorn, and that Akorn's records were in
such disarray that Akorn would be unlikely to be able to provide proofs of delivery to
substantiate at least some of the allegedly unpaid invoices. 
 
       McConville knew that, in part because of computer problems and the volume of
paperwork involved, reconciling the accounts receivable would be a monumental task. 
Moreover, after her February meeting with Cardinal and Cardinal's response, she knew or was
reckless in not knowing that Akorn was not going to be able to collect the entire amount Akorn
believed was due from Cardinal and Akorn's other top wholesale customers, and that the failure
to collect would adversely impact Akorn's financial statements.  Given this knowledge, we find
that McConville acted with scienter in connection with her involvement in the preparation and
filing of the 2000 Form 10-K.  38/

       3.     McConville's misstatements and omissions were "in connection with" the
              purchase or sale of a security, and the misstatements were made by jurisdictional
              means.

       The filing of false or misleading Forms 10-K with the Commission satisfies the
requirement that misstatements or omissions be made "in connection with" the purchase or sale

37/    (...continued)
       board.  We find that McConville, who attended both board and audit committee meetings,
       was aware of those concerns well before the 2000 Form 10-K was filed. 

38/    McConville argues that the alleged misstatements in the Form 10-K are opinion
       statements and as such are protected by the "bespeaks caution" doctrine.  We assume
       McConville is relying on the cautionary language contained in Note A to the 2000 Form
       10-K, which generally states that the preparation of financial statements requires
       management to use estimates and assumptions and that actual results could differ
       materially from estimates.  (McConville cites Note G on page 30 of the Form 10-K, but
       this reference appears to have been an error on her part because Note G, which refers to
       covenants involved in a revolving credit agreement, is irrelevant to the issues in this
       case.)  The "bespeaks caution" doctrine does not permit a company to avoid Rule 10b-5
       liability by the insertion of "boilerplate" cautionary language, like that contained in Note
       A, into a filing.  See, e.g.,  In re Trump Casino Sec. Litig., 7 F.3d 357, 371-72 (3d Cir.
       1993) (boilerplate disclaimer that merely warns that investment has risks will ordinarily
       be inadequate to prevent misinformation; instead, cautionary statements must be
       substantive and tailored to specific future projections, estimates, or opinions challenged). 
       Moreover, many of the material misstatements in the Form 10-K are statements of fact
       rather than opinion, including statements of the Company's annual net sales, net income,
       and year-end accounts receivable.  
---------------------Page 17---------------------

                                               17

of a security.  39/   McConville argues, however, that her involvement in the preparation of the
financial statements contained in the Form 10-K was not sufficiently "in connection with" the
purchase or sale of a security.  McConville argues that statements made to auditors "that might
eventually find their way into a document distributed to investors" do not satisfy the "in
connection with" requirement. 
 
       McConville misperceives the basis of her liability.  Her liability under Section 10(b) and
Rule 10b-5 is not based on statements to auditors that unexpectedly ended up in documents
distributed to investors; it is based on misstatements and omissions in the financial statements
contained in the 2000 Form 10-K filed with the Commission, which she was involved in drafting
and reviewing.  40/  McConville prepared the press release containing the year-end figures that
were included in the financial statements contained in the 2000 Form 10-K.  She reviewed a draft
of the financial statements as part of the drafting of the 2000 Form 10-K; this draft was virtually
identical to the financial statements that were ultimately filed with the Commission.  Between
March and the April 17 filing of the Form 10-K, her substantial work on the reconciliation of the
Cardinal account informed her that a significant portion of Cardinal's receivables would not be
collectible.  She signed the management representation letters relied on by Deloitte stating that
the financial statements were in accordance with GAAP and that no events had transpired that
would require adjustments or disclosures in the financial statements.  This involvement in the
dissemination of false and misleading information to investors was sufficient to satisfy the "in
connection with" requirement. 

       In a similar vein, McConville argues that the violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5
charged were not established because the record does not show that any of her misleading
statements to Deloitte were made by the use of jurisdictional means.  However, as discussed
above, the misleading statements for purposes of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 are not
misstatements to Deloitte, but rather misstatements and omissions in the financial statements
contained in the 2000 Form 10-K, which was filed with the Commission by electronic filing,

through telephone lines or otherwise across state lines using interstate commerce.  Thus, the
requirement of use of jurisdictional means was satisfied.  41/

B.     McConville violated Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Rule 13b2-1.

       Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) provides, in relevant part, that "[n]o person shall
knowingly circumvent or knowingly fail to implement a system of internal accounting controls or
knowingly falsify any book, record, or account" described in Section 13(b)(2).  Rule 13b2-1
makes it unlawful for a person, directly or indirectly, to falsify or cause to be falsified any book,
record, or account subject to Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(A).  Scienter is not required for a
finding of violation of Rule 13b2-1.  42/

       As discussed above, Akorn's internal controls fell far short of what would have been
necessary for the preparation of accurate financial statements.  McConville's tenure as CFO
encompassed the period during which Akorn adopted first the Macola, then the J.D. Edwards
software programs.  She was well aware of the shortcomings of these programs and of the
complexity and difficulty of accurately aging the accounts receivable and reconciling Akorn's
accounts receivables records with its customers' accounts payable records.  Thus, McConville
knew that Akorn did not have a system of internal accounting controls for its accounts receivable
necessary for the preparation of accurate financial statements and knowingly failed to implement
such a system, in violation of Section 13(b)(5).  Moreover, by failing to correct those
shortcomings, McConville caused the falsification of Akorn's records, in violation of Rule 
13b2-1.  43/

41/    McConville does not deny that numerous cases find liability under Section 10(b) and
       Rule 10b-5 against persons who did not personally "push the button" to transmit a filing
       to the Commission.  See, e.g., Rana Research, 8 F.3d 1358 (consultant liable under
       Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 for misrepresentations in press release that was transmitted
       by facsimile by office manager).  She contends, however, that those cases do not present a
       finding of violation by a person who "properly objects" to the failure of proof that he or
       she used jurisdictional means in the manner prescribed by Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. 
       We cannot discern from the opinions in question whether an objection to the use of
       jurisdictional means was raised during those proceedings.  The cases hold that liability
       attaches against persons whose involvement was comparable to McConville's.

42/    SEC v. McNulty, 137 F.3d 732, 740-41 (2d Cir. 1988).

43/    McConville argues that Section 13(b)(5) is silent as to the quality or characteristics of the
       system of internal accounting controls required and that the standard required under
       Section 13(b)(2) is inapplicable.  McConville cites no authority, and we are aware of
       none, for the proposition that the term "internal accounting controls" means one thing in
       one subsection of the statute and something else in another subsection.  
                                                                                   (continued...)

C.     McConville caused Akorn to violate Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2).

       Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(A) requires, among other things, that every issuer of
securities registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12 make and keep books, records,
and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the issuer.  Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(B) requires, in relevant
part, that every such issuer of securities devise and maintain a system of internal accounting
controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and to maintain
accountability for assets.  Scienter need not be shown to establish liability under Section
13(b)(2).  44/ 

       As discussed above, Akorn's accounts receivable records did not accurately show what
invoices had been paid or what amounts were still owing on particular invoices and therefore did
not accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of Akorn's assets.  The financial
statements filed with the 2000 Form 10-K materially overstated Akorn's assets because of the
failure to include in the allowance for doubtful accounts anything for the five largest wholesale
customer accounts.  Additionally, as we have already found, the financial statements in the 2000
Form 10-K were not in accordance with GAAP because they failed to disclose the impairment of
the accounts receivable.  The inaccuracies in the accounts receivable were due to Akorn's
inadequate internal controls, as discussed above.  Akorn violated Section 13(b)(2) by failing to
keep records that accurately and fairly reflected the transactions and dispositions of its assets, and
by failing to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances that transactions were recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets. 

       McConville can be found to have caused Akorn's violations of Section 13(b)(2) if she was
responsible for an act or omission that she knew or should have known would contribute to the
violation.  45/  As discussed above, McConville knew or was reckless in not knowing that her

43/    (...continued)
       McConville also argues she cannot be found to have falsified any book or record for
       purposes of Rule 13b2-1 because she made no entries in Akorn's ledgers and did not
       know how to make entries into Akorn's computerized accounting system.   Rule 13b2-1
       does not limit liability to those who directly falsify books and records; it allows persons
       to be held liable for having indirectly falsified, or caused to be falsified, books and
       records.  McConville's failure to implement a system of internal controls to ensure that
       transactions were properly recorded establishes her violation of the rule.

failure to implement more adequate internal controls would result in inaccuracies in Akorn's
books and records, and we thus find that McConville caused Akorn's violations of Section
13(b)(2).  46/ 

       McConville contends that Akorn's books, records, and accounts satisfied Section
13(b)(2)(A) because they did reflect the transactions and dispositions of Akorn's assets "in
reasonable detail," as the statute requires.  She contends that the evidence does not show any
deliberate falsification of accounting entries; she argues that at most, it shows that Akorn's
bookkeepers did not fully process remittance advices on as timely a basis as was desirable and
that the accounts receivable personnel were less diligent than was desirable in pursuing
collections.

       We reject McConville's characterization of the evidence.  The magnitude of the problem
went far beyond the description she offers.  As Maire noted, problems with Akorn's accounts
receivable had been accumulating over a three- to four-year period, with "pages and pages of A/R
reports" on each of the top five wholesaler accounts, consisting of a "maze of transactions" 
going back as far as 1996.  This description is not one of books and records that accurately reflect
transactions and disposition of assets "in reasonable detail."

       McConville argues that the GAAP violation charged was "wholly unrelated to Akorn's
internal accounting controls" because "the propriety of disclosure [of the impairment of
receivables] and creation of additional reserves would turn on a judgment call as to whether
Akorn's customers would duly pay submitted invoices," a judgment as to which, she contends,
internal controls are irrelevant.  We disagree.  Any "judgment call" that Akorn might make about
whether its customers would pay must depend heavily on the quality of the information on which
the judgment is based.  The quality of that information depended, in turn, on its internal controls.  
If Akorn did not know how much of which invoices remained unpaid, it was in a poor position to
judge how much it was likely to collect.  Moreover, the question whether customers could be
expected to pay invoices depends in significant part on how well substantiated those invoices

       Docket 851, 859-60.  Contrary to McConville's argument, the Division was not required
       to prove that her conduct was a proximate cause of the violations.

46/     McConville argues that Costello, or persons who reported to Costello, were responsible
       for the making and keeping of Akorn's books and records and that McConville therefore
       cannot be held liable for the violations of Section 13(b)(2)(A) charged.  But Costello
       reported to McConville, and McConville testified that she "indirectly . . . was responsible
       for supervising the day-to-day financial operations of the company."  Having taken on
       these responsibilities, McConville cannot evade the consequences of her failure to fulfill
       them appropriately.

were.  If Akorn could not match payments or credits to invoices in order to prove how much was
due, and if it could not produce on demand proof of delivery, then it could not expect customers
to pay.  Additionally, older invoices may be more difficult to collect.  The inadequacy of Akorn's
internal controls made it impossible to track the aging of receivables in detail and therefore were
not sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that transactions were recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and to maintain
accountability for assets, as required by Section 13(b)(2).  47/

D.     McConville violated Rule 13b2-2.

       Rule 13b2-2, in relevant part, makes it unlawful for an officer of an issuer to make or
cause to be made a materially false or misleading statement to an accountant or omit or cause
another person to omit any material information necessary to make the statements made not
misleading in connection with an audit of financial statements or reports filed with the
Commission.  The term "officer" includes a "comptroller or principal accounting officer, and any
person routinely performing corresponding functions with respect to any organization whether
incorporated or unincorporated."  48/  We have already found that the management
representation letters signed by McConville and addressed to Deloitte contained false statements
about the conformity of the financial statements with GAAP, the adequacy of the allowance for
uncollectible accounts receivable, and the lack of need for further disclosures.  We also find that
McConville falsely represented to Deloitte that indications were positive in terms of receivables
and that there was little past due money owing from wholesalers because most of the old bills

47/    McConville argues that, if the financial statements in the 2000 Form 10-K did not
       conform to GAAP because of failure to disclose an impairment of Akorn's receivables,
       the GAAP violation was "not caused by deficiencies in Akorn's internal controls," but
       rather "caused by a failure of Akorn's accountants to assure that the potential impact of
       the shortcomings in Akorn's internal controls was properly disclosed."  McConville's
       argument would recast Section 13(b)(2)(B) as a statute about disclosure and shift the
       blame to Akorn's auditors.  Neither argument is persuasive.  Section 13(b)(2)(B) is about
       the adequacy of internal accounting controls.  The conduct of Akorn's auditors is not at
       issue in this proceeding. 

       McConville contends that Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2) is unconstitutionally vague,
       citing SEC v. World-Wide Coin Investments, Ltd., 567 F.Supp. 724, 751 (N.D. Ga.
       1983), a case that, in relevant part, concerns the applicability of the internal control
       provisions of Section 13(b)(2)(B).  World-Wide Coin does not address whether Section
       13(b)(2)(B) is unconstitutionally vague.  It simply states that "[a]ny ruling by a court with
       respect to the applicability of both the accounting provisions and the internal accounting
       control provisions should be strictly limited to the facts of each case."  We have engaged
       in precisely that type of fact-sensitive analysis here.

were offset by more recent credits.  By making these false representations to Deloitte,
McConville violated Rule 13b2-2. 

       McConville contends that she cannot be liable for the violation of Rule 13b2-2 because at
the time of the alleged misstatements she was Akorn's "Corporate Controller," not its
"comptroller."   The securities laws are to be construed broadly to effectuate their remedial 
purpose.  49/  "Controller" and "comptroller" may be used interchangeably to describe the
position in an agency or organization with oversight responsibilities for the agency's or
organization's primary accounting functions.  50/  McConville's responsibilities, insofar as they
related to the signing of the management representation letters, were commensurate with those of
an officer.  51/

E.     McConville caused Akorn to violate Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and
       12b-20.

       Section 13(a) and Rule 13a-1 require the filing of annual reports with the Commission. 
The contents of those reports must be complete and accurate.  52/   Rule 12b-20 mandates that
periodic reports contain such further material information as may be necessary to make the
required statements not misleading.  53/  

       We have already found that Akorn's 2000 Form 10-K was inaccurate in that the current
assets were materially overstated and that the impairment of the receivables should have been,
but was not, disclosed.  For the reasons set forth in finding that McConville violated Section
10(b), we find that she caused Akorn to violate Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 12b-20.

F.     McConville's procedural arguments are without merit.

       McConville makes two related arguments that her due process rights were violated
because she did not have adequate notice of the charges against her.  First, she argues that the law
judge erred in refusing to grant her motion for a more definite statement.  Second, she claims
that, because the law judge denied her motion to strike evidence and proffered findings relating
to Akorn's chargeback and rebate reserves, the Division was able to present evidence outside the
scope of the OIP of which she did not have notice.  These arguments are without merit.

       Our rules require that the OIP set forth the factual and legal basis alleged for the order "in
such detail as will permit a specific response thereto."  54/  The OIP must inform the respondent
of the charges in enough detail to allow the respondent to prepare a defense, but it need not
disclose to the respondent the evidence upon which the Division intends to rely.  55/  

       The OIP in this proceeding alleged facts regarding McConville's employment at Akorn,
her knowledge regarding deficiencies and problems related to Akorn's accounts receivable
records, her review of the 2000 Form 10-K, the failure to create a reserve for Akorn's largest
customer accounts receivable, her false statements in the management representation letters, her
failure to make certain disclosures regarding accounts receivable to Akorn's auditors, the increase
in the reserve for doubtful accounts in the 10-Q for the first quarter of 2001, and the statutes and
rules violated.   The OIP also put McConville on notice that Akorn's accounting for chargebacks
and rebates would be an issue in the proceeding.  56/  The OIP thus satisfied the due process
requirement that a respondent be given fair notice of the claims lodged and the grounds upon
which those claims rest, and the law judge did not err in denying her motion.  57/

       McConville makes several additional unsubstantial procedural arguments.  For example,
McConville argues that, because Commission sanctions are quasi-criminal, the Division was 

54/    Rule of Practice 200(b)(3), 17 C.F.R. § 201.200(b)(3).

       McConville does not dispute that she had access to the Division's investigatory record,
       which provided information about the evidence on which the Division intended to rely.

56/    See supra note 33. 

57/    See, e.g., Jaffee & Co. v. SEC, 446 F.2d 387, 394 (2d Cir. 1971).  McConville complains
       that the law judge denied her motion before considering her reply memorandum.  The law
       judge reconsidered her ruling after considering McConville's reply and the cases cited
       therein.  She then denied McConville's  motion.  McConville does not identify any
       prejudice that resulted from the law judge's ruling, and we see none.  
---------------------Page 24---------------------

required to prove its case by clear and convincing evidence.  Under Steadman v. SEC it is well
settled that the applicable standard, which we applied here,  is preponderance of the 
evidence.  58/ 

       McConville asserts that the Commission's settled administrative proceeding against
Costello, who served as Akorn's controller during much of McConville's tenure as CFO,
collaterally estops the Commission from finding that she committed the violations charged
because the order in that proceeding found that Costello had significant responsibility for the
preparation and contents of Akorn's 2000 Form 10-K.  59/   The doctrine of collateral estoppel
protects litigants from relitigating an identical issue with the same party.  60/  The question
whether McConville had significant responsibility for preparing the 2000 Form 10-K is not
identical to the question whether Costello also had significant responsibility for that document,
so it is not being relitigated here.  61/

       McConville argues that the amended financial statements for fiscal year 2000 contained
in the Form 10-K/A filed by Akorn on October 7, 2002 "represent the only concrete evidence of a
quantifiable deficiency in the reserve for doubtful accounts" in Akorn's 2000 Form 10-K, and that
"to the extent the Initial Decision suggests that such a quantifiable deficiency existed on April 17,
2001, that suggestion rests on the erroneous admission of prior sworn testimony -- the Form 10-
K/A -- representing an official change in Akorn's position into which McConville had no input." 
She goes on to argue that, insofar as the Form 10-K/A represented prior sworn testimony, its
admission was governed by our Rule 235; that the requirements of Rule 235 were not satisfied;
and that the admission of the Form 10-K/A therefore "violated McConville's Sixth Amendment
rights."    

       McConville's argument is flawed in many respects.  To the extent the law judge made
"suggestions," such "suggestions" are now irrelevant in light of our de novo review.  62/  We see

61/    McConville argues that the law judge "turned the principle of collateral estoppel on its
       head" and used the Costello order improperly against her.   The import of this argument is
       unclear, but in any event, our de novo review would cure any error of this nature.

62/    In a further argument of this nature, McConville contends that the law judge relied on
       facts and arguments not explicitly identified in the Initial Decision.  McConville fails to
       identify any portions of the Initial Decision that the law judge failed to support with
                                                                                   (continued...)

nothing in the Initial Decision that suggests that the law judge based any conclusions on a finding
that there was a quantifiable deficiency in the reserve for doubtful accounts as of April 17, 2001. 
We make no such finding, and we base no conclusion on any such finding.  None of the numbers
contained in the Form 10-K/A are the basis for any finding against McConville.  We do not find
that the amount of uncollectible receivables could be quantified by April 17; we find, however,
that McConville knew or was reckless in not knowing that it was likely that Akorn would fail to
collect a substantial amount of the receivables from the top five wholesale customers.  In any
event, Rule 235 is irrelevant to the admission of the Form 10-K/A, a filing with the Commission,
and compliance with the requirements of Rule 235 is consequently irrelevant.  The Sixth
Amendment is irrelevant to non-criminal proceedings.  63/

       Exchange Act Section 21C authorizes the Commission, where there is a finding that a
person has violated or caused a violation of a provision of the Exchange Act or any rule
thereunder, to order such person to cease and desist from committing or causing such violation
and any future violation of the same provision or rule.  64/  In determining whether a cease-and-
desist order is an appropriate sanction, we look to the risk of future violations and a variety of
other factors, including the seriousness of the violation, the isolated or recurrent nature of the
violation, whether the violation is recent, the degree of harm to investors or the marketplace
resulting from the violation, the respondent's state of mind, the sincerity of assurances against
future violations, recognition of the wrongful nature of the conduct, opportunity to commit future

62/    (...continued)
       references to specified facts.  But again, any errors of this sort in the Initial Decision are
       of no consequence since our review is de novo.

63/    McConville argues that the law judge improperly quashed her subpoena requiring the
       Commission to produce certain materials related to its dealings with Akorn leading to the
       filing of the Form 10-K/A.  As noted above, however, none of the numbers in the Form
       10-K/A are the basis for any finding against McConville.

       salary she received from Akorn in 2000 and 2001.  Although we believe that imposing
       disgorgement of salary is within our authority, as an exercise of discretion, we decline to
       do so here.  

       Our resolution of this matter makes it unnecessary to reach the question of McConville's
       alleged inability to pay disgorgement.  McConville submitted a Form D-A, containing
       personal financial information.  We grant her unopposed motion pursuant to Rule of
       Practice 322(b), 17 C.F.R. § 201.322(b), for a protective order for the financial
       information contained in this Form, based on our finding that the harm to McConville
       resulting from disclosure would outweigh the benefits of disclosure.

violations, and remedial function to be served by the cease-and-desist order in the context of any
other sanctions sought in the proceeding.  65/  We impose a cease-and-desist order only where
we have determined that there is some risk of future violation.  66/

       The violations here were significant.  McConville was responsible for misrepresentations
and omissions in Akorn's Form 10-K, which was filed with the Commission and thus made
available to investors.  As a result of the deficiencies in Akorn's recordkeeping and internal
controls, Akorn's receivables were overstated, no impairment of the receivables was disclosed,
and no reserve was created for customer accounts that represented 60% of the receivables. 
McConville made misrepresentations to Deloitte in the management representation letters to
Deloitte, knowing that Deloitte would be basing assumptions on those letters in its work on the
2000 audit.  She also made oral misrepresentations to Deloitte about the collectibility of the
receivables from the top five wholesale customers.
 
       The deficiencies of Akorn's recordkeeping with regard to accounts receivable was an
ongoing problem, not a one-time or limited occurrence.  The situation deteriorated for months, if
not years, and McConville failed to take adequate action to improve matters.  The violations were
relatively recent:  the deficiencies in internal controls became more pronounced over the years
and came to a head in 2000 and early 2001, and McConville signed the management
representation letters in 2001, and the 2000 Form 10-K was filed in 2001.  

       McConville's actions caused harm to investors and the marketplace.  Fraudulent
misstatements and omissions in financial statements and periodic reports mislead investors who
buy or sell stock based on the information contained therein.  Moreover, exposure of the fraud
results in an erosion of confidence in the marketplace in general.  67/ 
 
       As we found above, McConville acted with scienter.  McConville continues to deny
responsibility for the violations charged, and does not acknowledge any wrongdoing on her part. 
Her primary assurance that she will not commit future violations is based on the fact that the
bringing of this proceeding against her has damaged her reputation to such an extent that it is
unlikely that she will be hired for a position where she could commit such violations.  However,

65/    KPMG Peat Marwick, 54 S.E.C. 1134, 1192 (2001), reconsideration denied, 74 SEC
       Docket 1351 (Mar. 8, 2001), pet. for review denied, 289 F.3d 109 (D.C. Cir. 2002). 

66/    KPMG Peat Marwick, 54 S.E.C. at 1185.  The risk of future violations required to
       support a cease-and-desist order is significantly less than that required for an injunction. 
       Id. at 1191.

67/    See, e.g., SEC v. Dresser Indus., Inc., 628 F.2d 1368, 1377 (D.C. Cir. 1980)
       (dissemination of false or misleading information by companies to members of investing
       public may distort efficient workings of securities markets and injure investors who rely
       on the accuracy and completeness of companys public disclosures).

merely instituting a proceeding does not preclude future employment in the securities industry. 
A cease-and-desist order will serve the remedial purpose of encouraging McConville to take her
responsibilities more seriously in the future.  68/  We find that the record as a whole, especially
the evidence with regard to the seriousness of McConville's violations and her lack of
acknowledgement of wrongdoing, establishes a sufficient risk that McConville would commit
future violations to warrant imposition of a cease-and-desist order.   Based on all of these factors,
we find a cease-and-desist order to be in the public interest.  69/

68/    See McCurdy v. SEC, 396 F.3d 1258, 1265 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (recognizing that order
       suspending auditor from practice before the Commission for one year had remedial
       purpose of encouraging more rigorous compliance with generally accepted auditing
       standards in future).

69/    McConville suggests that under Section 21C of the Exchange Act, the Commission may
       not enter a cease-and-desist order against McConville because the OIP did not also charge
       Akorn, the primary violator.  McConville argues that Section 21C's use of the singular
       "an order" indicates that cease-and-desist orders are permitted only where such an order
       also is entered against the primary violator.

       The Commission has never construed Section 21C as having such a requirement.  See,
       e.g. Robert M. Fuller, 80 SEC Docket 3539 (entering cease-and-desist order for causing
       violations of primary violator, where no cease-and-desist order was imposed on primary
       violator).  To the contrary, the language in Section 21C providing that the Commission
       "may" enter a cease-and-desist order against a primary violator and against a person that
       is a cause of the violation supports our view that the Commission has the option of
       entering a cease-and-desist order against an individual who causes a violation without
       entering the same order against the primary violator.

70/    We have considered all of the parties' contentions.  We have rejected or sustained them to
       the extent that they are inconsistent or in accord with the views expressed in this opinion.
