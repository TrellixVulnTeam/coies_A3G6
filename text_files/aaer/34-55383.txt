A. R    ELEVANT ENTITIES 

       1.     Kmart Corporation (“Kmart” or the “company”) 

       Kmart was a Michigan Corporation headquartered in Troy, Michigan, during the relevant 
period. On January 22, 2002, Kmart filed a voluntary petition for reorganization relief under 
Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy code.  The company’s common stock was registered with the 
Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78l(b)] and traded on the 
New York Stock Exchange until December 19, 2002, when trading was suspended.  Kmart’s fiscal 
year ends the last Wednesday in January. 
       2.     Coca Cola Enterprises Inc. (“CCE”) 

       CCE is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. CCE is the world’s 
largest bottler of Coca-Cola products and a major Kmart vendor.  CCE’s common stock is 
registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and is listed on the 
New York Stock Exchange. 

B.     RESPONDENT 

       Kirkpatrick was National Sales Director for CCE in charge of the Kmart account at all 
relevant times through January 2004, when he was asked to resign.  Kirkpatrick worked out of a 
Farmington Hills, Michigan, field office during the relevant period.    

C.     FACTS 

       1.     Kmart Improperly Recognized Vendor Allowances 

       Kmart improperly recognized millions of dollars worth of vendor “allowances” prior to 
bankruptcy.  Kmart obtained allowances from its vendors for various promotional and marketing 
activities.  A significant number of allowances were recognized prematurely – or “pulled 
forward” -- on the basis of false information provided to Kmart’s accounting department, while 
the true terms of the payments were set forth in undisclosed side agreements.  As a result of these 
accounting irregularities, Kmart’s cost of goods sold was understated, and earnings were 
materially overstated, for the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended January 31, 2001 (“fiscal year 
2000”). 

       2.     Kmart’s Vendor Allowance Tracking System (“VATS”) Forms 

       The principal document involved in the pulling forward of vendor allowances was Kmart’s 
VATS form.  VATS forms summarized the basic terms of vendor allowances for the company’s 
accounting department.  Bookkeepers inputted information from the VATS form into the 
company’s computerized accounting system, where it was eventually posted to the general ledger.  
To ensure proper accounting for an allowance, the VATS form should have reflected the true 
purpose of, and effective dates for, the payment.  To pull forward an allowance, this information 
was misrepresented on the VATS form to make it look like the payment was for past performance, 
                                              2

---------------------Page 3---------------------

when in truth it related to future obligations.  Kmart had a number of safeguards designed to ensure 
the accuracy of the VATS forms and proper recognition of vendor allowances.  These included the 
requirement that vendors co-sign VATS forms.   

       3.     Kirkpatrick Signed Two Misstated VATS Forms 

       At a meeting on or about January 5, 2001, Kirkpatrick learned that Kmart’s food and 
consumables division needed $5 million from CCE to help cover a divisional profit shortfall.  As 
explained in a subsequent e-mail to Kirkpatrick on January 11, 2001, “dave, i appreciate your 
efforts however i need to accelerate your schedule.  with the close of our fiscal on 1/31 i need to 
line up another partner.  the bottom line is we need the 5.0m stay in touch.”  Kirkpatrick responded 
by e-mail, “[] How about 7:30AM on Tuesday 1/16/0[1]? I’ll bring the donuts and the checkbook.”  
Kirkpatrick attended additional meetings at Kmart in mid to late January 2001, after which CCE 
agreed to “advance” $3 million worth of allowances in exchange for sales and promotional 
activities by Kmart during calendar year 2001 and to pay $2 million to settle accounts for calendar 
year 2000. To memorialize that agreement, Kmart and CCE entered into a written contract dated 
January 30, 2001 (“Coke Contract”), which was negotiated by Kirkpatrick on behalf of CCE.  The 
Coke Contract provided in relevant part that CCE would pay $3 million to support mutually 
agreed-upon marketing activities during calendar year 2001.  Kmart would earn this allowance if, 
and only if, it sold targeted amounts of CCE product during the calendar year.   

       At the end of January 2001, Kirkpatrick signed several VATS forms, including two relating 
to the $3 million “advance.”  The first, VATS No. 226003, purported to relate to a $2.25 million 
“Case display allowance” with an effective date of 02/01/00 to 12/31/00; the second, VATS No. 
226004, purported to relate to a $750,000 “Holiday Display activation” allowance with an effective 
date of 11/01/00 to 12/31/00.  VATS Nos. 226003 and 226004 misrepresented the effective dates 
and purpose of these allowances.  The true terms of the allowances were set forth in the Coke 
Contract and a subsequent letter Kirkpatrick wrote, neither of which was provided to Kmart’s 
accounting department or independent auditor.  As explained therein, CCE agreed to pay $3 
million to support mutually agreed-upon marketing activities during calendar year 2001.   

       On or about January 30, 2001, Kmart’s accounting department entered the false VATS 
information into the company’s computerized accounting system, where it was eventually posted 
to the general ledger. VATS Nos. 226003 and 226004 caused the cost of goods sold to be 
understated by approximately $3 million in fiscal year 2000.  CCE paid the $3 million allowance 
by check dated April 4, 2001, but the money was subject to repayment if Kmart did not perform in 
accordance with the terms of the Coke Contract.   

       4.     CCE’s False Third-Party Confirmation 

       Kmart’s independent auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”), sought to confirm 
with CCE the terms of the $2.25 million allowance during the fiscal year 2000 audit.  Towards that 
end, PwC faxed Kirkpatrick a third-party confirm relating to VATS No. 226003 on or about 
February 19, 2001.  The third-party confirm, which was on Kmart letterhead, read in relevant part, 
“Our auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers L.P.P. are performing an annual audit of our financial 
                                               3

statements.  They have requested of us to confirm directly with you the following vendor 
allowance agreement [Vats No. 226003].”  On or about March 5, 2001, Kirkpatrick filled out by 
hand, signed, and faxed to PwC an executed third-party confirm that, as he knew or was reckless in 
not knowing, misrepresented the nature of (“Case display allowance”) and effective dates 
(“02/01/00 to 12/31/00”) for the $2.25 million allowance.   

       5.     Kmart’s Earnings Were Overstated 

       On March 13, 2001 Kmart filed its Form 10-K for the period ended January 31, 2001.  
According to the financial statements incorporated into the Form 10-K, Kmart reported net income 
for the fourth quarter of $249 million or $0.48 per share, exceeding Wall Street analyst 
expectations of $0.47 by a penny.  Kirkpatrick’s accounting irregularities caused Kmart’s net 
income for the quarter to be overstated by approximately 1.2 percent. 

D.     CONCLUSION 

       As a result of the foregoing, Kirkpatrick committed violations of Rule 13b2-1 of the 
Exchange Act and caused violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 
and 13b2-2 promulgated thereunder.   

                                              IV. 

       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in Kirkpatrick’s Offer.2 

       Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Respondent Kirkpatrick cease and desist 
from committing or causing any violations and any future violations Rule 13b2-1 of the Exchange 
Act and causing any violations and any future violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and 
Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13b2-2 promulgated thereunder.   

 By       the Commission.
