 B.     FACTS 
         
                                           Summary 
                                                     
        6.     The Division of Enforcement has ongoing fraud investigations concerning Clients 
 A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I, each of which is a U.S. issuer whose securities were registered with 
 the Commission and whose principal operations were based in the Peoples Republic of China. 
                        
        7.     This action stems from Respondents  willful refusal, in response to  
 Commission requests, to provide the Commission with audit workpapers and other materials 
 prepared in connection with audit work or interim reviews performed for Clients A, B, C, D, E, F, 
 G, H, and I, in contravention of their legal obligations as foreign public accounting firms. 
  
                              Commissions Section 106 Requests  
         
        8.     On February 1, 2012 , pursuant to Section 106 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
(Sarbanes-Oxley), as amended by Section 929J of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and 
Consumer Protection Act (Section 106), the Commission served BDO China    , through its 
designated U.S. agent for service of Section 106 requests, with a request for [a]ll audit work papers 
and all other documents related to any audit work or interim reviews performed for [Client A] for 
the fiscal years ended December 31, 2010. 
 
        9.     On April 26, 2012, pursuant to Section 106, the Commission served E&Y Beijing, 
through its designated U.S. agent for service of Section 106 requests, with a request for [a]ll audit 
work papers  and all other documents related to any audit work or interim reviews performed for 
[Client B] for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010. 
         
        10.    On February 2, 2012, pursuant to Section 106, the Commission served E&Y 
Beijing, through its designated U.S. agent for service of Section 106 requests, with a request for 
[a]ll audit work papers  and all other documents related to any audit work or interim reviews 
performed for [Client C] for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2010 and 2011. 
         
        11.    On February 6, 2012, pursuant to Section 106, the Commission served KPMG 
Beijing, through its designated U.S. agent for service of Section 106 requests, with a request for 
[a]ll audit work papers  and all other documents related to any audit work or interim reviews 
performed for [Client D] for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010. 
         
        12.    On February 9, 2012, pursuant to Section 106, the Commission served KPMG 
Beijing, through its designated U.S. agent for service of Section 106 requests, with a request for 
[a]ll audit work papers  and all other documents related to any audit work or interim reviews 
performed for [Client E] for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010. 
         
        13.    On February 3, 2012 pursuant to Section 106, the Commission served KPMG 
Beijing, through its designated U.S. agent for service of Section 106 requests, with a request for 
[a]ll audit work papers  and all other documents related to any audit reports issued, audit work 

                                                3

performed, or interim reviews conducted for [Client F] for the fiscal years ended December 31, 
2008, 2009, and 2010. 
         
        14.    On February 14, 2012, pursuant to Section 106, the Commission served DTTC   , 
through its designated U.S. agent for service of Section 106 requests, with a request for [a]ll audit 
work papers  and all other documents related to any audit work or interim reviews performed for 
[Client G] for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. 
  
        15.    On February 8, 2012 pursuant to Section 106, the Commission served PwC 
Shanghai, through its designated U.S. agent for service of Section 106 requests, with a request for

        16.    On February 16 , 2012, pursuant to Section 106, the Commission served PwC

[a]ll audit work papers  and all other documents related to any audit work performed for [Client I] 
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010. 
         
        17.    Each of the Respondent s has  informed the Commission that it will not produce the 
documents to the Commission as requested in the Section 106 requests because, among other 
things, Respondents interpret the law of the Peoples Republic of China as prohibiting Respondents 
from doing so. 
         
        18.    As of the date of this Order, the Commission does not have possession of the audit 
workpapers and ot her relevant documents sought in any of the Section 106 requests. 
  
 C.     VIOLATIONS 
  
        19.    Section 106(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley directs a foreign public accounting firm that  
 issues an audit report, performs audit work, or conducts interim reviews to produce the audit 
 workpapers of the foreign public accounting firm and all other documents of the firm related to any 
 such audit work or interim review to the Commission upon request. 
         
        20.    A willful refusal to comply, in whole or in part, with a request by the Commission  
 under Section 106 is a violation of Sarbanes-Oxley.  See Section 106(e). 
  
        21.    A violation of Sarbanes-Oxley constitutes a violation of the Securities Exchange  
 Act of 1934 (Exchange Act).  See Sarbanes-Oxley Section 3(b)(1). 
  
        22.    BDO China has willfully refused to provide the Commission with its audit 
 workpapers and all other documents relating to BDO Chinas audit  or interim review work for 
 Client A. 
  
        23.    E&Y Beijing has willfully refused to provide the Commission with its audit 
 workpapers and all other documents relating to E&Y Beijings audit or interim review work for 
 Client B. 

                                                4 
  
---------------------Page 5---------------------

 
       24.    E&Y Beijing has willfully refused to provide the Commission with its audit 
workpapers and all other documents relating to E&Y Beijings audit or interim review work for 
Client C. 
 
       25.    KPMG Beijing has willfully refused to provide the Commission with its audit 
workpapers and all other documents relating to KPMG Beijings audit or interim review work for 
Client D. 
 
       26.    KPMG Beijing has willfully refused to provide the Commission with its audit 
workpapers and all other documents relating to KPMG Beijings audit or interim review work for

workpapers and all other documents relating to PwC Shanghai s audit or interim review work for 
Client H. 
        
       30.    PwC Shanghai has willfully refused to provide the Commission with its audit 
workpapers and all other documents relating to PwC Shanghai s audit or interim review work for 
Client I. 
        
       31.    As such, Respondents have each willfully violated Section 106 of Sarbanes-Oxley 
and therefore also the Exchange Act. 
        
       32.    As a result of the conduct described above, it is appropriate that this proceeding be 
brought pursuant to Rule 102(e) (1)(iii) of the Commission  s Rules of Practice to determine 
whether Respondents should be censured or denied the privilege of appearing and practicing before 
the Commission for having willfully violated Section 106 of Sarbanes-Oxley. 
 
                                                 
                                              III. 
        
       In view of the allegations made by the Division of Enforcement, the Commission deems it 
appropriate and  in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be instituted to

       A.     Whether the allegations set forth above are true and, in connection therewith, to 
              afford Respondents an opportunity to establish any defenses to such allegations;  
            

                                               5

       B.     What, if any, remedial action is appropriate against Respondents pursuant to Rule 
              102(e)(1)(iii) of Commissions Rules of Practice.  
               
                                              IV. 
        
       IT IS ORDERED that a public hearing for the purpose of taking evidence on the questions 
set forth in Section III hereof shall be convened at a time and place to be fixed, and before an 
Administrative Law Judge to be designated by further order as provided by Rule 110 of the

contained in this Order within twenty (20) days after service of this Order, as provided by Rule 220 
of the Commissions Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.220.  
        
       If any Respondent fails to file the directed answer, or fails to appear at a hearing after being 
duly notified, such Respondent may be deemed in default and the proceedings may be determined 
against such Respondent upon consideration of this Order, the allegations of which may be deemed 
to be true as provided by Rules 155(a), 220(f), 221(f) and 310 of the Commissions Rules of 
Practice, 17 C.F.R.  §§ 201.155(a), 201.220(f), 201.221(f) and 201.310. 
        
       Under the authority conferred by Rule 141(a)(2) of the Commissions Rules of Practice, 
17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2), this Order shall be served upon Respondents through the respective 
domestic registered public accounting firms or other United States agents that Respondents have 
designated for service under Section 106(d) of Sarbanes-Oxley, 15 U.S.C. § 7216(d), or by any 
other method reasonably calculated to give notice to a Respondent, provided that the other method 
of service used is not prohibited by the law of the foreign country in which the Respondent is 
located. 
                                                              
       IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Administrative Law Judge shall issue an initial 
decision no later than 300 days from the date of service of this Order, pursuant to Rule 360(a)(2) of 
the Commissions Rules of Practice.  
        
       In the absence of an appropriate waiver, no officer or employee of the Commission engaged 
in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions in this or any factually related 
proceeding will be permitted to participate or advise in the decision of this matter, except as witness 
or counsel in proceedings held pursuant to notice.  Since this proceeding is not rule making within 
the meaning of Section 551 of the Administrative Procedure Act, it is not deemed subject to the 
provisions of Section 553 delaying the effective date of any final Commission action. 
        
       By the Commission.
