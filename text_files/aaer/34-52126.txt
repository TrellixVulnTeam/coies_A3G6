                                              III.  
 
       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds 1
                                                                                 as follows: 
 
RESPONDENT  
 
       Cheshire, age 56, was the president and chief operating officer of Gerber Scientific, Inc.  
from February 1997 to September 1998 and chief executive officer and Chairman of the Board of 
Directors from September 1998 until November 2001.  Mr. Cheshire resides in Farmington, 
Connecticut. 
 
RELEVANT ENTITY  
 
       Gerber Scientific, Inc. (“Gerber” or “Company”),                       a Connecticut corporation with its 
headquarters in South Windsor, Connecticut, at all  relevant times, was a provider of sign making 
and specialty graphics, apparel and flexible materials, and ophthalmic lens processing goods and 
services.  During those times, Gerber conducted its business primarily through four subsidiaries:  
Gerber Scientific Products, Inc. (“GSP”); Spandex PLC; Gerber Technology, Inc.; and Gerber 
Coburn Optical, Inc. (“Gerber Coburn”).  Gerber uses a fiscal year that ends on April 30.  Its  
common stock is registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act 
and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 
SUMMARY  
        
           While Gerber was preparing its annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2000, 
Cheshire learned that, due to a clerical error, the Company had failed to record approximately 
$1.5 million of a $6.2 million decrease in the value of the inventory of the Company’s GSP 
subsidiary for the fourth quarter.  Notwithstanding this information, the Company did not 
disclose this mistake by correcting its previously issued press release reporting earnings for the 
quarter and year ended April 30, 2000, and then filed its annual report on Form 10-K with 
materially inaccurate financial statements and related disclosures.   Had Gerber correctly  
recorded the entire $6.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2000, its reported net earnings would 
have been $725,000 or $0.04 per share for the quarter and $24.9 million or $1.12 per share for 
the year.  Instead, Gerber erroneously reported net earnings of $1.7 million, or $0.08 per share, 
for the quarter, and net earnings of $25.875 million, or $1.16 per share, for the year.   Cheshire  
knew or should have known of the inaccuracies but nonetheless signed the Form 10-K.  Due to 
his actions, Cheshire was a cause of Gerber’s violation of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and 
Exchange Act Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 resulting from the materially inaccurate financial

 The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent's Offer and   are not binding on any 
other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

statements and disclosures that the Company included in its Form 10-K for fiscal year 2000 as a 
result of the failure to record the $1.5 million.    
        
FACTS  
 
       By late February 2000, Cheshire had been informed of a large discrepancy between the 
estimated value of GSP’s physical inventory and the value of that inventory reflected on the 
Company’s books.  As a result, Cheshire ordered an expanded annual review of GSP’s 
inventory.  The review was begun by GSP personnel and then completed by a special internal 
audit team formed to determine the precise amount of the discrepancy.  By no later than April 
25, 2000, the special audit team informed Cheshire that GSP’s inventory was overstated by 
approximately $6 million. 
 
       On April 26, 2000, Gerber issued a press release disclosing that it would record a charge 
of approximately $6 million to write down the value of GSP’s inventory.  The Company reported 
that it expected that the charge would equal $.17 per share and that, before any restructuring 
charges, it expected earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2000 to be reduced to $.08 to 
$.12 per share and earnings for the year to be $1.16 to $1.20 per share. 
 
       By early May 2000, the special audit team informed Cheshire that the exact amount of 
the overstatement of GSP’s inventory was $6.2 million.  On May 25, 2000, Gerber issued a press 
release announcing its results for the fourth quarter and year ended April 30, 2000.  Gerber 
reported net earnings of $1.7 million, or $.08 per share, for the quarter and net earnings of $25.9 
million, or $1.16 per share, for the year.  Gerber announced that the write-down equaled $.18 per 
share, gave the write-down as one of two principal reasons why its earnings for the quarter were 
lower than the prior year’s fourth quarter earnings, and stated that, without the write-down, per 
share earnings for the year would have been $1.34 and thus would have exceeded the prior year’s 
earnings of $1.29 per share. 
 
       During GSP’s budgeting process in June 2000, GSP management discovered that the 
Company actually had recorded only $4.7 million of the $6.2 million charge for the inventory  
overstatement.  In late June 2000, Cheshire was informed of the $1.5 million error.  In early July 
2000, Cheshire discussed how to handle the error with Gerber’s chief financial officer and 
controller. 
        
       Notwithstanding the discovery of the failure to record $1.5 million of the $6.2 million 
charge, the Company, on July 27, 2000, filed its annual report on Form 10-K for 2000 that 
reported the same results that the Company had announced in its May 25, 2000, press release.  2 
                                                                                                 
In addition, in footnotes to the financial statements and other disclosures in the Form 10-K, the 
Company misrepresented that it had recorded the entire $6.2 million charge.  Had Gerber 
recorded the entire $6.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2000, reported net earnings 
would have been $725,000, or $.04 per share, for the quarter and $24.9 million, or $1.12 per

 The Company also did not correct the May 25, 2000, press release.

share, for the year.  Even though he was aware of the $1.5 million error, Cheshire signed the 
Form 10-K with the inaccurate financial statements and disclosures that resulted from the failure  
to record the entire $6.2 million charge.3 
                                         
 
DISCUSSION   
 
       Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act requires issuers of registered securities to file periodic 
reports with the Commission containing information prescribed by specific Commission rules.  
Rule 13a-1 requires the filing of annual reports on Form 10-K.  Rule 12b-20 requires, in addition 
to information required by Commission rules to be included in periodic reports, such further 
material information as may be necessary to make the required statements not misleading.  These 
reports are required to be complete and accurate.  See SEC v. Savoy Industries, Inc., 587 F.2d 
1149, 1165 (D.C. Cir. 1978). 
        
       As a result of its failure to record the $1.5 million error in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 
2000, Gerber violated Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20 and  
13a-1.4
         In its annual report on Form 10-K for 2000, the Company misstated its earnings for both 
the fourth quarter and the year.  In addition, the Company misrepresented that it had recorded the 
entire $6.2 million charge when, in fact, it had recorded only $4.7 million. 
        
       Cheshire knew or should have known that, as a result of the failure to record the $1.5 
million, reported earnings and other disclosures in the Form 10-K were inaccurate.  By then 
signing the Form 10-K, Cheshire was a cause of Gerber’s violation of Section 13(a) of the 
Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1. 
 
                                               IV. 
 
       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
specified in Respondent Michael J. Cheshire’s Offer.

 On August 27, 2002, Gerber filed its annual report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended April 
30, 2002.  In that Form 10-K, Gerber included restated financial statements for its fiscal years 
ended April 30, 2000, and April 30, 2001, and for the seven quarters ended January 31, 2002.  It 
also restated its retained earnings as of April 30, 1999.  Among other things, the Company 
included a restatement for its failure to record the $1.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 
2000.

 The Commission previously issued an Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, Making 
Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 finding that Gerber violated, among other provisions, Section 13(a) of the 
Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1.  See Gerber Scientific, Inc., Exchange 
Act Release No. 49541 (Apr. 8, 2004).  Gerber consented to the issuance of the order without 
admitting or denying the findings other than those as to jurisdiction.  Id.

            ACCORDINGLY, IT  IS ORDERED THAT, pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange 
Act, Michael J. Cheshire cease and desist from causing any violations and any future violations of 
Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1.
