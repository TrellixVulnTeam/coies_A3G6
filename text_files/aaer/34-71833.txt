        The Division of Enforcement appeals from the decision of an administrative law judge in 
a proceeding brought pursuant to Sections 4C and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
                                                                               1
and Rule 102(e)(1)(i) and (iii) of the Commission's Rules of Practice.             The law judge found   , 
among other things,    that S.W. Hatfield, CPA ("the Firm"), a Texas accounting firm, and Scott W. 
Hatfield, the Firm's sole proprietor (together, "Respondents"), did not violate         Exchange Act 
Section 10(b)   with respect to  certain audit reports that Respondents      allegedly  issued   while the 
                                    2
Firm's state license was expired.       This order requests   that the   parties   address (1)  the legal 
theories and fact s  regarding the "in connection with" requirement under Exchange Act Section 
10(b)  ; (2)  the implication on the Division's request for s  anctions under    Exchange Act Section      4C 
and  Rule   102(e)   of  the  disciplinary sanctions imposed on Respondents      in a separate disciplinary 
proceeding   after the conclusion of briefing in this matter before the law judge       ;  and  (3)  the 
applicability of Rule of Pra   ctice 102(e) (1) (i) to Respondents where the Firm's state license had 
been renewed and was current as of the date of the institution of this proceeding.           

I.      The "in connection with" requirement under Exchange Act Section 10(b) 

        A September 6, 2012 Corrected Order Instituting Proceedings ("OIP") alleges that 
Respondents "issued thirty-eight audit reports that twenty-one issuers included in periodic 
reports and registration statements filed with the Commission."           An appendix attached to the OIP

        15 U.S.C. §§ 78d    -3, 78u  -3; 17 C.F.R. § 201.  102(e)(1)(i) and (iii).

      identifies, among other things, the dates of each of the thirty-eight reports, and the date on which 
 1 
      each report was included as part of a filing with the Commission. 

 2 
              The OIP further alleges that Respondents issued those audit reports between 
 3   January 31, 2010 and May 19, 2011, a period during which the Firm's state license was expired 
      ("Expired License Period").  The OIP alleges that the following activity occurred during the 
 4 
      Expired License Period with respect to the securities of some of the twenty-one issuers: 

 5 
         Five of the issuers (888 Acquisition Corp., Eight Dragons Co., HPC Acquisitions, Inc., 
 6        Truewest Corp., and     X-Change Corp.) were quoted on the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board 
          ("OTCBB"), and trading occurred during the Expired License Period for a specified number 
 7                                                                                                              3
          of days in each issuer's securities; the dates on which the trades occurred are not identified.            

 8 
         SMSA Kerrville Acquisition Corp. issued restricted, unregistered common stock on 
                                 4
 9        December 15, 2010.          

10      Asia Green Agriculture Corp., f/k/a SMSA Palestine Acquisition Corp. ("SMSA Palestine"), 
          issued shares for 100% of the outstanding common stock of Sino Oriental Agriculture Group 
11 
          Limited "in August 2010," and filed a Form S-1 on September 20, 2010 and subsequent 
                                                                      5
12        amendments before going effective on July 15, 2011.              

13      Three of the issuers (Signet International Holdings, Inc., SMSA Crane Acquisition Corp., 
          and SMSA Gainesville Acquisition Corp.) "disclosed issuances" of unregistered, restricted 
14                                                                                                     6
          common stock for acquisitions and for services during the Expired License Period.                 

15 
         X-Change Corp. issued securities to convert or retire outstanding debt and to obtain certain 
16                                                                              7
          intellectual property rights during the Expired License Period.            

17 
              In  the factual discussion of  its motion for summary dispo     sition,   the Division reiterates the 
      activity of the five issuer s who were quoted on the OTCBB;         SMSA Kerrville Acquisition Corp.        ; 
18 
      the three issuers who "disclosed issuances" of unregi      stered, restricted common stock;      and X  -
19    Change Corp.   's issuance of securiti es.    But the Division does not refer to SMSA Palestine.  In      the 
      argument section of its motion, t   he Division   states   that "Respondents' actions were made in 
20 
      connection with the purchase and sale of securities of the 21 issuers for        whom they issued audit 
      reports."  But, in support of this argument, the Division references only the five issuers whose 
21 
      securities traded on the OTCBB and       a sixth issuer, SMSA Kerrville Acquisition Corp.  The 
                                                                                                      8
22    Division provides no analysis or citation to a    ny authority other than    SEC v. Zandford,     for the

      proposition that the "in connection with" requirement under Exchange Act Section 10(b) should 
 1                                                                        9
      be read broadly, and Ames Dep't Stores Inc. Stock Litig.,             for the proposition that the "in 

 2    connection with" req     uirement is satisfied if the misrepresentation occurs in periodic reports filed 
      with the Commission.        
 3 
               The Division's reply brief in support of its motion for summary disposition alleges that a 
 4 
      "[m]ore  -[t]han [s]uffic  ient " number of misstatements were made in connection with the purchase 
      and sale of securities, citing in support the same six issuers          as discussed in the argument section 
 5 
      of its motion for summary disposition,         and arguing that the "in connection with" require          ment 
 6    was met because "Res       pondents' fraud 'somehow touche         [d] upon' and had 'some nexus' with '        any 
      securities transaction.'  SEC v. Clark, 915 F.2d 439, 449 (9th Cir. 1990) (emphasis added)."  But 
 7 
      the reply brief also argues that the fees earned for all thirty-eight reports issued for the twenty-

 8   one issuers are "directly traceable to Respondents' fraud" and should be disgorged.  The 
      Division's brief on appeal provides no further clarification of its theory of the "in connection 
 9   with" element of its fraud charge. 

10             After the Division filed its brief on appeal, the Supreme Court issued its decision in 
                                                  10
      Chadbourne & Park, LLP v. Troice,              which addresses the scope of the "in connection with" 
11 
      element of Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b               -5 thereunder in the    context of an implie     d 
12    private right of action   .   For purposes of determining whether the Securities Litigation Uniform 
      Standards Act of 1988 ("SLUSA") forbade the bringing of a state securities class action, the 
13    Court d  etermined that, under SLUSA,          "[a] frau dulent misrepresentation or omission is not made 
      'in connection with' such a 'purchase or sale of a covered security' unless it is material to a 
14 
      decision by one or more individuals (other than the fraudster) to buy or to sell a 'covered 
                  11
15    security.'"      The C  ourt clarified that its holding "does     not limit the Federal Government's 
                                                                 12
      authority to prosecute 'frauds like the one here.'"             Rather, the Court   pointed out   that,  " despite 
16 
      the Governme     nt's and the dissent'   s hand   wringing, neither has been able to point to        an example 
      of any prior SEC enforcement action brought during the past               80 years that our holding today 
17                                                             13
      would have prevented the SEC from bringing.             "     The  parties have not had the opportunity to 
18

               991 F.2d 953, 962 (2d Cir. 1993).

               134 S.   Ct. 1058   (Feb. 26, 2014).    
20    11
               Id. at 1066.  SLUSA forbids the bringing of large securities class actions "based upon the 

21   statutory or common law of any State" in which the plaintiffs allege "a misrepresentation or 
      omission of a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security."  
22   15 U.S.C. § 78bb(f)(1).  A covered security is one that trades on a national exchange.  Id. at 
      § 78bb(f)(1)(5)(E).  In the underlying case, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants helped Allen 
23 
      Stanford and his companies implement a Ponzi scheme by misrepresenting that the uncovered 
24   securities (certificates of deposit in Stanford International Bank) plaintiffs purchased were 
      backed by highly-marketable and stable covered securities.  The district court dismissed the case, 
25   concluding that the alleged misrepresentations provided the requisite "connection" to 
      transactions in covered securities.

     address any implications of that case on the analysis of the "in connection with" issue in this 
 1 
     matter.   
 2 
         For the foregoing reasons, we direct the Division to submit supplemental briefing to: 
 3 
       Identify specifically the issuers for which the Division argues that Respondents made 
 4       misstatements "in connection with" the purchase or sale of the issuer's securities. 

 5 
       For each issuer identified in response to the above, identify specifically:  the purchases or 
 6       sales of securities in connection with which alleged misstatements were made; Respondents' 
         reports in which those alleged misstatements were made and the filing or filings with the 
 7       Commission in which those alleged misstatements appeared; and when the purchases or sales 
         of securities occurred in relation to when each of the filings were made.   
 8 

 9     For each issuer identified in response to the above, explain in what way Respondents' alleged 
         misstatements touch upon and have some nexus with any securities transaction. 
10 
       If, in responding to the above, the Division identifies alleged misstatements in fewer than all 
11 
         thirty-eight reports for the twenty-one issuers listed in the appendix to the OIP, explain the 
12       basis for the assertion that fees earned for all thirty-eight reports issued for the twenty-one 
         issuers, are "directly traceable to Respondents' fraud" for purposes of assessing 
13       disgorgement. 

14 
       Address the significance, if any, of the decision in Chadbourne & Park, LLP v. Troice on any 

15       of the Division's arguments in this case. 

16   II.    Exchange Act Section 4C and Commission Rule 102(e) 
      
17 
     A.     Sanctions under Exchange Act Section 4C and Commission Rule 102(e) 
      
18 
            The OIP instituted public administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings to determine 
19   whether, among other things, Respondents should be censured or denied, temporarily or 
     permanently, the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission as accountants 
20 
     pursuant to Exchange Act Section 4C and Rule 102(e).  In the Division's brief in support of its 
     motion for summary disposition, and in a similar statement in its reply brief, the Division states 
21 
     that "Respondents are currently licensed as CPAs who continue to provide attest services to 
22   public—and possibly non-public—companies.  They therefore pose a continuing threat to the 
     Commission's processes and to the investing public." (citations omitted)  Thus, the Division 
23 
     argues, "Respondents should be permanently barred from appearing before the Commission in 
     accordance with Rule 102(e)(1)(i) and (iii)."  
24 
      
25          The parties completed their briefing before the law judge in March 2013.   On July 3, 
     2013, the Commission issued an adjudicatory opinion regarding an appeal filed by Respondents 
26 
     that challenged disciplinary action taken by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board

      ("PCAOB") against Respondents for conduct not at issue in this proceeding.                              The Commission        
 1 
      found that Respondents          violated   certain   PCAOB rules by repeatedly failing to adhere to the 

 2    PCAOB      's interim auditing standards during the audits of two unrelated pub                   lic companies     .  The 

      Commission        sustained the PCAOB's decision to             permanently      revoke the firm     's r egistration and 
 3                                                                                                                 15
      permanently      bar Hatfield     from association with a registered public accounting firm                 .     The 

      Commission        concluded that the PCAOB's sanctions were necessary                    " to protect the integrity of 
 4 
      the Commission's processes and encourage more rigorous                      comp  liance with auditing standards           
                                                                                   16
 5    both by [Respondents] and by other independent auditors                    ."     Respondents did not appeal the 

      Commission's       decision   .    
 6               

                We have stated that "[t]he Commission disciplines professionals pursuant to Rule 102(e) 
 7                                                                    17
      in order to 'pr   otect the integrity of its processes.'"            The re is a similarity between the purpose 

 8    and  scope   of the PCAOB         sanctions discussed above and the            bar  sought by the Division        under 

      Exchange Act Section 4C and             Rul e 102(e)   .   T he  parties did not have     the opportun    ity to address 
 9    before the law judge, and have not addressed before the Commission,                        any implications       that  the 

      July 3, 2013 Commission           decision may have        on the analysis of sanctions under Exchange Act 
10 
      Section 4C and Rule 102(e)           in this matter.      We  direct the   Division to submit supplemental 

11    briefing to explain t     he extent to which the       re is overlap   , if any, between the      PCAOB sanctions         

      and  sanction    s  under Exchange Act Section 4C and Rule 102(e)                 ,  and whether    such additional

      B.        Applicability of Exchange Act Section 4C(a)(1) and Rule 102(e)(1)(i) 

14    

                Exchange Act Section 4C(a)(1) and Rule 102(e)(1)(i) provide that the Commission may 
15   impose sanctions on any person who is found "not to possess the requisite qualifications to 
                             18
      represent others."          The OIP alleges that      " Respondents      do  not posse   ss the requisite 
16 
      qualifications     to represent others     , pursuant to Section 4C(a)(1) and Rule 102(e)(1)(i)                of the 
                                                  19
17    Commission's Rules of Practice           ."     Sim ilarly, the Division states in its       Motion for Summary 

      Disposition     that "Respondents do not possess the requisite qualifications to represent others                      ," 
18    and, in its brief on appeal, that "Respondents lack the requ                isite qualifications to represent others."           

      In support of these allegations, the Division points to the lapse in the Firm's state license

             Moreover, the precedent cited by the Division in its brief on appeal regarding matters 
 3   brought under Exchange Act Section 4C(a)(1) and Rule 102(e)(1)(i) involved parties who were 
     not licensed at the time the Commission issued orders instituting proceedings and imposing 
 4                                               20
     remedial sanctions, i.e., settlement orders.     Supplemental briefing should address   the relevance , 
     for purposes of Exchange Act Section 4C(a)(1) and Rule 102(e)(1)(i),      of  the fact that a 
 5 
     respondent's state  license is current when an order instituting proceedings issues.

             Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the Division file a supplemental brief addressing all of 
 7   the above, together with all appropriate citations to relevant facts and authority within fourteen 
     calendar days from the date of service of this order and not exceeding 7,000 words.  Respondents

     may file a reply brief responding to the Division's supplemental brief within fourteen days from
