                                                                                that: 

A.     RESPONDENT 

       Bruce Redlin, CPA, 55, of New Berlin, Wisconsin is a certified public accountant licensed 
in the state of Wisconsin since 1975 and doing business as a sole proprietorship.  Redlin audited 
Commerce Group Corp.’s (“Commerce Group”) financial statements for the company’s 2003 
fiscal year ended March 31, 2004. 

B.     FACTS 

       1.     Commerce Group is a Wisconsin corporation with its headquarters in Milwaukee, 
Wisconsin.  Commerce Group’s common stock is registered with the Commission pursuant to 
Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and trades on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol 
CGCO.  For its fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, Commerce Group reported no revenues and 
total assets of $35.4 million.   

       2.     Commerce Group has at all relevant times been an issuer as defined by the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Act”). 

       3.     Redlin audited Commerce Group’s 2003 financial statements included in 
Commerce Group’s annual report for fiscal year 2003 on Form 10-K, filed with the Commission 
on May 27, 2004.  As part of that audit, Redlin prepared and issued an audit report dated May 10, 
2004 (the “Commerce Group audit report”), which the company included in its 2003 Form 10-K.  
Commerce Group paid Redlin $6,500 for the audit work.  4 

3 
       The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent’s Offer of Settlement and are not binding on any 
other person or entity in this or any other proceeding. 
4 
       During the course of the Commission’s investigation, Redlin voluntarily reimbursed Commerce Group the 
$6,500 in audit fees.  In view of Redlin’s reimbursement, the Commission is not ordering disgorgement in this 
matter. 

                                               2

---------------------Page 3---------------------

       4.      At the time Redlin prepared and issued the Commerce Group audit report, he was 
not registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the “Board”), as required by 
Section 102(a) of the Act. 

C.     VIOLATIONS 

       1.      Section 102(a) of the Act provides that “it shall be unlawful for any person that is 
not a registered public accounting firm to prepare or issue, or to participate in the preparation or 
issuance of, any audit report with respect to any issuer.”5 

       2.      The provisions of Section 102(a) of the Act became effective on October 22, 2003.      6 

       3.      Based on the conduct described above, Respondent willfully     7
                                                                                violated Section 
102(a) of the Act. 

D. FINDI       NGS 

       Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that Redlin willfully violated Section 102(a) 
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 

E.     UNDERTAKING 

       Respondent has undertaken not to request, demand, or accept, directly or indirectly, any 
compensation from Commerce Group in connection with the audit work associated with the 
Commerce Group audit report. In determining whether to accept the Offer, the Commission has 
considered this undertaking. 

                                                 IV. 

       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in Respondent’s Offer. 

       Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that: 

5 
       A violation of the Act or any rule that the Board issues under the Act is treated for all purposes in the same 
manner as a violation of the Exchange Act, including with respect to penalties.  Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 15 
U.S.C.A. § 7202(b)(1) (West 2002). 
6 
       Section 102(a) became effective “[b]eginning 180 days after the date of the determination of the 
Commission under Section 101(d)” of the Act that the Board was prepared to undertake its statutory responsibilities.  
The Commission made the required determination on April 25, 2003.  See Order Regarding Section 101(d) of the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Securities Act Release No. 8223, Exchange Act Release No. 47746, 2003 WL 
1956164  (Apr. 25, 2003). 
7 
       “Willfully” as used in this Order means intentionally committing the act that constitutes the violation. 
There is no requirement that the actor also be aware that he is violating a rule or statute.  See Wonsover v. SEC, 205 
F.3d 408, 414 (D.C. Cir. 2000); Tager v. SEC, 344 F.2d 5, 8 (2d Cir. 1965).

       A.      Redlin shall cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any 
future violations of Section 102(a) of the Act. 

       B.      Redlin is censured. 

       C.      Redlin may practice before the Commission as an independent accountant provided 
that: 

               1.     The public accounting firm with which he is associated is registered with 
the Board in accordance with the Act, and such registration continues to be effective; and 

               2.     He has submitted to the Commission staff (attention: Office of the Chief 
Accountant) the Board’s letter notifying the public accounting firm with which he is associated 
that its registration application has been approved. 

 By        the Commission.
