       James M. Schneider  is a certified public accountant and the former chief financial officer 
of Dell, Inc. On July 22, 2010, we filed a civil injunctive action against Dell, Schneider, and 
other Dell executives for  fraud and various reporting and recordkeeping violations.1
                                                                                     Schneider 
subsequently agreed to be permanently enjoined by   a U.S. district court from future violations of, 
among other things, the  antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws . He also  agreed to the 
Commission's filing a follow -on administrative proceeding against him, pursuant to which 
Schneider consented to our suspending   him  from appearing or practicing before the Commission 
as an accountant, with the right to apply for reinstatement after five years. Schneider now asks 
the Commission to clarify  that suspension order "to prevent the existing order from being 
construed by the Staff of the Commission as barring activities that are outside the scope of [our 
Rule of Practice Rule 102(e)(3)(i)]."2
                                      In particular, Schneider asks us to clarify that our Rule

been "permanently enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction, by reason of his or her misconduct in an action

102(e) order "does not preclude Mr. Schneider from serving on the audit committee of a 
Commission registrant or as the CFO of a public company, so long as he does not serve as the 
principal accounting officer."3
                               For the reasons below, we deny Schneider's motion.    
                                                I. 

A.     Schneider consented to a suspension from appearing or practicing before the 
       Commission as an accountant after the Commission instituted civil proceedi         ngs 
       against him.  
       On July 22, 2010, we instituted civil proceedings against Dell and certain  of its  
executives, including Schneider, in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. 
Among other violations, the complaint alleged that Dell,  Schneider, and other Dell executives 
engaged in fraud by failing to disclose material in formation and using an accounting scheme to 
create the false appearance that the company was consistently meeting Wall Street earnings 
targets and reducing its operating expenses. According to the  complaint , Dell had failed to 
disclose large "exclusivity payments" that  Intel Corporation made to Dell not to use processors 
made by  Intel's rival, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ("AMD")   . The complaint alleged  that , 
without these payments, Dell would have missed analysts'    consensus earnings -per-share 
estimates for every quarter from fiscal years 2002 through 2006. Although these   payments 
amounted to 76% of Dell's operating income by the first quarter of fiscal year 2007,  "Dell did not 
disclose the existence, much less the magnitude, of the Intel exclusivity payments." 4
                                                                                       
       In May 2006, Dell announced its intention to use AMD's processors in some of its 
products. Intel responded by cutting its exclusivity payments , and Dell subsequently reported a 
36% drop in its operating income. "In dollar terms," the complaint explained, "the reduction in 
Intel exclusivity payments was equivalent to 75% of the decline in Dell's operating income."  5
                                                                                                
But Schneider  falsely told analysts and investors in a quarterly earnings call that the drop in the 
company's operating results "was attributable to Dell pricing too aggressively in the face of 
slowing demand and to component costs declining 'less than we anticipated   .'"6
                                                                                 
       According to the complaint, Schneider also   "engaged in a wide-ranging accounting fraud 
by maintaining a series of 'cookie jar' reserves that [the company] used to cover shortfalls in 
operating results from FY02 to FY05."  7
                                         These manipulations, the complaint  explained, "were 
undertaken to meet consensus earnings targets or to misstate materially important financial

metrics." 8
           This manipulation "not only materially misstated Dell's financial results, but caused 
material misstatements in Dell's annual and quarterly reports filed with the Commission during 
the period." 9
              For example, in the second quarter of 2004, a Dell finance director told Schneider 
that Dell's Europe, Middle East, and Asia ("EMEA") unit "was having difficulty meeting its 
$159 million operating income target."    10
                                             Schneider replied, " We need $175m. You need to tell 
me how we will get it. I suggest you not be too proud and see what [a vice president of 
marketing] has socked away."     11
                                    The finance director complied with Schneider's request and 
released $16 million that had been put away. "The release of this cookie jar reserve," the 
complaint explained, "allowed the EMEA segment to report eight consecutive quarters of 
increasing operating income."    12
                                    Without the reserve, "EMEA's operating income in Q1FY05 
would have declined by about 12.5% from the prior quarter, rather than increased by 3.1%."           13
                                                                                                        

        The complaint concluded that, because of this misconduct, Schneider violated 
Sections 17(a) (2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933,    14
                                                                     Section  13(b)(5) of the  Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934,    15
                            and Exchange Act    Rules 13a-14, 13b2-1, and 13b2  -2.    16
                                                                                          It also alleged 
that Schneider aided and abetted Dell's violations of Exchange Act Sections         13(a),

denying the allegations, Schneider consented      to a permanent injunction, disgorgement     , and civil 
penalties.19
              
        On December     22, 2010, Schneider consented to our initiating administrative follow      -on 
proceedings against him    pursuant to our Rule of Practice 102(e)   (3)(i).20
                                                                               In connection with an 
order instituting and settling those proceedings, Schneider consented to being  "suspended from 
appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant"  with a right to reapply after 
five years.21
                

B.      Schneider continued to serve as a member of a          public company's audit committee  
        after the Commission imposed a bar . 
        At the time we instituted the civil injunctive proceedings, Schneider was serving as a 
director and audit committee member at three publicly       held companies. Schneider subsequently 
resigned from two of those companies, but he  continued to serve       as an  audit committee member 
at General Communications, Inc. ("GCI"), a n Alaska-based communications provider listed on 
NASDAQ. According to       GCI's proxy statement filed with the Commission on May 12, 2011, 
Schneider was  chair of GCI's audit committee and was designated as an a        udit committee 
financial expert.22
                    Schneider's name, as chair of the audit committee,      also appeared o  n GCI's 
audit committee report, which the company included in its proxy statement         .23
                                                                                     In its filing, GCI 
stated that the company's audit committee reviewed GCI' s financial statements, discussed          the 
financial statements and the accounting  principles  applied in those financial statements with

GCI's auditor, and recommended to GCI's board that the financial statements be filed with the 
Commission.   
       On August 5, 2011, Commission s    taff notified GCI and Schneider's counsel that 
Schneider was violating the terms of the Commission's    Rule 102(e) order by serving on GCI's 
audit committee. Schneider resigned  from GCI'  s audit com mittee and then filed the present 
motion seeking clarification of our Rule 102(e) order.   
                                                II. 
A.     Schneider seeks a ruling    that our Rule 102(e) order does not preclude    Schneider 
       from serv ing in certain positions, such as a CFO or audit committee member         . 
       Schneider asks us to "issue an order clarifying that the Rule 102(e) Order does not 
prohibit him from accepting non- accountant positions, such as positions on an audit committee 
or as a non-accountant CFO."  24
                                 He argues that the reason for such a clarification is "to prevent 
the existing order from being construed by the Staff of the Commission as barring activities 
outside the scope of [Rule 102(e)]."25
                                       In support, Schneider argues that the staff has already once 
exceeded its authority under our order by demand  ing that he resign from G CI's audit 
committee. 26
               
       Schneider contends that Commission staff has not cited any authority, nor is he aware of 
any, that "would have given [him] notice that ," by agreeing to the Rule 102(e)  order , he would be 
prohibit ed from " serv[ing] on an audit committee or as the CFO of a public company so long as 
he did not act as the principal accounting officer."27
                                                     Schneider concedes  that  he "theoretically 
could attempt to accept such a position and require the Staff to bring an enforcement action," but 
argues that "the Staff's past conduct with GCI demonstrates that any issuer that would appoint 
Mr. Schneider to its audit committee or as its CFO is likely to be threatened with an enforcement 
action."28
          Because of this, Schneider argues, a clarification of our order is necessary. 
       The Division opposes Schneider's motion, arguing that Schneider had fair notice that our 
Rule 102(e) order would prohibit him from serving on a public company's audit committee      or as 
a CFO. The Division contends that such a prohibition is consistent with R  ule 102(e)'s remedial 
purpose of ensuring that accountants , "on whom the Commission relies heavily in the 
performance of its statutory duties, perform their tasks diligently and with a reasonable degree of

competence."'  29
                 The Division further concludes    that  Schneider's request is not ripe for review 
"because Schneider fails to present any specific job functions for Commission review, and the 
staff stands ready to provide specific guidance when necessary     [about any future role Schneider   
may wish to take]." 30
                       
B.     Schneider's proposed clarification is inconsistent with our order and the rule on 
       which it is based. 
       Schneider seeks a ruling  from us that our Rule 102(e) order does not prohibit him from 
"accepting non-accountant positions, such as positions on an audit committee or as a non      -
accountant CFO."   31
                      We find no basis for  granting this request. As explained below, the 
applicability of our order depends on the particular tasks and responsibilities involved with any 
future position that Schneider may seek to undertake    . Schneider's proposed clarification, by 
comparison, would exempt entire job titles from our order, regardless of what tasks or      
responsibilities those positions entailed. Granting such a request would undermine the remedial 
purpose of our order and the rule on which it is based. 
       We barr  ed Schneider from appearing or practicing before us     as an accountant pursuant to 
our authority under Rule 102. That rule defines "practicing before the Commission" as including, 
but not limited to, "[t]ransacting any business with the Commission" and "[t]he preparation of 
any statement, opinion or other paper by any . . . accountant . . . filed with the Commission in 
any registration statement, notification, application, report or other document with the consent of 
such . . . accountant."32
                         Determining whether a particular position fits within th   at definition 
involves a "fact-specific inquiry" into the  conduct involved when serving in such a position.   33
                                                                                                    As 
a U.S. district court recently explained, someone who is appear    ing or practic ing before the 
Commission as an accountant includes      persons who "'participate[d] in the preparation of' 
financial statements filed with the Commission by, for example, 'creat[ing],' 'compil[ing]' or

     17 C.F.R. § 201.102(f). Because we barred Schneider pursuant to our authority under Rule 102, that rule's 
definitions apply to our order. Cf. Charles E. Gaecke, Investment Advisers Act Release No. 2681, 2007 SEC LEXIS 
2809, at *9 (Dec. 4, 2007) (stating that, because "we issued the Bar Order pursuant to our authority under the 
Advisers Act . . . the definition of 'investment adviser' in the Advisers Act applies when that term is used in the Bar 
Order").

'edit[ing]' information or data incorporated into those documents and consenting to their 
incorporation." 34
                   

        Nothing in this definition discusses, let alone exempts, specific job titles, such as CFO or 
audit committee member. This is by design. As we recognized in our release ad           opting the 1998 
amendments to Rule 102(e), the Commission's limited resources  mean that the Commission and 
the investing public must "rely heavily on accountants to assure corporate compliance with 
federal securities law and disclosure of accurate and reliable financial information."       35
                                                                                                
Accountants play "a particularly important role . . . in preparing and certifying the accuracy of 
financial statements of public companies that are so heavily relied upon by the public in making 
investment decisions."   36
                            Thi s process is impaired if incompetent or unethical accountants are 
permitted to participate in the preparation of financial statements certified and filed with the 
Commission.   37
                 We therefor e promulgated Rule 102(e) to ensure that these professionals on 
whom we rely so heavily "'perform their tasks diligently and with a reasonable degree of 
competence.'"  38
                  

        These remedial purposes would be undermined if we were to hold that Schneider could 
avoid the prohibition in our Rule 102(e) order by accepting a position based only on that 
position's title or on whether non-  accountants could accept such a position.     39
                                                                                      Incompetent or

unethical accountants pose a risk to our process regardless of what title they      holdor whether  or 
not they are even licensed accountant    s. Accountants, we have explained, "often serve as 
corporate officers, and the integrity of the Commission's processes is threatened when they 
execute fraudulent schemes by providing falsified financial information just as when licensed 
accountants engage in this conduct."    40
                                           This interpretation  of Rule 102(e)'s remedial purpose, we 
have noted, also accords with cases in which we have denied the privilege of appearing or 
practicing before the Commission to incompetent or unethical accountants serving in a var iety of 
positions, including the very ones that Schneider seeks to carve out of our order.      41
                                                                                           And a U.S. 
district court recently found that someone serving in a "general advisory role" with the title 
"Director of Mergers and Acquisitions" violated a Rule 102(e) order prohibiting him from 
appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant.        42
                                                                           The court found that, even 
though the company established procedures designed to ensure that this person "          would not be 
involved with the accounting department and accounting data,"         he violated the Rule 102(e) order 
by preparing financial data and determining how particular data should be treated in the 
company's financial statements.    43
                                      

        This breadth of ways in which accountant      s can threaten our processes highligh    ts the 
inherent difficulty of enumerating every position that Schneider could take        that would be 
prohibited by, or consistent with, our Rule 102(e) order     , but that does not , as Schneider argues, 
render our order impermissibly vague     .44

proscription "'mark out the rough area of prohibited conduct, allowing law-abiding individuals to 
conform their conduct by steering clear of the prohibition.'"       45
                                                                       In implementing such a 
proscription, "[n]o more than a     reasonable degree of certainty can be demanded and it is not 
unfair to require that one who deliberately goes perilously close to an area of proscribed conduct 
shall take the risk that he may cross the line.''  46
                                                       

        Therefore, while our order in this case m      ay not precisely enumerate the job titles that 
Schneider could take and comply with our order         , we find that our order   nevertheless provides a 
sufficient standard by which Schneider       can judge his ability to accept a particular position.    47
                                                                                                          
There are nearly limitless positions     that Schneider could safely take that have nothing to do with 
preparing financial statements of public companies. Some positions           , however , will involve duties 
that increase the likelihood that Schneider could engage in prohibited conduct, including the two 
that Schneider seeks to exempt from our order (audit committee member and CFO).                 48
                                                                                                   
Determining whether Schneider could accept such positions            will unavoidably involve a closer 
call. Our order reasonably places     Schneider on notice that, the more a prospective position is 
associated with the preparation of a company's financial statements, the more Schneider's 
acceptance of such a position without prior approval from the Commission would be done "at his 
peril."49
          For these reasons, we find no basis for modifying or clarifying our order.         50

(noting that, "[b]ecause of the significant role the audit committee plays in the filing of a public company's financial 
statement, . . . any accountant, while suspended or barred from practice under Rule 102(e) of the Commission's 
Rules of Practice, generally would not be eligible to serve as a financial expert [on an audit committee]"). Schneider 
interprets our comments in the immediately preceding authority about financial experts as supporting his argument 
that he may serve on an audit committee so long as he does not serve as a financial expert. If anything, however, 
these comments simply emphasize that, the greater one's involvement with a public company's financial statements, 
the greater the likelihood that one may violate a Rule 102(e) order.

        In denying Schneider's motion, w  e express no opinion on whether our Rule 102(e) order 
prohibits Schneider from taking any of the hypothetical positions he posits.       51
                                                                                      Nor do we  express 
any opinion on whether any of the positions Schneider held in the past, such as at CGI, violated 
our order, as those questions are not before us. Nor can we can find any basis, given the record 
before us, to conclude that Commission staff somehow misled Schneider about the scope or 
applicability of our Rule 102(e) order when he consented to our order's prohibitions. Schneider 
asserts, for example, that he lacked notice that he would be prohibited from serving on an audit 
committee or as a CFO because he was serving on three audit committees at the time he 
consented to our order. As described herein, however, we find that Rule 102 and case law 
interpreting that rule gave Schneider sufficient notice of what conduct our order proscribed, and 
nothing in the record before us provides a basis to conclude otherwise. Furthermore          to the extent 
Schneider is uncertain about an actual     position he may seek to take sometime in the future     , the 
Division has represented its willingness to provide guidance to Schneider regarding such 
potential positions. It is entirely possible, therefore, that Schneider "posits an injury that may 
never materialize."  52

application for modification of the Commission's order imposing remedial sanctions are 
DENIED.
