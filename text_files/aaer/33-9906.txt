(“Securities Act”), Sections 4C and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange

              to any person the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission in 
              any way, if that person is found . . . (1) not to possess the requisite qualifications

       In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the 
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings 
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these 
proceedings, which are admitted, and except as provided herein in Section V, Respondent consents 
to the entry of this Order Instituting Public Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings 
Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 4C and 21C of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making Findings,

                                                 III. 
 
                                                                                  3
        On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds  that:  
 
                                             Summary 

       Davis served as the chief financial officer (“CFO”) of the MusclePharm Corporation 
(“MSLP”) from July 3, 2012 until April 15, 2014.  MSLP is a Denver-based sports nutrition 
company that develops, manufactures, and markets sports nutrition products.  When Davis became 
CFO of MSLP, he discovered that MSLP had almost no internal controls, policies or procedures.  
Davis worked to bring MSLP’s accounting and disclosures in compliance with generally accepted 
accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Commission’s reporting requirements.  During his tenure 
as CFO, however, Davis failed to ensure sufficient internal controls were enacted and proper books 
and records were kept.  Additionally, Davis became aware of issues regarding undisclosed 
perquisites and undisclosed related parties, yet continued to sign MSLP Commission filings with 
misstatements and omissions.  As a result, between July 2012 and April 2014, when Davis ceased 
being CFO, MSLP had a series of accounting and disclosure failures that resulted in the company 
                                                                                                                                                             
               violated, or willfully aided and abetted the violation of, any provision of the 
               securities laws or the rules and regulations thereunder. 
        
2
 Rule 102(e)(1)(iii) provides, in pertinent part, that: 
 
               The Commission may . . . deny, temporarily or permanently, the privilege of 
               appearing or practicing before it . . . to any person who is found…to have 
               willfully violated, or willfully aided and abetted the violation of any provision of 
               the Federal securities laws or the rules and regulations thereunder.

   The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent’s Offer of Settlement and are not binding 
on any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

filing materially false and misleading filings with the Commission.  Specifically, as described 
further below, MSLP failed to disclose perquisite compensation to its executive officers, failed to 
disclose related party transactions, and failed to properly disclose manufacturing concentration, 
rent expense, and international sales in the financial statements in Commission filings that Davis 
reviewed, approved, and signed.   

                                          Respondent 

       1.     L. Gary Davis, CPA, was the CFO of MSLP from July 3, 2012 through April 15, 
2014.  Davis continued to be employed by MSLP in a special projects role until December 31, 
2014.  Davis has been licensed as a CPA in Ohio since 1985 and licensed in Idaho since 1992.   
        
                                        Relevant Entity 
        
       2.     MSLP is a Nevada corporation, based in Denver, Colorado, that manufactures and 
markets sports nutrition products.  From 2010 to present, MSLP’s common stock was registered 
with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and was quoted on the OTC 
Bulletin Board. 
 
              MSLP’s Failure to Disclose Perquisites from 2012 through 2014 
 
       3.     From 2012 through April 2014, MSLP materially understated its disclosed 
perquisites by approximately $285,000 or 66% in Forms 10-K and Forms S-1 filed with the 
Commission.  Davis reviewed, approved, and signed Forms 10-K and Forms S-1 while CFO.  
MSLP understated its disclosed perquisites in 2012 by approximately $214,000 or 93% and in 
2013 by approximately $71,000 or 35%.  From 2012 through 2013, MSLP’s chief executive 
officer (“CEO”) received approximately $152,000 of undisclosed perquisites.  The perquisites 
included perquisites related to meals, autos, apparel, and two golf club memberships. 

       4.     In July 2012, MSLP hired Davis as the CFO.  Davis realized that MSLP had almost 
no internal controls or policies or procedures.  Davis focused on maintaining MSLP’s daily 
operations and focused on developing the accounting department by hiring additional accounting 
staff with CPAs.  Soon after starting, however, Davis received information that MSLP was 
reimbursing executives for expenses, including a golf club membership and executive auto use, 
which were not disclosed as perquisites. 

       5.     In October 2012, Davis received a draft Form S-1, which included a summary 
compensation table that for the first time included disclosure amounts under the “All Other 
Compensation” column for 2009, 2010, and 2011.   A few weeks later, on October 26, MSLP filed 
the final Form S-1, which had removed items from the draft and failed to list several undisclosed 
perquisites.  Davis reviewed, approved, and signed the Form S-1. 

       6.     Beginning in November 2012, Davis began to implement travel and expense 
policies, which required MSLP employees to provide original receipts for their expenses.  Davis, 
however, did not implement any formal policies or procedures to ensure perquisites were being 

                                               3 
                                                 
---------------------Page 4---------------------

properly identified and disclosed.  Executives continued to submit reimbursement forms and make 
charges on company credit cards for personal items without providing original receipts.  MSLP 
continued paying for these items without properly identifying them as perquisites.  As a result, 
MSLP filed several Commission filings through April 2014, which failed to include complete 
disclosure of the perquisites.   

       7.     By summer 2013, Davis had begun conducting an internal review to determine the 
amount of undisclosed perquisites paid by MSLP to its executives since 2010.  In July 2013, Davis 
identified at least $100,000 of undisclosed perquisites.  Despite the perquisite review not being 
complete, MSLP filed a Form S-1 in August 2013 with incorrect perquisite disclosures that were 
identical to amounts previously disclosed before the internal review began.  Davis reviewed, 
approved, and signed the Form S-1. 
        
       8.     On March 31, 2014, MSLP filed its 2013 Form 10-K, which was reviewed, 
approved, and signed by Davis.  In the summary compensation table, MSLP set forth previously 
undisclosed perquisites for 2011 and 2012 totaling approximately $189,000 (previously 
undisclosed perquisites of $74,000 for 2011 and $115,000 for 2012).  The table also disclosed 
approximately $134,000 of perquisites in 2013.  These disclosures, however, still understated 
perquisites paid to MSLP executives.   
 
       9.     After Davis was no longer working for MSLP, on October 31, 2014, MSLP filed 
amended Forms 10-K for the years ended 2012 and 2013.  In total, MSLP failed to report 
perquisites totaling approximately $285,000 from 2012-2013. 
 
                MSLP’s Failure to Disclose Related Party Transactions with a  
                                       Major Customer 
 
       10.    From August 2012 through the end of the year, MSLP failed to disclose material 
related party transactions with a major customer in Commission filings that were reviewed, 
approved, and signed by Davis. 
        
       11.    In May 2011, MSLP had hired a new chief marketing officer (“CMO”).  The CMO 
was a former executive and co-founder of a major customer of MSLP.  Davis knew that the 
CMO’s brother remained the CEO of the major customer.  The CMO’s brother was also a greater 
than 10% owner of the major customer.  Additionally, Davis had previously been CFO of MSLP’s 
major customer (where the CMO’s brother was CEO) and acquired a 1.75% indirect interest in the 
major customer.  Davis also continued to perform work for the CEO of the major customer 
personally at no charge while he worked at MSLP. 
        
       12.    In August 2012, MSLP’s auditor requested that MSLP update an April 2012 memo 
it had provided to the auditors addressing whether the major customer was a related party requiring 
disclosure under GAAP, specifically due to the CMO’s or Davis’ employment.  The August memo 
concluded that transactions with the major customer did not require disclosure under GAAP.  The 
memo misapplied GAAP, which Davis, the only accountant signing the memo, did not correct.  
The memo also contained inaccurate information about the relationship between MSLP, the CMO, 
                                               4 
                                                 
---------------------Page 5---------------------

Davis, and the major customer.  As a result, MSLP failed to disclose transactions with its major 
customer as related party transactions in Commission filings until it filed its Form 10-Q for the 
quarter ended March 30, 2013 in May 2013. 
 
      Other Financial Statement, Accounting, and Disclosure Failures from 2012-2013 
 
       13.    MSLP, while Davis was CFO, failed to disclose that it had one supplier that 
accounted for nearly 100% of its product purchases in its 2012 Commission filings as required 
under GAAP.   
        
       14.    MSLP, while Davis was CFO, failed to disclose $100,000 of rent expense related 
to an August 2012 aircraft lease agreement in its 2012 Form 10-K as required under GAAP.  As a 
result, MSLP understated its disclosed rent expense by 23%.  In addition, MSLP, while Davis was 
CFO, instead of recognizing no gain or loss on the settlement since the $100,000 paid equaled the 
$100,000 owed per the lease agreement, MSLP recorded a $35,000 gain in 2013 related to the 
January 2013 settlement.   
        
       15.    MSLP, while Davis was CFO, failed to disclose the amount of its international 
sales in its 2012 and 2013 Commission filings as required under GAAP.  MSLP’s international 
sales accounted for 30% for 2012 and 31% for 2013.   
 
                        Books, Records, and Lack of Internal Controls 
 
       16.    Because MSLP improperly recorded and/or reported its perquisites, related parties, 
manufacturing concentration, leases, and international sales, its books, records and accounts did 
not, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect its transactions and dispositions of assets. 
        
       17.    In addition, MSLP failed to implement internal accounting controls relating to its 
perquisites, related parties, manufacturing concentration, leases, and international sales, which 
were sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that transactions were recorded as necessary to 
permit the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain the 
accountability of assets.    
                                            Violations 
 
                                                                          4
       18.    As a result of the conduct described above, Davis willfully   violated Sections  
1 7(a ) (2) and 17(a)(3) of th e Securities Act   and caused MSLP’s violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 
17(a)(3) of the Securities Act, which make it unlawful for any person in the offer or sale of any

  A willful violation of the securities laws means merely “‘that the person charged with the duty 
knows what he is doing.’”  Wonsover v. SEC, 205 F.3d 408, 414 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (quoting 
Hughes v. SEC, 174 F.2d 969, 977 (D.C. Cir. 1949)).  There is no requirement that the actor 
“‘also be aware that he is violating one of the Rules or Acts.’”  Id. (quoting Gearhart & Otis, 
Inc. v. SEC, 348 F.2d 798, 803 (D.C. Cir. 1965)).

securities by the use of interstate commerce to obtain money or property by means of any untrue 
statement of a material fact or any omission to state a material fact necessary in order to make the 
statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and to 
engage in any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a 
fraud or deceit upon the purchaser.   
 
       19.    As a result of the conduct described above, Davis caused MSLP’s violations of 
Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act Rules 13a-1, 13a-13, and 12b-20 thereunder, which require 
every issuer of a security registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act file with the 
Commission information, documents, and annual and quarterly reports as the Commission may 
require, and mandate that periodic reports contain such further material information as may be 
necessary to make the required statements not misleading.  
        
       20.    As a result of the conduct described above, Davis caused MSLP’s violations of 
Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act, which requires reporting companies to make and keep 
books, records and accounts, which in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect their 
transactions and dispositions of assets. 
        
       21.    As a result of the conduct described above, Davis caused MSLP’s violations of 
Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and willfully violated Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, which 
require all reporting companies to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls 
sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the 
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain the accountability of 
assets; and prohibit persons from directly or indirectly falsifying or causing to be falsified any 
book, record, or account. 
 
                                               IV. 
                                                  
       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in Respondent Davis’ Offer. 
 
       Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that: 
 
       A.      Davis shall cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any 
future violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act and Sections 13(a), 
13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, and 13b2-1 
promulgated thereunder.   
 
       B.      Davis is denied the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission as 
an accountant.   
 
       C.      After two years from the date of this order, Respondent may request that the 
Commission consider his reinstatement by submitting an application (attention: Office of the 
Chief Accountant) to resume appearing or practicing before the Commission as: 
      
                                                6

               1.     a preparer or reviewer, or a person responsible for the preparation or 
                      review, of any public company’s financial statements that are filed with 
                      the Commission.  Such an application must satisfy the Commission that 
                      Respondent’s work in his practice before the Commission will be 
                      reviewed either by the independent audit committee of the public company 
                      for which he works or in some other acceptable manner, as long as he 
                      practices before the Commission in this capacity; and/or 
 
               2.     an independent accountant.  Such an application must satisfy the 
                      Commission that: 
      
                      (a)     Respondent, or the public accounting firm with which he is 
                              associated, is registered with the Public Company Accounting 
                              Oversight Board (“Board”) in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley 
                              Act of 2002, and such registration continues to be effective; 
 
                      (b)     Respondent, or the registered public accounting firm with which he 
                              is associated, has been inspected by the Board and that inspection 
                              did not identify any criticisms of or potential defects in the 
                              respondent’s or the firm’s quality control system that would 
                              indicate that the respondent will not receive appropriate 
                              supervision; 

                      (c)     Respondent has resolved all disciplinary issues with the Board, and 
                              has complied with all terms and conditions of any sanctions 
                              imposed by the Board (other than reinstatement by the 
                              Commission); and 
 
                      (d)     Respondent acknowledges his responsibility, as long as 
                              Respondent appears or practices before the Commission as an 
                              independent accountant, to comply with all requirements of the 
                              Commission and the Board, including, but not limited to, all 
                              requirements relating to registration, inspections, concurring 
                              partner reviews and quality control standards.   
 
       D.      The Commission will consider an application by Respondent to resume appearing 
or practicing before the Commission provided that his state CPA license is current and he has 
resolved all other disciplinary issues with the applicable state boards of accountancy.  However, 
if state licensure is dependent on reinstatement by the Commission, the Commission will 
consider an application on its other merits.  The Commission’s review may include consideration 
of, in addition to the matters referenced above, any other matters relating to Respondent’s 
character, integrity, professional conduct, or qualifications to appear or practice before the 
Commission.
