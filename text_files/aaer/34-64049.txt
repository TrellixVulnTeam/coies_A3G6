                                              I. 
 
       The Securities and Exchange Commission deems it appropriate to issue an order of 
forthwith suspension of Sujata Sachdeva (Sachdeva) pursuant to Rule 102(e)(2) of the 
Commissions Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R.  200.102(e)(2)].1
                                                             
        
 
                                             II. 
 
              In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Sachdeva has submitted an Offer of 
Settlement (the Offer) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the purpose 
of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the Commission, or to 
which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings herein, except as 
to the Commissions jurisdiction over her and the subject matter of these proceedings, and the 
findings contained in Section III.2. below, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry

                                              III. 
 
              On the basis of this Order and Respondents Offer, the Commission finds that: 
 
       1.           Sachdeva, age 46, is a resident of Mequon, Wisconsin.  From 1992 through her 
termination on December 23, 2009, Sachdeva was Principal Accounting Officer, Secretary, and 
Vice-President of Finance of Koss Corporation (Koss).  Koss securities are registered pursuant 
to Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and trade on the NASDAQ Global 
Market.     
 
       2.           On July 16, 2010, Sachdeva pleaded guilty to six counts of wire fraud, in 
violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 1343, before the United States District Court for the Eastern 
District of Wisconsin in United States v. Sujata Sachdeva, Case No. 10-CR-6.  On November 17, 
2010, the court in the criminal case entered judgment and sentenced Sachdeva to a prison term of 
132 months, followed by 3 years of supervised release, and ordered Sachdeva to make restitution 
in the amount of $34 million. 
        
       3.           The counts of the criminal indictment to which Sachdeva pleaded guilty alleged, 
inter alia, that Sachdeva defrauded Koss and obtained money and property by means of material 
false and fraudulent pretenses and representations and did knowingly cause wire 
communications to be transmitted in interstate commerce for the purpose of executing her 
scheme. 
        
        
                                              III. 
 
       In view of the foregoing, the Commission finds that Sachdeva has been convicted of a 
felony within the meaning of Rule 102(e)(2) of the Commissions Rules of Practice. 
 
       Accordingly, it is ORDERED that Sujata Sachdeva is forthwith suspended from 
appearing or practicing before the Commission pursuant to Rule 102(e)(2) of the Commissions 
Rules of Practice.  
 
       By the Commission. 
                                             
 
 
 
                                             
                                            Elizabeth M. Murphy 
                                            Secretary 
 
 
        
                                               2
