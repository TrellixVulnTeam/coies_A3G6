The Commission finds the following:1
RESPONDENT
A. JDN Realty Corporation is a Maryland corporation with its principal place of business in Atlanta, Georgia.
JDN Realty is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is a reporting company pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act.
JDN Realty is a real estate investment trust specializing in the development and management of retail shopping centers.
RELATED ENTITY
B. JDN Development Company, Inc. ("JDN Development"), a Delaware corporation, has been a subsidiary of JDN Realty since its formation in December 1994.
From December 1994 until early 2001, JDN Realty owned 99% of the economic interest and 1% of the voting interest in JDN Development.
JDN Realty's chief executive officer owned the remaining 1% economic interest and 99% voting interest from December 1994 through April 2000.
JDN Realty conducts most of its development activities through JDN Development.
UNDISCLOSED COMPENSATION AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
C. Beginning in December 1994, JDN Realty's then chief executive officer, who also served as the president of JDN Development (the "chief executive officer"), a consultant who joined JDN Development as an officer in June 1996 and later became senior vice president (the "senior vice president"), and a JDN Development vice president (the "vice president") engaged in a series of actions that concealed from JDN Realty's officers, board of directors, accounting department, and auditors certain compensation and payments to the senior vice president and the vice president.
This conduct continued until its discovery by employees of JDN Realty in late 1999 as part of JDN Realty's project review process.
The chief executive officer, the senior vice president, and the vice president resigned from their respective offices on February 14, 2000, at the request of JDN Realty and its board of directors.
The chief executive officer resigned from all remaining positions with JDN Realty and JDN Development as of April 13, 2000.
D. The chief executive officer, the senior vice president, and the vice president concealed certain compensation by structuring real estate purchase transactions such that the third parties who sold land to JDN Development also disbursed cash or conveyed land to the senior vice president and the vice president through a Georgia corporation they owned (the "Recipient Company").
E. In nine JDN Development real estate purchase transactions, the sellers of the land made cash disbursements totaling $1,736,452 to the senior vice president and the vice president through the Recipient Company.
F. In ten JDN Development real estate purchase transactions, the sellers conveyed part of the real estate paid for by JDN Development to the senior vice president and the vice president through the Recipient Company.
In another transaction, the real estate was conveyed from the seller to JDN Development, and then from JDN Development to the senior vice president and the vice president through the Recipient Company pursuant to a deed signed by the chief executive officer.
These parcels had estimated fair market values totaling approximately $2,800,101.
G. JDN Realty's books and records did not accurately reflect the foregoing transactions because the chief executive officer, the senior vice president, and the vice president failed to disclose information concerning the transactions to JDN Realty's accounting department.
H. JDN Realty's annual reports filed on Form 10-K for the years 1994 and 1995 failed to disclose accurately all compensation paid to the vice president.
JDN Realty's annual reports filed on Form 10-K for the years 1996 through 1998 failed to disclose accurately all compensation paid to the senior vice president and the vice president.
I. JDN Realty's proxy statements filed on Schedule 14A on April 4, 1995, and April 7, 1996, failed to disclose accurately all compensation paid to the vice president.
JDN Realty's proxy statements filed on Schedule 14A on March 28, 1997, April 3, 1998, and April 22, 1999, failed to disclose accurately all compensation paid to the senior vice president and the vice president.
J. JDN Realty's 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997 audited annual financial statements and its unaudited financial statements for the quarters ended March 31, 1998, and December 31, 1998, were not prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") because certain compensation to the senior vice president and the vice president was not accurately recorded on JDN Realty's books and records.
The inaccurate financial statements were included in JDN Realty's filings on Form 10-K for the years 1994 through 1997 and on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 1998, and December 31, 1998.
K. JDN Realty failed to disclose that the senior vice president and the vice president were related parties to certain of JDN Realty's transactions because these former officers failed to disclose their interests to JDN Realty.
The senior vice president and the vice president each owned significant interests in a partnership that purchased real property from JDN Development for $2 million in April 1996.
In addition, the senior vice president and the vice president each owned a 25% interest in a company that sold over $650,000 in surveying services to JDN Realty and JDN Development in a series of transactions during the period from 1995 through 1998.
JDN Realty failed to disclose these transactions in proxy statements filed on Schedule 14A on April 7, 1996, March 28, 1997, April 3, 1998, and April 22, 1999, and in its annual reports filed on Form 10-K for the years 1995 through 1998.
L. JDN Realty failed to disclose that the chief executive officer was involved as a related party to a series of JDN Realty transactions because this former officer failed to disclose his interests to JDN Realty.
The chief executive officer held a 99% interest in a company that owned an airplane, which JDN Realty and JDN Development occasionally used.
JDN Realty and JDN Development paid that company $61,801 in 1996; $238,246 in 1997; and $285,522 in 1998.
JDN Realty failed to disclose these transactions in proxy statements filed on Schedule 14A on March 28, 1997, April 3, 1998, and April 22, 1999, and in its annual reports filed on Form 10-K for the years 1996, 1997, and 1998.
M. During the years 1994 through 1999, JDN Realty failed to maintain internal accounting controls sufficient to ensure that its financial statements were prepared in conformity with GAAP.
