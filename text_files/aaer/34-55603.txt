      The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission” or “SEC”) deems it appropriate

Commission’s Rules of Practice.1

                                               II. 

       In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the 
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings 
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these 
proceedings, and the findings contained in Section III.3. below, which are admitted, Respondent 
consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Rule 102(e) 
of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions 
(“Order”), as set forth below.   

                                              III. 

       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that:  

       1.     Vinson, age 47, of Fort Worth, Texas, is an attorney licensed in Texas.  From 
October 2003 through January 29, 2004, Vinson was president and chairman of the board of 
directors of Moliris Corp. (“Moliris”). From January 29, 2004 through August 2005, Vinson 
functioned as the de facto principal executive and principal financial officer of Moliris.     

       2.     Moliris, now known as Digifonica International Corp., 2
                                                                      is a Florida corporation 
with its corporate offices, at relevant times, in Fort Worth, Texas.  Moliris’s common stock is 
registered with the Commission under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act.  Between October 2003 
and August 2005, Moliris was controlled by Vinson and Clyde R. Parks.  Except for a brief period 
between November 2003 and July 2004 in which Moliris manufactured corrugated boxes, it was 
essentially a public shell company with little or no operations. 

       3.     On December 6, 2006, the Commission filed a complaint against Vinson in SEC v. 
Lindsey P. Vinson and Clyde R. Parks (Civil Action No. 3-06CV2240-D, USDC, N. D. Tx., Dallas 
Div.).  On December 11, 2006, the court entered a final judgment (“Judgment”) permanently 
enjoining Vinson, by consent, from future violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the 
Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder, and aiding and abetting violations 
of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 
13a-13 thereunder.  Vinson was also ordered to pay $200,597 in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, 
plus prejudgment interest of $29,321, among other relief.  Pursuant to the Judgment, Vinson was 
also ordered to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $200,000, prohibited from acting as an officer 
or director of any U.S. public company, and prohibited from participating in any penny stock 
offerings. 

       4.     The Commission’s complaint alleged that from about October 2003 through August 
2005, Vinson, who had been previously enjoined by a federal court from violating the federal 

2 
       Effective July 5, 2006, the company changed its name to “Digifonica International Corp.”  For purposes of 
this Offer, any reference to “Moliris” should also be construed as a reference to Digifoncia International Corp. 

                                                2

securities laws, with the assistance of Parks: (a) concealed Vinson’s control of Moliris, (b) 
approved the filing of false and misleading Commission reports, and (c) in an attempt to profit 
from his activities, arranged for Moliris’s stock to be listed and publicly traded on the OTC 
Bulletin Board (“OTC-BB”) without disclosing his continuing role at Moliris, his SEC disciplinary 
background and his prior bankruptcies.  After having obtained the OTC-BB listing, Vinson 
participated in the public release of false information regarding a change in Moliris’s line of 
business and its business prospects.  While engaging in the alleged misconduct, Vinson used 
Moliris’s bank accounts to pay a variety of personal expenses. 

                                               IV. 

       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
impose the sanction agreed to in Respondent Vinson’s Offer. 

       Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that Vinson is suspended 
from appearing or practicing as an attorney before the Commission.   

 By       the Commission.
