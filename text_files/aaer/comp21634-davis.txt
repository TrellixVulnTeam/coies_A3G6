ROBERT W. DAVIS,                                   
 
  Defendant. 

 
              Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission or SEC) 

alleges as follows: 

                                       SUMMARY 

 
       1.     The SEC brings this action for various accounting violations involving Dell Inc. 

(Dell) from 2001 to 2005.  Dells fraudulent and improper accounting during this period 

wrongfully made it appear that Dell was consistently meeting Wall Street earnings targets and 

reducing its operating expenses as a percentage of revenue.  Dell committed the accounting 

violations through the conduct of its most senior former accounting executives.     

       2.     Robert W. Davis (Davis), one of Dells most senior former accounting personnel, 

and others maintained a number of cookie jar reserves that they used to cover shortfalls in Dells 

operating results from FY02 to FY05.  Through this improper accounting, Davis materially 

misrepresented Dells financial results.  As a result, Dell was forced to restate its financial 

statements for its fiscal years 2003 through 2006, including the interim periods within those years, 

and Q1FY07, with a cumulative balance sheet adjustment for periods before fiscal year 2003 (the 

Restatement).

       3.     Davis, by engaging in the conduct alleged below, violated Section 17(a)(2) and (3) 

of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)(2) and (3)], Section 13(b)(5) 

of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78m(b)(5)] and Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 [17 C.F.R. §§ 

240.13b2-1 and 240.13b2-2], promulgated thereunder, and aided and abetted Dells violations of 

Section 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78m(a), 

78m(b)(2)(A) and 78m(b)(2)(B) ], and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 [17 C.F.R. §§ 240.12b-20, 

240.13a-1, 240.13a-13], promulgated thereunder, pursuant to Section 20(e) of the Exchange Act 

[15 U.S.C. § 78t(e)].  Unless restrained and enjoined, Davis will in the future violate such 

provisions. 

                               JURISDICTION AND VENUE 

       4.     This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(b) and 22(a) of 

the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b) and 77v(a)], and Sections 21(d), 21(e) and 27 of the 

Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u(e) and 78aa]. 

       5.     Davis, directly or indirectly, has made use of the means and instrumentalities of 

interstate commerce, of the mails, or of the facilities of a national securities exchange in 

connection with acts, practices and courses of business alleged in this Complaint. 

Venue is proper in this District pursuant to Section 22 of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v] and 

Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa] because, among other reasons, certain of the 

transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business constituting the violations alleged herein 

occurred within this District.

                                       DEFENDANT 

       6.     Robert W. Davis, CPA, 51, resides in Laurel Hollow, New York.  Davis joined 

Dell in 1996.  In 2001 he was named Vice President of Corporate Planning and Reporting.  In 

November 2002, Davis was named Vice President of Corporate Finance and Chief Accounting 

Officer (CAO), a position he retained until he voluntarily left Dell in February 2005 to become 

CFO of Computer Associates, Inc.  Earlier in his career, Davis, a Certified Public Accountant 

(CPA) licensed in Virginia, worked as an auditor at what was then Price Waterhouse from 1980 

to 1991, where he rose to the level of senior manager and worked in the SEC Services Department 

in the firms national office.  Davis holds a bachelors degree in Commerce and Accounting from 

the University of Virginia and an MBA from Columbia University.  During his time as Vice 

President of Corporate Planning and Reporting, Davis reviewed certain of Dells annual reports on 

Forms 10-K and quarterly reports on Forms 10-Q filed with the Commission.  During his time as 

Chief Accounting Officer, Davis reviewed, approved and signed Dells annual reports on Forms 

10-K and quarterly reports on Forms 10-Q filed with the Commission.  He served as a member of 

Dells Disclosure Review Committee (DRC) from November 2002 until February 2005.   

                                  RELEVANT ENTITIES 

       7.     Dell Inc. (Dell) is a Fortune 50 company in the business of providing electronic 

products, including mobility products, desktop PCs, peripherals, servers, networking equipment, 

and storage.  Dell also offers services, including software, infrastructure technology, consulting 

and applications, and business process services.  Dell was incorporated in Delaware in 1984 and is 

based in Round Rock, Texas.  Since July 2006, Dells common stock was registered with the 

Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and is traded on the NASDAQ Global 

Select Market.  During the prior relevant period, Dells common stock was registered with the 

                                              3

Commission under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and quoted on the Nasdaq National Market 

System. 

       8.     PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PWC) is a national public accounting firm 

with its headquarters in New York, New York.  PWC audited Dells financial statements 

throughout the relevant period. 

                                  DELLS FISCAL YEAR 

       9.     Dells fiscal year is the 52 or 53 week period ending on the Friday closest to 

January 31.  Each quarter runs for either 13 or 14 weeks, also ending on Fridays. 

                            THE ACCOUNTING VIOLATIONS 

       10.    For approximately four years, from FY02 to FY05, Dell engaged in improper 

accounting involving cookie jar reserves and other manipulations of reserve accounts.  As 

explained more fully below, these manipulations were undertaken to meet consensus earnings 

targets or to misstate materially other important financial metrics.  These manipulations not only 

materially misstated Dells financial results, but caused additional material misstatements in Dells 

annual and quarterly reports filed with the Commission during the period.   

       11.    Contrary to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Dell created and 

maintained excess accruals in multiple reserve accounts.  Dell used the excess accruals in these 

reserves to offset the financial statement impacts of future expenses.  During this period, Davis 

was actively involved in these manipulations. 

       12.    As set forth in detail below, Dell manipulated reserves including a) the Strat Fund 

and other Corporate Contingencies; b) accrued relocation accruals; c) a Corporate restructuring 

reserve; d) several reserves in EMEA, one of Dells overseas business units; e)  bonus and 

profit-sharing accruals; and f) an under-accrued restructuring Las Cimas reserve.  

       13.    The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement of Financial 

                                              4

         Case 1:10-cv-01464-RJL   Document 1    Filed 08/27/10   Page 5 of 34

Accounting Standards No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies (SFAS 5), and the related 

interpretations are among the principal GAAP provisions that govern the recognition of loss 

accruals and reserves.  These accounting principles provide, among other things, that a loss accrual 

should be recognized with a charge to income when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.  

The maintenance of reserves for general or unspecified business risks (sometimes called general 

reserves or cookie jar reserves) is not permitted under GAAP.  Further, the accounting 

principles generally provide, among other things, that any over-accrual of a reserve should be 

reversed into the income statement as soon as the over-accrual is discovered. 

       14.    The impacts of Dells reserve manipulations materially misstated Dells operating 

results.  In certain quarters, the manipulations enabled Dell to meet analyst consensus estimates for 

earnings per share (EPS).  The manipulations also enabled Dell to misstate materially the trend 

and amount of operating income from Q3FY03 through Q1FY05 of its EMEA segment, an 

important business unit that Dell highlighted.  Instead of increasing every quarter from Q2FY03 

through Q1FY05, EMEAs operating income varied substantially. 

       15.    The reserve manipulations also allowed Dell materially to misstate its operating 

expenses (OpEx) as a percentage of revenue (OpEx percentage or OpEx ratio), and the 

quarter to quarter trend in this ratio, for over three years, from about Q2FY02 through about 

Q2FY05.  The OpEx ratio was an important financial metric that the Company itself highlighted.  

As reported, Dells OpEx ratio during this period was an artificial and fabricated pattern, as shown 

below:

                                 Operating Expense (as a percentage of revenue)

            11.00%

            10.75%

            10.50%

            10.25%

            10.00%

             9.75%

             9.50%

                        FY02                FY03                 FY04             FY05

                                                    as reported
                                                                                                

 
In the MD&A of every Form 10-Q from Q1FY03 through Q2FY05, and in other public statements, 

Dell highlighted each decrease in the ratio as achieving a record low, and each instance where 

the ratio remained flat as maintaining or continuing the record low.  Dell attributed such 

records to reported decreases in the ratio of 0.3% in Q1FY03 (from 10.2 % to 9.9%); 0.2% in 

Q2FY04 (from 9.8% to 9.6%), and just 0.1% in Q1FY04 from (9.9% to 9.8%).  Dell attributed 

achieving or continuing the record lows to cost reduction initiatives or a focus on cost 

controls.  In fact, Dells reported OpEx ratio during this period was impacted by accounting 

manipulations, and the actual ratio generally varied materially from quarter to quarter during this 

period. 

       16.     Dell repeatedly told investors and analysts that its business model was superior to 

its competitors models.  Dells senior management used the companys ability to meet or exceed 

analysts consensus to support this claim.

                                                                                           Q1

                                                                                           Q2

                                                                                           Q3

       17.    Analyst reports reflect that Dells apparent ability to consistently meet analysts 

consensus for EPS was important to investors.  For example, in February 2003, a Goldman Sachs 

research report stated, consistency is the hallmark of Dells financials.  In May, 2003, Dells 

Head of the Investor Relations department informed Dell senior management, commenting on a 

prior email from the department forwarding analyst comments for Q1FY04:  The consistency of 

messaging throughout these notes is at a level I have never seen for any company.  While I know at 

times we grow weary of saying the same thing over and over again, this consistency of message 

and performance drove analysts to raise price targets absent an increase in estimates. . . .  Dells 

CEO replied: Its a beautiful thing. ☺  In November 2003, Dells Investor Relations department 

informed the companys senior management that there have been no upgrades or downgrades, but 

[an analyst] reduced his risk rating to medium risk from high risk based on our historical earnings 

consistency.  Also, in February 2005, a Bear Stearns report lauded Dell as a core holding in any 

tech portfolio given its consistency in achieving operating targets. 

       a.          The Strat Fund and Other Corporate Contingencies 

       18.    From about FY02 to FY05, Dell maintained a cookie jar reserve, contrary to GAAP, 

called the Strat Fund (short for Strategic Fund).  Davis and others in Dells corporate finance 

group referred to the Strat Fund and other specified improper cookie jar reserves maintained by 

Corporate as contingencies, and they will be referred to herein as Corporate Contingencies.  

The Corporate Contingencies consisted of excess, unsupported balances that resided in Corporate 

accounts, including an other accrued liabilities account that Dell personnel sometimes referred 

to by its number, 24990.  The Strat Fund was a sub-account, or subset, of account 24990.  Dell 

used the Corporate Contingencies primarily to reduce its future operating expenses by releasing 

these excess accruals to offset unforeseen expenses. 

                                               7 
---------------------Page 8---------------------

         Case 1:10-cv-01464-RJL   Document 1    Filed 08/27/10   Page 8 of 34

       19.    Davis planned and issued instructions regarding Dells build-up and use of the 

Corporate Contingencies.  His accounting decisions and actions concerning the reserves were 

contrary to GAAP.  Davis instructed subordinates that when excess reserves were identified  e.g., 

previously-reserved amounts no longer needed for bona fide liabilities  the subordinates were to 

check with him about the disposition of the excess reserves instead of releasing them to the income 

statement.  When the excess accruals were significant, Davis often directed the subordinates to 

transfer them to account 24990.  Davis viewed the Corporate Contingencies as a way to offset 

future liabilities.  He substantially participated in the earmarking of the excess accruals for 

various purposes.    

       20.    At Daviss direction, certain of his subordinates tracked the Corporate 

Contingencies in schedules entitled Estimated Contingencies in Corporate (hereinafter 

Corporate Contingency Schedules).  Davis asked subordinates to provide him with these 

schedules at least once per quarter.  The improper reserves were reflected in the schedules in a 

column labeled Available Balance.  The Corporate Contingency Schedules typically reflected 

total available balances in the range of $20 million to $30 million.  The highest available balance 

was $39 million in June/July 2003.  The lowest available balance was $3 million in September 

2002.   

       21.    In the 14 quarters from Q1FY02 through Q2FY05, Dell made at least 23 releases 

from the Strat Fund and other corporate contingencies, 16 of which were recorded after quarters 

ended, while Dell was in the process of closing its books.  In a Restatement filed in October 2007, 

Dell reversed all Strat Fund activity and all excess balances for the other reserves that appeared on 

the corporate contingency schedules.

       22.    An example of how Dell used its Corporate Contingency general reserves to offset 

unforeseen expenses involved the release of an excess tax reserve from Q4FY03 to offset the 

impact of a litigation settlement in Q2FY04.  At the end of FY03, Dell Japan had a tax reserve of 

about $17 million that Dell concluded was unnecessary.  The tax reserve was referred to as the 

Japanese Consumption Tax, or JCT, reserve.  Under GAAP, Dell should have released the 

entire $17 million excess accrual to its income statement by the end of FY03.  Instead, during the 

FY03 close, Dell released only $5 million of the JCT reserve to income, and transferred about 

$12 million of the excess accrual to account 24990.  The Japanese Consumption Tax reserve was 

unsupported in Q4FY03 and should have been released by the end of FY03, yet only a portion of it 

was released, and that the balance was improperly carried over to FY04 and transferred to 

Corporate.   

       23.    On April 7, 2003, Dells Assistant Corporate Controller sent Davis an email with 

the subject line JCT Reserve Transferred to Corp Books that stated, Following up . . . we are 

carrying a remaining reserve on Corps balance sheet of roughly $12M.  The next day, the 

Assistant Corporate Controller forwarded the email to Davis with the additional message, The 

amount is $12M and its on [a Corporate Planning Managers] balance sheet in [account 24990].  

On April 16, 2003 (Q1FY04), Davis received an email with the current Corporate Contingency 

Schedule that listed the $12 million excess Japanese Consumption Tax reserve as an Available 

Balance.  The excess tax reserve had been added to the Corporate Contingency Schedule as an 

Available Balance at Daviss direction. 

       24.    Towards the end of Q2FY04, Dell agreed to settle litigation (the Tulip Litigation) 

at an estimated cost to Dell, net of insurance, of $9.3 million.  Dell had not established a reserve for 

this settlement.

       25.    On August 1, 2003, Davis received an email with the current Corporate 

Contingency Schedule.  The Japanese Consumption Tax reserve was listed on the schedule in the 

amount of about $12 million, with about $7 million in the Required Funds column and about 

$5 million in the Available Balance column.  The Description column stated that the 

$7 million was required to Cover Tulip Settlement in July. On August 7, 2003, late in the 

process of closing its books for Q2FY04, Dell deflected the $9.3 million impact of the Tulip 

Settlement by releasing $7.1 million from the excess Japanese Consumption Tax reserve that had 

been transferred to the Corporate Contingencies, $700,000 from the Strat Fund, and $1.5 million 

of excess from an accrued legal services account.  On the same day, Dell released the remaining 

$5 million of the excess Japanese Consumption Tax reserve to provide an additional boost to 

Dells operating results.   

       26.    The Japanese Consumption Tax reserve was an excess accrual from a prior period 

that Dell released in Q2FY04 to offset the impact of the settlement of the Tulip Litigation and 

otherwise to provide an additional boost to Dells operating results.  On August 8, 2003, Davis 

received a Corporate Contingency Schedule that was As of August 8, 2003.  The schedule 

showed the Japanese Consumption Tax reserve as having been reduced by $12 million with the 

description, Cover Tulip Settlement $7m.

       b.          Other Cookie Jar Reserves Identified in R&O Schedules 

       27.    In addition to the Strat Fund and the Corporate Contingency Schedules, from time 

to time, Dells Corporate Reporting group assembled a list of items that could help or hinder Dells 

efforts to meet its financial targets.  Corporate Reporting compiled the items in spreadsheets called 

Risks and Opportunities Schedules (R&O Schedules).  Dells Assistant Corporate Controller 

and his subordinates prepared the schedules when Davis asked for them.  Like the Corporate 

Contingency Schedules, the R&O Schedules included excess reserves that Dell was carrying from 

period to period.  Unlike the Corporate Contingency Schedules, which were limited only to 

Corporate accounts, the R&O Schedules included non-Corporate accounts, such as excess reserves 

maintained in Dells business units.  One item listed on several R&O Schedules involved accrued 

relocation accruals. 

       28.    During the Q2FY02 close in August 2001, a payroll and benefits accounting 

manager informed Dells Assistant Controller that she had identified excess relocation accruals of 

$6M.  Under GAAP, Dell should have released the $6 million as a reduction of operating expenses 

in Q2FY02.  Instead, the Assistant Controller told Dells CFO and Davis that he had directed that 

it be carried into Q3FY02, when he would be working to determine whether that account had even 

more excess accruals.  The R&O Schedule that the Assistant Corporate Controller and his team 

prepared for Davis in Q3FY02 reflects the $6 million excess accrual as an item available to reduce 

Dells operating expenses in that quarter.  Dell released the $6 million excess accrual in Q3FY02.  

In its Restatement, Dell moved the income effect of the release of the excess accrual from Q3FY02 

back to Q2FY02. 

       29.    In March 2002 (Q1FY03), the payroll and benefits accounting manager again 

informed the Assistant Controller that Dell had excess relocation accruals.  She told him that she 

                                              11

        Case 1:10-cv-01464-RJL   Document 1    Filed 08/27/10   Page 12 of 34

had identified another $5 million in excess accruals and asked when she should release these 

excess reserves.  The Assistant Corporate Controller responded, My sense is that it will be okay to 

reverse the unneeded accrual at EOQ [end of quarter].  This would have been the appropriate 

treatment of the excess reserve under GAAP.  The Assistant Corporate Controller forwarded his 

response to Davis.  On April 11, 2002, Davis asked a Corporate Planning employee how the $5 

million in excess accruals had been handled in a recent financial forecasting document.  The 

employee replied that it was not reflected in the document, but that Dell could flow it through the 

P&L in Q1 if needed.   Dell did not release the excess reserve in Q1 or Q2.  The excess accrual 

ultimately was released in Q3FY03, understating Dells operating expenses (OpEx) and 

overstating its operating income that quarter. 

       c.           Dells Improper Establishment and Use of Restructuring Reserves 

       30.    FASB Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94-3, Liability Recognition for 

Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity, (including Certain 

Costs Incurred in a Restructuring) (EITF 94-3), and the related interpretations are among the 

principal GAAP provisions that relate to accounting and disclosure of certain costs and liabilities 

for restructuring activities, which include such things as involuntary employee terminations, 

contract terminations, and efforts to consolidate or close facilities.  These principles allow 

companies to accrue for restructuring expenses to be incurred in future quarters when certain 

conditions are met, such as commitment to a formal restructuring plan, notification to affected 

employees and establishment of a probable and reasonable estimate of the anticipated 

restructuring costs.  Further, the principles provide that related restructuring reserves should be 

regularly re-evaluated and any amounts no longer needed for the original purpose reversed to 

income.  Retaining excess reserve amounts or using them for purposes other than that for which 

                                               12

they were originally intended is not permitted under GAAP.  Furthermore, costs incurred, but not 

specifically contemplated in the original estimate, must be charged to income in the period in 

which the expense is incurred. 

       31.    In Q2FY02 (ended August 3, 2001), Dell recorded a $482 million charge to income 

and established related restructuring liabilities in various reserve accounts.  In its Form 10-Q for 

the quarter ended August 3, 2001, Dell disclosed that it recorded the charge to reduce its workforce 

and exit certain activities.  Under GAAP, the amount of the charge should have been based on 

Dells best estimates of future qualifying restructuring costs.  If Dell subsequently determined that 

amounts in the reserves were no longer needed for their originally intended purposes, or exceeded 

what the company believed would ultimately be needed, Dell should have released those excess 

amounts to the companys income statement. 

       32.    Dell improperly built excess accruals into the reserve at its inception, and from 

Q3FY02 to Q3FY04, maintained excess amounts from the restructuring reserve.  Over at least six 

quarters during this period, Dell used this excess to offset the impacts of unrelated period costs 

resulting in a material misrepresentation of its operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. 

       33.    In November 2001, Dells Assistant Controller informed Dells CFO of excess in 

the restructuring reserve and Dells CFO instructed Davis and Dells Assistant Controller not to 

take a negative charge (i.e., reverse excess amounts back to the income statement in keeping 

with GAAP) for any excess amounts in the reserve. 

       34.    Following the CFOs instruction not to take a negative charge, the Assistant 

Controller and Davis directed, over the course of several periods, the transfer of the excess 

restructuring accruals to account number 24990, discussed in greater detail above, where it 

operated as a general reserve.  Davis subsequently used re-designated funds to offset expenses 

                                               13

        Case 1:10-cv-01464-RJL   Document 1    Filed 08/27/10   Page 14 of 34

unrelated to Dells restructuring.  For example, in Q3FY04, Dell funded an $8.6 million required 

payment to the IRS relating to Dells 401(k) plan using excess accruals from the restructuring 

reserve.  In the prior quarter, the Assistant Controller informed Dells CFO that he and Davis had 

held back $10 million of redesignated special charge reserves to make this payment.  

       35.     Although the utilization of excess from the restructuring reserve in this manner 

was not in conformance with GAAP,  Davis signed one or more management representation letters 

to PWC in which he certified that Dells consolidated financial statements complied with GAAP.  

For example, Davis signed the representation letter to PWC dated February 14, 2002, which 

falsely stated that [t]he restructuring accrual and all significant changes, in any, from the original 

restructuring plan have been properly recognized, classified and disclosed in accordance with 

EITF 94-3 and SAB 100. 

       36.    Davis tracked excess amounts in the restructuring reserves, which was referred to 

internally as cushion or available balances.  From Q4FY02 to Q2FY04, the Assistant 

Controller provided Davis with status updates at least once every quarter that tracked these 

improper accruals.  These documents identified amounts that were re-designated and, in some 

cases, identified how re-designated amounts were to be utilized for unrelated operating 

expenses.   

       37.    Dell failed to disclose that excess amounts were utilized for non-restructuring 

related activities.  Dells annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Commission on May 1, 2002 

and Dells quarterly reports on Forms 10-Q filed with the Commission on September 16, 2002 and 

December 16, 2002 also misrepresented restructuring reserve amounts as paid, when in fact a 

portion of them had been deemed as excess and re-designated to other accounts to be used for 

                                              14

unrelated items.  In his role as CAO, Davis signed Dells Form 10-Q filed with the Commission on 

December 16, 2002.   

       d.          Accounting Manipulations of Reserves at EMEA 

       38.    Dell improperly created and released reserves to offset certain restructuring actions 

in its Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) segment in FY03 and FY04 in contravention of 

GAAP.   

       39.    EMEA was an important part of Dells business and Dell highlighted EMEA as a 

significant component of its operations.  In FY03, EMEA generated 19.5% of Dells revenues and 

13.6% of the companys operating income.  In FY04, EMEA grew to 20.5% of Dells revenues 

and 18% of the companys operating income.  

       40.    During the period relevant to this complaint, Dell treated EMEA as a reportable 

segment.  In its Forms 10-K and Forms 10-Q, Dell therefore incorporated EMEAs operating 

income in the companys consolidated operating income and separately reported EMEAs 

operating income as a segment.  As Dell reported in its 2003 Form 10-K, it allocate[d] resources 

to and evaluate[d] the performance of its segments based on operating income. 

       41.    From Q3FY03 through Q1FY04, Dells EMEA segment improperly accrued $26 

million in reserves to offset the expenses to be incurred for a future regional restructuring.  Dell 

sought to avoid taking the expense in a single period, and instead spread it out over several periods. 

Building the reserve piecemeal caused Dell to understate EMEAs operating income from 

Q3FY03 through Q1FY04, and enabled the region to overstate operating income by $23.5 million 

in Q2FY04, when EMEA released most of the improper reserve.  In Q3FY04, Dell used the 

remainder of the improper reserve to avoid having to increase EMEAs accruals, and thereby 

overstated operating income by $2.5 million.  Throughout the period from Q3FY03 to Q3FY04, 

                                             15

        Case 1:10-cv-01464-RJL   Document 1    Filed 08/27/10   Page 16 of 34

the reserves held for restructuring in Dells EMEA segment were improperly classified in Dells 

books as reserves for factory invoices and other expenses completely unrelated to restructuring.   

       42.    The creation of the improper reserves began in Q3FY03 when EMEAs finance 

team first assessed a restructuring plan that included laying off managers and transferring certain 

operations to less expensive countries.  In September 2002, one of the two EMEA Finance 

Directors sought authorization from Dells CFO to record a reserve to pay for these anticipated 

restructuring expenses.  The CFO refused the request. 

       43.    On October 15, 2002, the CFO wrote the Finance Director, with copies to Davis 

and the Assistant Controller, that There will be no specially called out charge so how do we 

cover?? You guys need to get a plan in place ASAP that we can discuss and keep this confidential. . 

it gives us three quarters in essence to cover . . .  

       44.    On October 17, 2002, the EMEA Finance Director wrote the CFO back with a 

proposal for finding money to cover off these restructuring costs.  After asking for additional 

information, the CFO wrote do not know where you are on P/L this qtr but if we could 

overachieve all should be earmarked to this.  The CFO thereby directed his subordinate to 

earmark income earned in excess of financial targets to restructuring expenses rather than 

recording it as income in Dells general ledger.  

       45.    The EMEA Finance Director promptly followed the CFOs direction, even though 

it was inconsistent with GAAP.  Although EMEA had neither committed to a formal restructuring 

plan nor communicated any plan to employees, the region began accruing for EMEAs 

restructuring.  On or about November 6, 2002, the last day before its books closed for Q3FY03, 

EMEA accrued and maintained excess reserves totaling $13 million for its restructuring.  

                                              16

       46.    Dell reported EMEAs operating income as a segment in its Form 10-Q for the 

quarter ended November 1, 2002 as $104 million.  This amount did not reflect the $13 million that 

was reserved for EMEAs restructuring expenses 

       47.    In November 2002, the EMEA Finance Director informed the CFO and Davis of 

EMEAs misstatement, telling them that he had tucked away $13 million for EMEAs expected 

restructuring.  The Finance Director also advised the CFO that if Dell were short of its 

consolidated targets in the following quarter, it could take [the $13 million] to the bottom line and 

I will find it again in Q1. 

       48.    Early in Q4FY03, the EMEA Finance Director informed Davis and the Assistant 

Controller that he expected EMEA would be incurring $22.8 million in restructuring costs in 

future quarters.  EMEA subsequently increased its improper reserves by $9.8 million to $22.8 

million by failing to release accruals identified as excess in the quarter and to record a vendor 

credit in accordance with GAAP. 

       49.    In a slide presented in its February 13, 2003 earnings call and subsequently posted 

on its website, Dell disclosed that the EMEA segment had earned $134 million in Q4FY03.  This 

amount did not include the $9.8 million by which the restructuring reserve was increased in the 

quarter. 

       50.    Davis signed a management representation letter in February 2003 confirming to 

PWC that, among other things, (a) Dells FY2003 consolidated financial statements conformed 

with GAAP; (b) that [t]here are no material . . . accounts that have not been properly recorded in 

the accounting records underlying the consolidated financial statements; and (c) that [t]here are 

                                              17

no significant deficiencies . . . in the design or operation of internal controls which could adversely 

affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data.  These 

representations were false. 

       51.    After again exceeding its internal operating income projections, EMEA again 

improperly increased its reserves in Q1FY04.  A series of improper entries led to a net transfer of 

$3.2 million to the reserves, increasing their balances to $26 million.  After EMEAs books closed 

for the quarter, but a month before Dell filed its Form 10-Q, the EMEA Finance Director informed 

the CFO and Davis of the balance of EMEAs improper reserves.  Dell reported EMEAs 

operating income as $141 million in its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended May 2, 2003. 

       52.    In Q2FY04, EMEA incurred most of the restructuring expenses it had been 

expecting since Q3FY03.  A Finance Director in EMEA informed Davis that the expense for 

EMEAs de-layering and restructuring was about to hit.  The Finance Director wrote I know this 

is messy but it was always going to be when you try and hide $25M to off-set future restructuring 

costs and you are not allowed to call it re-structuring.  Through releases from the improper 

reserves, EMEA offset restructuring and other costs in the quarter, and overstated its operating 

income by $23.5 million in the quarter.  Dell reported the EMEA segments operating income as 

$145 million in its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended August 1, 2003. 

       e.           Dells Cookie Jar Reserves in its Bonus and Profit Sharing Accounts 

       53.    In addition to the above reserves, Dell manipulated its bonus and profit sharing 

reserve accounts in multiple quarters in FY02 and FY03 to manage its operating results. 

       54.    Throughout the relevant period, Dells Compensation Committee established a 

bonus and profit sharing target each year.  Dell accrued throughout each fiscal year for the 

anticipated bonus and profit sharing payout.  The bonus target was calculated using a grid based on 

                                              18 
---------------------Page 19---------------------

        Case 1:10-cv-01464-RJL   Document 1    Filed 08/27/10   Page 19 of 34

revenue growth and operating margin targets.  In March following the close of each fiscal year, the 

Compensation Committee met to determine whether the companys bonus payout would adhere to 

or depart from the amounts indicated on the bonus grid. 

       55.     Davis was aware by the beginning of FY02 that Dell was still carrying bonus 

over-accruals from FY00.  After conducting a thorough analysis of the over-accruals for Davis, a 

subordinate emailed Davis on February 6, 2001, while Dell was closing its FY01 books, asking 

Davis for approval to manage entries so that Dell could carry a $6M bonus over-accrual into FY02.  

The Assistant Controller emailed Davis that the proposed entries would have the effect of 

drawing down the $10M accrual from PYs [prior years] down to the $6M you see on [the] analysis.  

There is a possibility that we wont [pay as large a bonus as estimated,] which obviously would 

then add back to the cushion.  The $10M accrual the Assistant Controller referred to, which the 

analysis indicated was from FY00, was listed on a Q4FY01 Risks and Opportunities Schedule in a 

row labeled, Bonus/Prof Sh.- accruals from PYs [prior years].  The R&O Schedule showed 

Davis as the owner of the opportunity. 

       56.    In March 2001 (Q1FY02), Dells Compensation Committee decided on a 

bonus/profit sharing payout for FY01 that was less than the accrual the company had created to 

fund the payout.  Dell had over-accrued for the FY01 bonus/profit sharing payout before it filed its 

FY01 Form 10-K in May 2001.  Rather than releasing the entire excess reserve in Dells Q4FY01 

or Q1FY02 income statement in accordance with GAAP, however, Dell instead released only 

about $20 million of the over-accrual in Q1FY02, and then bled down the excess bonus reserves in 

Q2FY02 ($0.5 million), Q3FY02 ($10 million), Q4FY02 ($4.5 million), and Q1FY03 ($3.6 

million). 

                                             19

       57.    On May 4, 2001, a bonus analyst sent an email to Davis and the Assistant 

Controller regarding the over-accrual for the FY01 bonus/profit sharing payout:  Below is the 

result of the Bonus & Profit Sharing Clean Up effort: FY01 Overaccrual - Amer/Corp/[Product 

Group] has $25M to bleed, [Worldwide] = ~$32M. 

       58.      In an email exchange on August 14, 2001 about bonus scenarios with Dells CFO, 

Davis stated: I have assumed that the prior year over accrual will be fully bled out by the end of 

this year. (As discussed this morning, a lot of these bleeds have been built into the Corp Gen 

budget for Q2 - Q4.)  

       59.    In March 2002 (Q1FY03), Dells Compensation Committee decided on a 

bonus/profit sharing payout for FY02 that was again less than what the company had accrued.  

Before Dell filed its FY02 Form 10-K on May 1, 2002, Davis and the Assistant Controller knew 

that Dell was over-accrued for the FY02 payout.  On March 28, 2002, Davis received an estimate 

that the over-accrual would be about $30 million.   

       60.    Under GAAP, Dell should have released the bonus over-accrual no later than 

Q1FY03.  Dell, however, only released $6.1 million of the over-accrual in Q1FY03.  Dell bled 

down the balance of the excess bonus reserves in FY03 to smooth Dells reported operating 

expenses. 

       61.    In a note Davis drafted to himself on April 5, 2002  which was recovered from 

his draft email folder, and which had bonus status questions in the subject line  Davis wrote: 

              1.           What is the current status of the [bonus] accrual carryover? 
              2.          How does that compare with the Q1/Q2 forecast amounts for 
                      Corp Gen

                     Corp 
               
              (emphasis in original) 
                      
       62.    On May 2, 2002, the Assistant Controller stated in an email to Davis: Ive 

summarized below where we are regarding funding the FY03 Corp Gen shortfall.  My current 

sense is that well exit Q1 with $38M in restructuring accrual goodness . . . .  Together with 

bonus/profit sharing overaccruals, well be able to cover Corp Gen and still have ~$19M left to 

cover [other known matters], and other matters that may arise. 

       63.    On May 8, 2002, the Assistant Controller sent Davis a spreadsheet that showed 

restructuring reserve cushion and bonus over-accrual being used to cover the FY03 Corp General 

shortfall. That same day, Davis drafted the following reminder to himself: Note to [CFO] on the 

Bonus et al cushion. 

       64.    Instead of releasing the entire $18.6 million bonus over-accrual in Q4FY02 or 

Q1FY03, Dell bled down the over-accrual throughout the year, releasing $3.6 million from its 

FY01 bonus over-accrual and an additional $2.5 million from its FY02 bonus over-accrual in 

Q1FY03, $7.4 million in Q2FY03, and $5 million in Q3FY03.  As he had done the prior year, 

Davis periodically tracked the bleed down in the bonus and profit sharing reserves. 

       65.    Under GAAP, over-accruals relating to the FY01 bonus/profit sharing payout 

should have been released by the end of Q1FY02, and over-accruals relating to the FY02 

bonus/profit sharing payout should have been released by the end of Q1FY03, rather than retained 

and released gradually over time.  Contrary to GAAP, Dell bled its FY01 and FY02 over-accruals 

in multiple quarters in FY02 and FY03 to smooth operating expenses.

       f.           Dells Improper Failure to Increase Reserves for Las Cimas Liabilities 

       66.     Dell included a provision in the FY02 restructuring reserve to cover the costs of 

closing its Las Cimas facility in Texas.  On May 31, 2002, the Assistant Controller received an 

update presentation dated May 14, 2002 regarding the FY02 restructuring reserve, which included 

a statement that the Dell facilities group had expressed concerns over the adequacy of the facilities 

reserve.  On July 17, 2002, the Assistant Controller sent this presentation to Davis.  Under GAAP, 

Davis should have undertaken steps to quantify the additional reserves needed for Las Cimas at 

that time.  Davis failed to do so. 

       67.    On February 24, 2003 (Q1FY04), the Assistant Controller provided Davis with an 

analysis showing that the cost of exiting the Las Cimas facility would likely be $53 million more 

than Dell had reserved.  Under GAAP, Dell should have increased its Las Cimas reserves by 

approximately $33 million (the net present value of $53 million).   

       68.    Davis failed to take any steps to adjust Dells restructuring reserves to account for 

this new information.  It was not until October 2005 (Q3FY06) that Dell increased its reserves for 

closing the Las Cimas facility. 

                                    ENGAGEMENT LETTERS 

       69.    Davis, as Vice President, Corporate Planning & Reporting, signed Dells 

engagement letter, dated June 6, 2002, with Dells auditor, PWC, for the financial statements for 

FY03.  On behalf of Dell, Davis signed the agreement stating that:  The services and terms as set 

forth in this letter are agreed to. Among the terms in the letter were Managements 

responsibilities.  The terms in the Managements responsibilities to which Davis agreed on 

behalf of Dell included, among others: 

              The financial statements and information referred to above are the 
              responsibility of the management of the Company.  In this regard, 

                                               22

              management is responsible for properly recording transactions in 
              the accounting records and for establishing and maintaining internal 
              control sufficient to permit the preparation of financial statements 
              and information in conformity with generally accepted accounting 
              principles. Management is responsible for adjusting the financial 
              statements to correct material misstatements . . . . Management also 
              is responsible for identifying and ensuring that the Company 
              complies with the laws and regulations applicable to its activities. 

       70.    Davis, as Vice President, Worldwide Planning and Reporting, signed Dells 

engagement letter, dated September 4, 2003, with Dells auditor, PWC, for the financial 

statements for FY04.  Davis signed the letter, stating:  By signing below I acknowledge and agree 

to my obligation to ensure that the responsibilities of the Company and its management as set forth 

herein are properly discharged.  The terms in the Managements responsibilities to which Davis 

agreed on behalf of Dell were substantially the same as those in Dells June 6, 2002 engagement 

letter, quoted above.  The September 4, 2003 letter contained the following additional terms, 

which Davis acknowledged and to which he agreed:  

              Management also is responsible for the design and implementation 
              of programs and controls to prevent and detect fraud, and for 
              informing us [PWC] (i) about all known or suspected fraud affecting 
              the entity involving (a) management, (b) employees who have 
              significant roles in internal control, and (c) others where the fraud 
              could have a material effect on the financial statements; and (ii) of 
              its knowledge of any allegations of fraud or suspected fraud 
              affecting the entity received in communications from employees, 
              former employees, analysts, regulators, short sellers, or others. 

       71.    Davis, as Vice President, Corporate Finance/Chief Accounting Officer, signed 

Dells engagement letter, dated June 3, 2004, with Dells auditor, PWC, for the financial 

statements for FY05.  Davis signed the letter, stating:  By signing below I acknowledge and agree 

to my obligation to ensure that the responsibilities of the Company and its management as set forth 

herein are properly discharged.  The terms in the Managements responsibilities to which Davis 

agreed on behalf of Dell were substantially similar to those in Dells June 6, 2003 and September 4, 

                                               23

2003 engagement letters, quoted above.  In addition, the June 3, 2004 letter contained the 

following additional terms, which Davis acknowledged and to which he agreed: 

              Management is responsible for . . . notifying us of all deficiencies in 
              the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting 
              identified as part of managements assessment, including separately 
              disclosing to us all such deficiencies that it believes to be significant 
              deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control over 
              financial reporting.. . . Furthermore, management of the Company is 
              responsible for: 

              -      Accepting responsibility for the effectiveness of the 
                      Companys internal control over financial reporting. 

              -      Evaluating the effectiveness of the Companys internal 
                      control over financial reporting using suitable control 
                      criteria, 

              -      Supporting its evaluation with sufficient evidence, including 
                      documentation, and  

              -      Presenting a written assessment of the effectiveness of the 
                      Companys internal control over financial reporting as of the 
                      end of the Companys most recent fiscal year. 

                                  INTERNAL CONTROLS 
                                                 
       72.    As evidenced by the misconduct described above, at least for the periods FY02 

through FY05, Dell did not have a system of internal controls that was sufficient to assure 

compliance with GAAP.  Davis had direct responsibility for overseeing some or all aspects of 

Dells internal controls.  Davis also signed engagement letters with Dells auditors.  Based on his 

conduct described above, he knowingly circumvented those internal controls. 

                                  DELLS RESTATEMENT 

       73.    On or about August 17, 2006, Dell issued a press release, and filed a Form 8-K with 

the Commission, announcing that its audit committee had begun conducting an independent 

investigation into certain of Dells accounting and financial reporting practices. 

                                               24

        Case 1:10-cv-01464-RJL   Document 1    Filed 08/27/10   Page 25 of 34

       74.    On or about August 16, 2007, Dell filed with the Commission a Form 8-K 

announcing that the investigation had been completed, and the results reported to the audit 

committee.  In the August 16 Form 8-K, Dell announced that its audit committee had concluded 

that Dells previously issued financial statements for FY03, FY04, FY05, and FY06, including the 

interim periods within those years, and Q1FY07 (Restatement Period) should no longer be 

relied upon because of certain errors and irregularities in the financial statements.  

       75.    In the August 16 Form 8-K, Dell also announced that it would restate the previously 

issued financial statements for the Restatement Period.  Under GAAP, a restatement is required if 

there is a material error in the financial statements.  Dell stated that:  The accounting errors and 

irregularities that will be corrected are significant because of the combination of the number of 

issues identified, the qualitative nature of many of the issues, and in some cases, the dollar 

amounts involved. 

       76.    On or about October 30, 2007, Dell filed its Form 10-K with the Commission for 

the fiscal year ended February 2, 2007.  The 2007 Form 10-K contained the restated financial 

statements for the Restatement Period. 

       77.    The Form 10-K, in both the MD&A and notes to the financial statements, 

summarized the findings of the audit committee investigation (Summary of Investigation 

Findings).  Dell stated in its 2007 Form 10-K: 

              The investigation raised questions relating to numerous accounting 
              issues, most of which involved adjustments to various reserve and 
              accrued liability accounts, and identified evidence that certain 
              adjustments appear to have been motivated by the objective of 
              attaining financial targets.  According to the investigation, these 
              activities typically occurred in the days immediately following the 
              end of a quarter, when the accounting books were being closed and 
              the results of the quarter were being compiled.  The investigation 
              found evidence that, in that timeframe, account balances were 
              reviewed, sometimes at the request or with the knowledge of senior 

                                               25

        Case 1:10-cv-01464-RJL   Document 1    Filed 08/27/10   Page 26 of 34

              executives, with the goal of seeking adjustments so that quarterly 
              performance objectives could be met.  The investigation concluded 
              that a number of these adjustments were improper, including the 
              creation and release of accruals and reserves that appear to have 
              been made for the purpose of enhancing internal performance 
              measures or reported results, as well as the transfer of excess 
              accruals from one liability account to another and the use of the 
              excess balances to offset unrelated expenses in later periods. . . .  
              The investigation identified evidence that accounting adjustments 
              were viewed at times as an acceptable device to compensate for 
              earnings shortfalls that could not be closed through operational 
              means. 

       78.    Dells 2007 Form 10-K further stated in the Summary of Investigation Findings: 

[I]n a number of instances, purposefully incorrect or incomplete information about these 

activities was provided to internal or external auditors.  Dell also stated in the Summary that: 

The errors and irregularities identified in the course of the investigation revealed deficiencies in 

[Dells] accounting and financial control environment, some of which were determined to be 

material weaknesses, that require corrective and remedial actions. 

       79.    Dells Form 10-K described the Restatement Adjustments in the MD&A and 

more fully in the notes to the financial statements.  Dell reiterated that the financial statements for 

the Restatement Period should no longer be relied upon.  Among the Restatement Adjustments 

were Unsubstantiated Accruals and Inadequately Reconciled Accounts.  In its 2007 Form 10-K, 

Dell stated that 

              In some instances accrual and reserve accounts lacked justification 
              or supporting documentation.  In certain cases these accounts were 
              used to accumulate excess amounts from other reserve and accrual 
              accounts.  However, these excess reserves were not released to the 
              income statement in the appropriate reporting period or were 
              released for other purposes. . . . 

       80.    Dells 2007 Form 10-K, in Item 9A, contained Managements Report on Internal 

Control Over Financial Reporting.  The Report stated that internal control includes, among other 

things, those policies and procedures . . . which provide reasonable assurance that transactions are 

                                               26

        Case 1:10-cv-01464-RJL   Document 1    Filed 08/27/10   Page 27 of 34

recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP.  

As stated in the report:  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in 

internal control over financial reporting that there is more than a remote likelihood that a material 

misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. 

       81.    The Report concluded that there were material weaknesses in Dells internal 

control over financial reporting as of February 2, 2007.  With respect to the control environment, 

management concluded: 

              We did not maintain a tone and control consciousness that 
              consistently emphasized strict adherence to GAAP.  This control 
              deficiency resulted in an environment in which accounting 
              adjustments were viewed at times as an acceptable device to 
              compensate for operational shortfalls, which in certain instances led 
              to inappropriate accounting decisions and entries that appear to have 
              been largely motivated to achieve desired accounting results and, in 
              some instances, involved management override of controls.  In a 
              number of instances, information critical to an effective review of 
              transactions and accounting entries was not disclosed to internal and 
              external auditors. 

       82.    With respect to the period-end financial reporting process, management concluded 

that there was also a material weakness: 

              We did not maintain effective controls over period-end reporting 
              process, including controls with respect to the review, supervision, 
              and monitoring of accounting operations.  Specifically: . . . 

              We did not design and maintain effective controls to ensure the 
              completeness, accuracy, and timeliness of the recording of accrued 
              liabilities, reserves, and operating expenses . . . 

       83.    Management concluded that:  These material weaknesses resulted in the 

restatement of our annual and interim financial statements for Fiscal 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006 

and the first quarter of Fiscal 2007. . . . 

       84.    Dells Form 10-K contained the Report of Independent Registered Public 

Accounting Firm, dated October 29, 2007, by PWC, Dells independent auditors.  PWC audited 

                                               27

        Case 1:10-cv-01464-RJL   Document 1    Filed 08/27/10   Page 28 of 34

managements assessment of internal controls, included in Managements Report on Internal 

Control.  PWC rendered its opinion that managements assessment that the Company did not 

maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of February 2, 2007, is fairly stated, 

in all material respects. . . .  PWC also rendered its opinion that because of the effects of the 

material weaknesses . . . on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company 

has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of February 2, 2007. . . . 

                             INCENTIVE COMPENSATION 

       85.    During the relevant period, Dell had various compensation programs for its 

employees.  Under Dells Incentive Bonus Plan, in which Davis participated, there were numerous 

factors that determined whether a Dell employee would receive a bonus in a given year.  These 

factors included, but were not limited to, operating margin, revenue growth, customer experience, 

globalization, and individual performance reviews.  The accounting manipulations discussed 

above influenced Dells operating margin and inflated the calculations of Daviss bonuses in FY03 

and FY04 under the matrix. 

                           DELLS SECURITIES OFFERINGS 

       86.    Dell filed with the SEC registration statements on Forms S-8 on September 20, 

2001, October 4, 2002, and December 16, 2003.  The Forms S-8 filed in September 2001 and 

October 2002 were signed by Dells CEO and CFO.  The two Forms S-8 that Dell filed in 

December 2003 were signed by Dells CEO, CFO, and Davis.  The Forms S-8 mentioned above 

each specifically incorporated by reference the Form 10-K for the fiscal year preceding the Form 

S-8 and the Forms 10-Q for the fiscal year in which the Form S-8 was filed.  For example, the two 

Forms S-8 filed in December 2003 (Q4FY04) incorporated Dells FY03 Form 10-K and Dells 

Forms 10-Q for Q1FY04, Q2FY04, and Q3FY04.  The Forms S-8 also each incorporate all 

subsequently filed Forms 10-K and Forms 10-Q prior to the filing of a post-effective 

                                             28

amendment.  Except for one Form S-8 filed on September 20, 2001, none of the Forms S-8 

mentioned above were subject to the filing of a post-effective amendment during the period 

relevant to the allegations set forth above.  

       87.    Dell offered and sold securities continuously from FY02 through FY07 through 

various means.  Dell operated an Employee Stock Ownership Program, pursuant to which it 

offered and sold common stock to its employees.  Dell also offered and sold securities to the public 

through a Direct Stock Purchase Program (DSPP).  In addition, Dell granted options and 

restricted stock to its employees. 

                                        FIRST CLAIM 

                 Violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act 
                                [15 U.S.C. §77q(a)(2) and (3)] 
 

       88.    By reason of the conduct alleged in paragraphs 1 through 87 above, which are 

realleged and incorporated by reference as if set forth fully herein, Davis, in the offer or sale of 

securities, by the use of the means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate 

commerce or by use of the mails, directly or indirectly, (a) obtained money or property by means 

of untrue statements of material fact or omissions to state material facts necessary in order to make 

the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; 

and (b) engaged in transactions, practices or courses of business which operated or would operate
