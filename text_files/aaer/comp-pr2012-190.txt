            Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission alleges: 

                                              INTRODUCTION 
         
            1.      This case concerns fraud and other misconduct by Gilbert            Fiorentino, a former 

    director of Systemax Inc. (Systemax or the Company) and the former chief executive of its               

    Technology Products Group.   

            2.      Systemax is a Fortune 1000 company that sells personal computers and other 

    consumer electronics through its websites, retail stores, and direct mail catalogs.  In its 2010   annual 

    report (Form 10-K), Systemax reported sales revenue of approximately $3.6 billion for fiscal year 

    2010.   The Technology Products Group generated more than 90% of Systemaxs  2010 revenue 

    through retail operations marketed under several brand names, including Tiger Direct, CompUSA, 

    and Circuit City. 

            3.      Over the five year period spanning from       2006 through 2010, Fiorentino received 

    more than $400,000 from one or more entities that conducted business with Systemax             , which he 

    failed to disclose to Systemax and its auditors.  Fiorentino also misappropriated merchandise from 
---------------------Page 2---------------------

Case 1:12-cv-23388-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/17/2012   Page 2 of 13

   Systemax, estimated to be worth at least several hundred thousands of dollars, which he also failed 

   to disclose to Systemax and its auditors.  As a result of Fiorentinos actions, Systemax materially 

   understated his compensation and failed to disclose his personal financial interest in certain related 

   party transactions in its proxy statements, which were incorporated by reference in Systemaxs 

   Forms 10-K.  Fiorentino reviewed and signed each Systemax Form 10- K from fiscal year 2006 

   through 2010, knowing the Forms 10-K failed to make the required disclosures. 

          4.      Through his conduct, Fiorentino violated Sections 10(b), 13(b)(5), and 14(a) of the 

   Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rules 10b-    5, 13b2-1, 13b2-

   2, 14a-3, and 14a-9.  In addition, Fiorentino  aided and abetted Systemaxs violations of Sections 

   13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1. 

                                   JURISDICTION AND VENUE 

          5.      This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(d), 21(e), and 27 

   of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa.  Fiorentino has, directly or indirectly, 

   made use  of the means or instrum  entalities  of interstate commerce  in connection with the 

   transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged herein. 

          6.      Venue is proper in this Court because Fiorentino resides in Miami and the acts, 

   practices, transactions, and courses of business alleged herein occurred within the Southern District 

   of Florida. 

                                         THE DEFENDANT 

          7.      Fiorentino, age 51, is a resident of Miami, Florida.  He served as the chief executive 

   of Systemaxs Technology Products Group, based in Miami, Florida.  He also served as a director 

   of Systemax from 2004  until his resignation on May 6, 2011.

                                               FACTS 

   Fiorentino Received Additional Compensation and Other Personal Benefits  

          8.      As the chief executive of Systemaxs Technology Products Group, Fiorentino dealt 

   directly with external service providers  ,  manufacturer representatives  and other entities that 

   conducted business with Systemax .  Many of these external service providers, manufacture      r 

   representatives and other entities   participated in  one or more  transactions with Systemax that 

   exceeded $120,000 annually. 

          9.      From 2006 through 2010, Fiorentino received   more than $400,000 in undisclosed 

   compensation from one or more external service providers, manufacturer representatives and other 

   entities that conducted business with Systemax.  For example, Fiorentino            shared  one 

   representatives monthly commissions generated from sales to Systemaxs subsidiary, Tiger Direct.  

   This payment stream ended after the representative agreed to renovate the executive kitchen in the 

   Tiger Direct office headquarters, which cost him more than $30,000. 

          10.    Fiorentino also demanded and received from $5,000    to $10,000 monthly from an 

   entity that supplied materials to Systemaxs subsidiaries for use in retail and mail order operations.  

   He received these payments from at least January 2006 through at least December 2010. 

          11.    Additionally, as a result of his executive position at Systemax, Fiorentino had access 

   to Company merchandise used to market Systemax products  in mail order catalogs and  online.  

   Between 2006 and 2010, Fiorentino    routinely misappropriated this merchandise, estimated to be 

   worth at least several hundred thousands of dollars,  and failed to disclose it  to Systemax and its 

   auditors.   

                                                  3 
    
---------------------Page 4---------------------

Case 1:12-cv-23388-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/17/2012   Page 4 of 13

          12.    As a result of Fiorentinos receipt of undisclosed compensation from individuals and 

   entities that conducted business with Systemax, and his misappropriation of corporate merchandise, 

   Systemax materially understated Fiorentinos executive compensation. 

   Fiorentino Failed to Disclose the Compensation and Personal Benefits to Systemax and its Auditors 

          13.    As part of its compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes -Oxley Act of 2002, 15 

   U.S.C. § 7262, Systemax required certain management personnel, including Fiorentino, to sign 

   annual conflict of interest questionnaires, certifications of compliance with the C    ompanys 

   corporate ethics policy, and representations about   transactions out of the course of ordinary 

   business.  Fiorentino signed each of these documents for the fiscal years 2007 through 2010.   

          14.    In completing the conflict of interest questionnaires, Fiorentino falsely represented 

   he did not  [r]eceive or make any arrangements for the receipt of any compensation or other 

   personal financial benefit from a   current or potential supplier, competitor or customer of the 

   Company. 

          15.    By signing the certifications of compliance with the Companys corporate ethics 

   policy, he falsely represented he had not used [c]ompany property, information, or [his] position 

   for personal gain and had compl[ied] with internal controls and procedures of the Company 

   that are intended to allow for better management and protection of the Companys assets. 

          16.    Additionally, Fiorentino routinely signed management representation letters to  the 

   Companys independent auditors from at least June 2006 until at least May 13, 2010 that stated: 

   We have no knowledge of any fraud or suspected fraud involving management or other employees 

   who have a significant role in the Companys internal control over financial reporting. 

          17.    On March 17, 2011, Fiorentino signed a management representation letter to the 

   Companys independent auditors that contained the language quoted above, but added except for 

                                                  4  
    
---------------------Page 5---------------------

Case 1:12-cv-23388-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/17/2012   Page 5 of 13

   certain matters which are the subject of whistleblow er allegations concerning individuals at our 

   Miami Florida [sic] operations which are the subject of an independent Audit Committee 

   investigation.  This additional disclosure related directly to Fiorentinos conduct over the previous 

   several years, which he had failed to disclose to the Company and its auditors for more than five 

   years. 

           18.    Furthermore, all of the management representation letters Fiorentino signed, like the 

   Companys internal conflict of interest questionnaires, contained a statement that no officer of the 

   Company had a business interest in conflict with the Company and that such an interest would be 

   contrary to Company policy.  

   Fiorentino  Knowingly  Misrepresented His Compensation and Omitted           Disclosure of the   
   Compensation Arrangements in Proxy Statements and Forms 10-K              
    
           19.    Because Fiorentino was one of Systemax    s highest compensated  executives,  the 

   securities laws required Systemax to disclose all compensation he received each fiscal year.  

   Perquisites and other personal benefits, or property, unless the aggregate amount of such 

   compensation is less than $10,000, must be disclosed pursuant to Item 402(c) of Regulation S-K, 17 

   C.F.R. § 229.402(c)(2)(ix). 

           20.    In addition, Item 404(a) of Regulation S  -K, 17 C.F.R. § 229.404(a),   requires a 

   description of any transaction or series of similar transactions exceeding $120,000 (adjusted upward 

   from $60,000 as of December 15, 2006) in which the issuer is a party and in which any director, 

   executive officer, or any member of their   immediate families has a direct or indirect material 

   interest.  The Companys Form 10-K and proxy statement must provide this disclosure. 

           21.    Fiorentino received personal benefits and compensation in excess of $10,000 from 

   entities that engaged in transactions with Systemax that exceeded $120,000 each year from 2006 

                                                   5

Case 1:12-cv-23388-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/17/2012   Page 6 of 13

   through 2010.  However, he did not  disclose this additional compensation or his interest in those 

   transactions to Systemax or its independent auditors. 

           22.    As a result, Systemax did not disclose this information in its proxy statements or 

   Forms 10-K for the years 2006 through 2010.   

           23.    Fiorentino, as a director of Systemax, reviewed and signed the Companys Form 10-

   K for each of the fiscal  years 2006  through 2010 even though he knew the incorporated proxy  

   statements materially understated his compensation and failed to disclose his financial interest in 

   certain related party transactions. 

   The Audit Committee Investigation Led to Fiorentinos Resignation 

           24.    In January 2011, Systemax received an internal whistleblower complaint about 

   Fiorentinos actions at the Miami, Florida office.  The Companys Audit Committee launched an 

   internal investigation. 

           25.    The Company disclosed the    internal investigation in its Form 10-K  , filed with the 

   Commission on March 17, 2011.  Specifically, the Company stated:   our Audit Committee, with 

   the assistance of independent counsel, is conducting an independent investigation into certain 

   anonymous whistleblower allegations concerning our Miami, Florida operations.  While the 

   investigation is not yet complete, it does not appear that there is any material impact on our reported 

   consolidated financial statements.   

           26.    Upon completion of the internal investigation,  Systemax announced via a press 

   release and Form 8-K, filed with the Commission on April 17, 2011, that it had placed Fiorentino on 

   administrative leave and notified him of its intent to terminate him.   The press release also stated 

   that Fiorentinos actions   did not have a material impact on Systemaxs previously reported 

   financial results and were limited to the Companys Miami operations. 

                                                   6

          27.    Soon thereafter, Fiorentino agreed to resign   from all of  his positions with the 

   Company, surrender stock and stock options that the Company ha  s valued at as much as     $9.1 

   million, and repay his 2010 annual bonus of $480,000.

          30.    By reason of the foregoing, Fiorentino directly or indirectly violated and, unless 

   enjoined, is reasonably likely to continue to violate, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 

   78j(b), and Rule 10b-5(b), 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5(b).

          32.    Fiorentino knowingly falsified Systemaxs books and records required to be kept 

    under Section 13 of the Exchange Act and knowingly circumvented Systemaxs system of internal 

    accounting controls. 

          33.    By reason of the foregoing, Fiorentino violated, and  unless enjoined, is reasonably 

    likely to continue to violate, Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78m(b)(5) , and

   if fully set forth herein. 

          35.    Fiorentino violated Rule 13b2-2 of the Exchange Act by, directly or indirectly: 

                  a)     Making or causing to be made a materially false or misleading statement to 

                         an accountant in connection with; or 

                  b)     Omitting to state, or causing another person to omit to state, any material fact 

                         necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances 

                         under which such statements were made, not misleading, to an accountant in

           38.    Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act requires registrants that solicit any proxy or 

   consent or authorization in connection with any security registered pursuant to Section 12 of the 

   Exchange Act (other than an exempted security), to comply with such rules as the Commission may 

   promulgate.  Rule 14a -3 provides that no solicitation of a proxy may occur unless each person 

   solicited is concurrently furnished or has previously been furnished with a proxy statement 

   containing the information specified in Schedule 14A.  Rule 14a -9 prohibits, among other things, 

   the use of proxy statements which omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the 

   statements therein not false or misleading. 

           39.    Systemaxs proxy statements for the years 2006   to  2010 materially understated 

   Fiorentinos compensation and omitted disclosure of the related party transactions described in this 

   Complaint.  Fiorentino reviewed the proxy statements and knew them to be false and mis leading, 

   yet allowed the statements to be filed. 

           40.    By reason of the foregoing, Fiorentino violated, and unless enjoined, is reasonably 

   likely to continue to violate Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78n(a), and Rules 14a-3 

   and 14a-9, 17 C.F.R. §§ 240.14a-3, 240.14a-9.

                     Aiding and Abetting Systemaxs Violations of Section 13(a)  
                           of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1

           41.    The Commission repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 27 of this Complaint as 

    if fully set forth herein. 

           42.    Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act requires every    issuer of securities registered 

    pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act to file with the Commission, in accordance with such 

    rules and regulation as the Commission has prescribed, information and documents required by the 

    Commission to keep reasonably current the information and documents required to be included in 

    or filed with annual reports as the Commission has prescribed.  Exchange Act Rule 13a-1 requires 

    such issuers to file annual reports on Form 10- K and Exchange Act Rule 12b-20 requires that, in 

    addition to including the i nformation expressly required in the annual report, issuers add such 

    further material information necessary to make the required statements, in the light of the 

    circumstances under with they are made not misleading. 

           43.    Based on the conduct alleged herein, Systemax violated Section 13(a) of the 

    Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C.  § 78m(a), and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder, 17 C.F.R. §§ 240.12b-

    20, 240.13a-1, by failing to accurately disclose Fiorentinos additional compensation and business 

    arrangements as  required under Items 402(c) and 404(a) of Regulation S      -K, 17 C.F.R. §§ 

    229.402(c)(2)(ix), 229.404(a).  

           44.    Fiorentino, in the manner described above, knowingly provided substantial 

    assistance to Systemax in its failure to comply disclosure with Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act 

    and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder.

    13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder.

                             Aiding and Abetting Systemaxs Violations of  
                       Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act  
                         (Books and Records and Internal Control Violations)    
                                                     
           46.    The Commission repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 27 of this Complaint as 

    if fully set forth herein. 

           47.    Based on the conduct alleged herein, Systemax violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the 

    Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78m(b)(2)(A),    by keeping books and records with fraudulent entries 

    and/or omissions related to officer compensation and related party transactions.  Systemax violated 

    Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78m(b)(2)(B),  by maintaining a system of 

    internal controls that permitted Fiorentino to obtain a significant amount of unreported 

    compensation and to conceal his related party transactions. 

           48.    Fiorentino, as described in this Complaint, knowingly provided substantial 

    assistance to Systemax in connection with its failure to make and keep books and records, and 

    accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflected Systemaxs transactions. 

           49.    Fiorentino, as described in this Complaint, knowingly provided substantial 

    assistance to Systemax in connection with its failure to devise and maintain a system of internal 

    accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as 

    necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conf ormity with generally accepted 

    accounting principles.
