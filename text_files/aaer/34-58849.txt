                                               II. 

       In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the 
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings 
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these 
proceedings, and the findings contained in Section III.3. below, which are admitted, Respondent 
consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Rule 102(e) 
of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions 
(“Order”), as set forth below.   

                                              III. 

       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that:  

              1.      Schechter, age 54, is a resident of La Jolla, California.  In 1990, Schechter 
founded the company that eventually became Island Pacific, Inc.  Schechter was CEO of Island 
Pacific from its inception to January 2001, October 2001 to June 2003, and April 2005 to June 
2008.  He was Chairman of the Board of Directors of Island Pacific from February 1994 to July 
2003.  From approximately August 2003 through January 2005, Schechter was designated as a 
consultant to Island Pacific. During this period, Schechter was a controlling person of Island 
Pacific and controlled a substantial number of its shares.  Schechter was a Chartered Accountant in 
South Africa from 1979 to 1989, when he emigrated to the United States and allowed his license to 
lapse.  On June 4, 2008, Island Pacific announced that Schechter had resigned from his CEO and 
director positions effective that day but that Schechter would continue to handle special projects on 
a part-time basis.  

              2.      Retail Pro, Inc. (formerly known as Island Pacific, Inc.) was, at all relevant 
times, a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Southern California.  Island 
Pacific was engaged in the business of developing and selling computer software to the retail 
industry. Its common stock is registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the 
Exchange Act, traded on the American Stock Exchange until it was delisted on October 25, 2005, 
for failing to file periodic reports, and currently trades through Pink OTC Markets, Inc. 
(RTPR.PK). On December 21, 2007, Island Pacific sold its Island Pacific division to an Australian 
company and renamed the unsold portion of the company Retail Pro, Inc. 

              3.      On October 16, 2008, a final judgment was entered against Schechter, 
permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, 
and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), and 
Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting any violation of Section 

the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or of the rules and regulations 
thereunder. 
                                               2

13(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder, in the civil action 
entitled Securities and Exchange Commission v. Retail Pro, Inc. 
(fka Island Pacific, Inc.) et. al, Civil Action Number 08 CV 1620 WQH (RBB), in the United 
States District Court for the Southern District of California.  Schechter was also ordered to pay 
$488,410 in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains from his sales of stock while participating in the 
unlawful conduct, and $27,437 in prejudgment interest, and a $120,000 civil money penalty. 

              4.      The Commission’s Complaint alleged, among other things, that Schechter 
participated in Island Pacific’s financial fraud from the quarter ended September 30, 2003, 
through the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, in which Island Pacific recognized $3.9 million 
from a non-monetary transaction with QQQ Systems Pty Limited (“QQQ”) in violation of 
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles; overstated its quarterly revenues by 140% and 
reported a small profit instead of a $3.1 million loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2003; 
overstated its annual revenues by 22% and understated its losses by 47% for the fiscal year 
ended March 31, 2004; and failed to disclose the non-monetary nature of the transaction with 
QQQ in its periodic reports, earnings press releases, and its earnings conference call with 
analysts and shareholders.  The Complaint alleged that Schechter participated in the financial 
fraud by, among other things, negotiating the non-monetary transaction with QQQ, approving 
the improper recognition of revenue, reviewing and approving Island Pacific’s earnings press 
release and scripts for the conference calls, and providing false information to Island Pacific’s 
auditor in connection with the audit of Island Pacific’s fiscal year 2004 audit.  The Complaint 
further alleged that Schechter profited from the financial fraud by selling through a trust he 
controlled 637,750 shares of Island Pacific stock. 

                                              IV. 

       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
impose the sanction agreed to in Respondent Schechter’s Offer.      

       Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that: 

       Schechter is suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an 
accountant.   

 By       the Commission.
