ORDER DENYING PETITION TO LIFT TEMPORARY 
SUSPENSION AND DIRECTING HEARING ON THE PETITION 
 
                                               I. 

       Brian D. Fox has petitioned us to lift an order issued pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3) of our 
Rules of Practice temporarily suspending him from appearing or practicing before the 
Commission.  Fox failed to file his Petition with the Secretary as our Rules of Practice require 
and the Office of the Secretary only received it after the time period specified by our Rules to 
challenge the Order had expired.  As discussed below, we have determined to waive the 
requirements of Rules 102(e)(3)(ii) and 151(b), and to treat the Petition as timely filed as of May 
31, 2013.  We also deny the Petition to lift the suspension and direct that the matter be scheduled 
for a hearing before an administrative law judge. 

                                               II. 

       On November 2, 2012, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma 
entered judgment against Fox, permanently enjoining him from future violations, direct or 
indirect, of certain provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and specified rules 
           1                                         2
thereunder.    The Judgment, which Fox has appealed,   further prohibited him  from acting as an

Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder).

officer or director of any issuer that has a class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of 

the Exchange Act or is required to file reports pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act.  

As its basis, the Judgment states that Fox had previously consented to permanent injunctive relief 

and an officer-and-director bar and that the Court had found his consent valid and enforceable.   

         On January 29, 2013, we entered an Order Instituting Public Administrative Proceedings 

and Imposing Temporary Suspension Pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3) of the Commission's Rules of 
           3
Practice.      In the Order,   we  found that    Fox had misled the investing public by fraudulently 

inflating  the revenue and assets and fraudule           ntly omitting major liabilities        of Powder River 

Petroleum International, Inc. in its Commission filings, and by making other false and 

misleading public disclosures.  We also found that               a court of competent jurisdiction h          ad 

permanently enjoined Fox from violating the Federal securities laws within the meaning of Rule 

102(e)(3)(i)(A) and, in view of this finding, deemed it appropriate and in the public interest that 

Fox be temporarily suspended from appearing or practicing                    before the Commission.  The Order 

further provided that      Fox could file a petition with the Commission to lift the temporary 

suspension     within   thirty   days after service of the Order       , and that, if he failed to do so, the 

suspension would become permanent               . 

         Fo x subsequently prepared a          petition   seeking the removal of        the temporary suspension          or, 
                                                                     4
in the alternative, seeking a hearing with respect to             it .    On or before February 28, 2013, the 

Commission's Fort Worth Regional Office received a                   service   copy of    the  Pe tition  .   An 

attachment to t    he Petition   state s that  , in addition to the copy sent to the Fort Worth Regional 

Office,   Fox also   planned to deliver       a copy to   our  Headquarters at      its  general address    , with no 

indication it was otherwise directed to the Secretary               as required under our rules       .   The Office of 

Secretary did not receive that copy.           Instead,   the Office    first received   actual notice and      a copy of 

Fox's Petition    from Fort Worth on         May 31, 2012     , following     a  routine  inquiry from staff in      Fort 

Worth  .    

                                                            III. 

         Rule 102(e)(3)(ii) of our Rules of Practice provides that any person challenging a 

temporary suspension from appearing and practicing before the Commission must do so within 

thirty days after service of the order by "petition[ing] the Commission to lift the temporary 
                5
suspension."        Under Rule 151(b) of the Rules of Practice, "[f]iling of papers with the 
                                                                                6
Commission shall be made by filing them with the Secretary."                        In turn, Rule 151(d) requires that 

"[p]apers filed with the Commission" by mail "shall be acc                  ompanied by a certificate stating,"

                                                                                                 7
among other things, "the mailing address . . . to which service was made . . . ."                    In  an attachment 

to  his Petition, Fox  indicated    that  he planned to    deliver   the  Petition to the  Commission       at  the 

Headquarters     general ad   dress   without reference to the Secretary       .   As noted above, the first    notice 

and  copy of the Petition that t    he Office of the Secretary       received was the one forwarded by the 

Fort Worth Regional Office on          May 31, 2013.  Because Fox did not            file his Petition  w ith  the 

Office of Secretary     within   thirty   days of service of the Order      he challenges    – indeed, has never 

properly directed his Petition to the Secretary – we could treat his Petition as never properly filed 

in a timely manner under our Rules of Practice. 

         Nonetheless, under the circumstances, we deem it appropriate to waive compliance with 

Rules 102(e)(3)(ii) and 151(b) to the extent necessary to allow consideration of the Petition.  

Under Rule 100(c), we may "by order direct, in a particular proceeding, that an alternative 

procedure shall apply or that compliance with an otherwise applicable rule is unnecessary" based 

upon our determination "that to do so would serve the interests of justice and not result in 
                                                    8
prejudice to the parties to the proceeding."            U nder the circumstances,      including the fact that Fox 

is acting  pro se and appears to have made an effort, albeit flawed, to file a copy of the Petition, 

we find that it would serve the interests of justice and would not prejudice Fox or the Division of 

Enforcement to waive compliance with Rules 102(e)(3)(ii) and 151(b) to the extent necessary to 

treat Fox's Petition as timely filed on May 31, 2013, when the Office of the Secretary received it.   

         We thus address Fox's request that we remove his temporary suspension.  Rule 

102(e)(3)(i)(a) permits the Commission to suspend any accountant or other professional or expert 

who has been "[p]ermanently enjoined . . . from violating or aiding and abetting the violation of 
                                                                                                           9
any provision of the Federal securities laws or of the rules and regulations thereunder."                      At this 

stage  , it appears that the findings made in the injunctive proceeding and the injunction issued 

against Fox "justify the continuance of his          suspension until it can be determined what, if any, 
                                                                                  10
action may be appropriate to protect the Commission's processes."                      As provided in Rule 
                 11
102(e)(3)(iii),     therefore, we will set the matter down for public hearing.               We express no opinion 
                                            12
as to the merits   of  Fox 's arguments    .   

         Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED              that Fox's Petition be treated as, and is, timely filed as of 

May 31, 2013     ; it is further 

         ORDERED        that this proceeding be set down for public hearing before an administrative 

law judge in accordance with Rule          of Practice 110.  As specified in Rule of Practice

contemplated by the operative Rule   of Practice, 102(e)(3), and, in any event, we did not consider it in reaching this 
decision.
