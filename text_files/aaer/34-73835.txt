                                           Summary 
 
       1.     This matter concerns violations of the books and records and internal controls 
provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) by Bruker.  The violations took place 
from at least 2005 through 2011 and occurred throughout Bruker’s China operations.  Employees 
of the China offices of four Bruker subsidiaries (collectively, the “Bruker China Offices”) made 
unlawful payments of approximately $230,938 to government officials (“Chinese government 
officials”) who were employed by state owned entities (“SOEs”) in China that were Bruker 
customers.  These payments were made to obtain or retain business from the SOEs for the Bruker 
China Offices.  Specifically, all of the Bruker China Offices provided non-business related travel to 
Chinese government officials, and one Bruker China Office also paid Chinese government officials 
under “research cooperation” ventures and “collaboration” agreements (collectively, the 
“Collaboration Agreements”) for which there was no legitimate business purpose.  Bruker realized 
approximately $1.7 million in profits from sales contracts with SOEs whose officials received the 
improper payments.    
        
       2.     The payments to the Chinese government officials were recorded as legitimate 
business and marketing expenses in the Bruker China Offices’ books and records, when in fact 
they were improper payments designed to personally benefit the officials.  The Bruker China 
Offices’ books and records were consolidated into Bruker’s books and records, thereby causing 
Bruker’s books and records to be inaccurate.  Bruker failed to devise and maintain an adequate 
system of internal accounting controls sufficient to prevent and detect the improper payments that 
occurred over several years. 
        
                                          Respondent 
                                                     
       3.     Bruker Corporation is a Delaware corporation with its headquarters in Billerica, 
Massachusetts.  Bruker designs, manufactures, and markets analytical tools and life science and 
materials research systems (e.g., infrared spectrometers and microscopes) and maintains operations 
in North America, Europe, and China.  Bruker manages its China operations through the Shanghai 
and Beijing representative offices of the Asia-based subsidiaries of four Bruker divisions: Bruker 
Optics, Bruker BioSpin, Bruker Daltonics, and Bruker Materials (formerly Bruker AXS).  Bruker’s 
common stock is registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act 
and is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (ticker: BRKR). 
 
                                             Facts 
        
       A.     The Bruker China Offices Improperly Funded  
              Leisure Travel for Chinese Government Officials 
        
       4.     The Bruker China Offices funded leisure travel for Chinese government officials to 
visit the United States, the Czech Republic, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, Switzerland and 
Italy.  These leisure trips typically followed business-related travel funded by the Bruker China 
Offices.  The Chinese government officials who went on the trips often authorized the purchase of 

                                                2  
---------------------Page 3---------------------

 
products from the Bruker China Offices.  For example, during 2006, as part of a sales contract with 
an SOE, a Bruker China Office paid for purported training expenses for a Chinese government 
official (who signed the sales contract on behalf of the SOE).  In fact, the payment included 
reimbursement for sightseeing, tour tickets, shopping and other leisure activities in Frankfurt and 
Paris.  Also, in 2007, a Bruker China Office paid for three Chinese government officials to visit 
Sweden for a conference, but included as part of the travel, several days of sightseeing in Sweden, 
Finland, and Norway. 
          
       5.      The Bruker China Offices also funded certain trips for Chinese government 
officials that had no legitimate business component.  For example, during 2009, a Bruker China 
Office paid for two Chinese government officials to travel to New York, despite the lack of any 
Bruker facilities there, and to Los Angeles, where they engaged in sightseeing activities.  Also 
during 2009, a Bruker China Office paid for three Chinese government officials to visit 
destinations in Europe for sightseeing.  In another instance, during 2010, a Bruker China Office 
paid for three Chinese government officials to visit Frankfurt, Heidelberg, Stuttgart, and Munich, 
in Germany, as well as Salzburg, Liz, Innsbruck, Graz, and Vienna, in Austria.  And in 2011, a 
Bruker China Office paid for Chinese government officials from seven SOEs to go on sightseeing 
visits to Europe, including Austria, France, Switzerland, Italy, and the Czech Republic.  In certain 
cases, the Chinese government officials who went on these trips were involved in purchasing 
products from the Bruker China Offices.   
        
       6.      Overall, from 2005 through 2011, the Bruker China Offices paid approximately 
$119,710 to fund 17 trips for Chinese government officials that were for the most part not related 
to any legitimate business purpose.  These trips were recorded in Bruker’s books and records as 
business expenses, without any indication that they were primarily for sightseeing and other non-
business related activities.  Bruker improperly profited by $1,131,740 from contracts obtained from 
the SOEs whose officials participated on these trips. 
        
       B.     A Bruker China Office Improperly Funneled Payments to Officials of  
               SOEs Under the Guise of Collaboration and Research Agreements  
        
       7.      From 2008 through 2011, a Bruker China Office paid $111,228 to Chinese 
government officials pursuant to 12 suspect Collaboration Agreements.  Generally, under these 
Collaboration Agreements, the SOEs had to provide research on Bruker products, or had to use 
Bruker products in demonstration laboratories.  However, the Collaboration Agreements did not 
specify the work product that the SOEs had to provide to be paid, and no work product was in fact 
provided to the Bruker China Office by the SOEs.  Also, certain Collaboration Agreements were 
executed directly with a Chinese government official, rather than the SOE itself; in some cases, the 
Bruker China Office paid the Chinese government official directly.  And at times, the Chinese 
government officials who signed the Collaboration Agreements or obtained payments under the 
Agreements were involved in purchasing products from the Bruker China Office.  Bruker profited 
by approximately $583,112 from contracts improperly obtained from the SOEs whose officials 
received payments under the Collaboration Agreements.

       C.     Bruker Failed to Implement an Adequate Internal Controls System 
                
       8.      From at least 2005 through 2011, Bruker failed to implement an adequate internal 
controls system to address the potential FCPA problems posed by its ownership of the Bruker 
China Offices, which sold their products primarily to SOEs.  For example, Bruker did not translate 
its training presentations on FCPA, ethics, or compliance issues into local languages, including 
Mandarin.  And although Bruker implemented an FCPA policy in 2006, it failed to translate that 
policy into Mandarin and relied mainly on its China-based managers to ensure that employees 
understood the potential FCPA implications of doing business with SOEs.  Also, while Bruker 
periodically distributed its Code of Conduct (containing its gifts and entertainment policies) and 
employee handbook to employees worldwide, it again failed to translate these documents into local 
languages, including Chinese.  Likewise, Bruker’s toll free employee hotline, which employees 
were to use to report complaints anonymously, was not provided in Mandarin, limiting its efficacy.   
        
       9.      Bruker also failed to adequately monitor and supervise the senior executives at the 
Bruker China Offices to ensure that they enforced anti-corruption policies or kept accurate records 
concerning payments to Chinese government officials.  The Bruker China Offices had no 
independent compliance staff or an internal audit function that had authority to intervene into 
management decisions and, if appropriate, take remedial actions.  Bruker also failed to tailor its 
preapproval processes for conditions in China, instead allowing the Bruker China Offices approval 
over items such as nonemployee travel and changes to contracts.  As a result, senior employees of 
the Bruker China Offices had unsupervised control over the compliance process; these employees 
in turn abused their privileges, approving suspect payments to Chinese government officials for 
non-business related travel and for purported Collaboration Agreements. 
        
       D.     Discovery, Internal Investigation, and Self-Reporting 
        
       10.    Bruker discovered the improper payments to Chinese government officials during 
2011 while investigating the misappropriation of company funds by certain employees of a Bruker 
China Office.  Upon learning about these payments, Bruker’s board of directors promptly initiated 
an investigation, with the assistance of independent outside counsel and an independent forensic 
consulting firm.  Bruker self-reported the preliminary results of its internal investigation to both the 
staff of the Commission and to the Department of Justice.  Thereafter, Bruker, on its own initiative, 
undertook a broad review of the China operations of its other divisions.  To the extent this internal 
review identified additional issues of concern, Bruker fully shared its findings with the staff. 
        
       11.    As part of its internal review and investigation, Bruker promptly undertook 
significant remedial measures including terminating the senior staff at each of the Bruker China 
Offices.  Bruker also revised its pre-existing compliance program, updated and enhanced its 
financial accounting controls and its compliance protocols and policies, and implemented those 
enhancements in China, and thereafter around the world.  These steps included:  (1) instituting pre-
approval processes for nonemployee travel and significant changes to contracts; (2) establishing a 
new internal audit function and hiring a new director of internal audit who is charged with 
oversight over Bruker’s global compliance program, including FCPA compliance;  (3) adopting an 

                                                4  
---------------------Page 5---------------------

 
amended FCPA policy translated into local languages;  (4)  implementing an enhanced FCPA 
training program, which includes training programs in local languages as well as mandatory online 
employee training programs regarding ethics and FCPA compliance;  (5) enhancing due diligence 
procedures for third-parties;  and (6)  implementing a new global whistleblower hotline.   
        
       12.    Throughout the process, Bruker provided extensive, thorough, and real-time 
cooperation with the Commission.  In addition to self-reporting to the Commission shortly after 
discovering the FCPA violations, Bruker voluntarily provided the Commission with real-time 
reports of its investigative findings; shared its analysis of important documents and summaries of 
witness interviews; expanded the scope of the investigation at the Commission’s request; and 
responded to the Commission’s requests for documents and information in a timely manner.  These 
actions assisted the Commission in efficiently collecting valuable evidence, including information 
that may not have been otherwise available to the staff.  
 
                                Legal Standards and Violations 
                
       A.      Legal Standards 
            
       13.    Under Section 21C(a) of the Exchange Act, the Commission may impose a cease-
and-desist order upon any person who is violating, has violated, or is about to violate any provision 
of the Exchange Act or any regulation thereunder, and upon any other person that is, was, or would 
be a cause of the violation, due to an act or omission the person knew or should have known would 
contribute to such violation. 
        
       14.    The FCPA, enacted in 1977, added Section 13(b)(2)(A) to the Exchange Act to 
require reporting companies to make and keep books, records, and accounts, which, in reasonable 
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of the assets of the issuer.  15 
U.S.C. § 78m(b)(2)(A). 
                
       15.    The FCPA also added Section 13(b)(2)(B) to the Exchange Act to require reporting 
companies to, among other things, devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls 
sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that the transactions: (i) are executed in accordance 
with management’s general or specific authorization; and (ii) are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
(“GAAP”) or any other criteria applicable to such statements, and to maintain accountability for 
assets.  15 U.S.C. § 78m(b)(2)(B). 
        
       B.      Bruker Violated Section 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act 
            
       16.    The Bruker China Offices made payments to Chinese government officials that 
they improperly recorded on their books and records as legitimate business and marketing 
expenses.  The books and records of the Bruker China Offices were consolidated into Bruker’s 
books and records.  As a result of the misconduct of its subsidiaries, Bruker failed to make and 
keep books, records, and accounts which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflected its 

                                                5  
---------------------Page 6---------------------

 
transactions and the disposition of its assets as required by Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange 
Act.   
            
       17.    The improper payments described above took place over several years and 
throughout Bruker’s China operations.  Bruker failed to implement an adequate system of internal 
controls, including an appropriate FCPA compliance and training program at its Bruker China 
Offices, which was commensurate with the risks of doing business in China, and particularly the 
risks of businesses that sold products primarily to SOEs.  Accordingly, in violation of Section 
13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, Bruker failed to devise and maintain a system of internal 
accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that it maintained accountability 
for its assets, and that its transactions were executed in accordance with management’s 
authorization and recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in 
conformity with GAAP.   
        
         Commission Consideration of Bruker’s Cooperation and Remedial Efforts 
        
       18.    In determining to accept the Offer, the Commission considered remedial acts 
promptly undertaken by Bruker and the significant cooperation it afforded to the Commission staff. 
 
                                               IV. 
                                                 
       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in Respondent Bruker’s Offer. 
 
       Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that: 
 
       A.     Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Respondent Bruker cease and desist 
from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 
13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act.   
        
       B.     Respondent shall, within ten (10) days of the entry of this Order, pay $2,399,969 to 
the United States Treasury, including $1,714,852 in disgorgement, $310,117 in prejudgment 
interest, and a civil monetary penalty of $375,000.  If timely payment is not made, additional 
interest shall accrue pursuant to SEC Rule of Practice 600 and 31 U.S.C. § 3717.  Payment must be 
made in one of the following ways:   
        
       (1)     Respondent may transmit payment electronically to the Commission, which will 
       provide detailed ACH transfer/Fedwire instructions upon request;  
        
       (2)     Respondent may make direct payment from a bank account via Pay.gov through 
       the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ofm.htm; or  
        

                                                6  
---------------------Page 7---------------------

 
       (3) Respondent may pay by certified check, bank cashier’s check, or United States postal 
       money order, made payable to the Securities and Exchange Commission and hand-
       delivered or mailed to:  
        
               Enterprise Services Center 
               Accounts Receivable Branch 
               HQ Bldg., Room 181, AMZ-341 
               6500 South MacArthur Boulevard 
               Oklahoma City, OK 73169 
        
       Payments by check or money order must be accompanied by a cover letter identifying 
Bruker as a Respondent in these proceedings, and the file number of these proceedings; a copy of 
the cover letter and check or money order must be sent to Paul G. Block, Assistant Director, 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Unit, Boston Regional Office, Securities and Exchange 
Commission, 33 Arch Street, Suite 2300, Boston, Massachusetts 02110. 
        
       C.     Respondent acknowledges that the Commission is not imposing a civil penalty in 
excess of $375,000 based upon its cooperation in a Commission investigation and related 
enforcement action.  If at any time following the entry of the Order, the Division of Enforcement 
(“Division”) obtains information indicating that Respondent knowingly provided materially false 
or misleading information or materials to the Commission or in a related proceeding, the Division 
may, at its sole discretion and with prior notice to the Respondent, petition the Commission to 
reopen this matter and seek an order directing that the Respondent pay an additional civil penalty.  
Respondent may contest by way of defense in any resulting administrative proceeding whether it 
knowingly provided materially false or misleading information, but may not:  (1) contest the 
findings in the Order; or (2) assert any defense to liability or remedy, including, but not limited to, 
any statute of limitations defense. 
 
       By the Commission.
