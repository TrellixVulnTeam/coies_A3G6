      The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the

of Practice.1

 Rule 102(e)(3)(i) provides, in relevant part, that: 

      The Commission, with due regard to the public interest and without preliminary hearing,

been by name . . . permanently enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction, by reason of his 
or her misconduct in an action brought by the Commission, from violating or aiding and abetting 
the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or of the rules and regulations 
thereunder.

                                              II. 

       In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the 
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings 
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these 
proceedings, and the findings contained in Section III.3. below, which are admitted, Respondent 
consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Rule 102(e) 
of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions 
(“Order”), as set forth below.   

                                              III. 

       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that: 

              1.      Webster, age 46, is a resident of Mission Hills, Kansas.  Webster served as 
president and chief executive officer of American Italian Pasta Company (“AIPC”) from May 1992 
until December 2005, when he left the company.  Webster also served as chief financial officer and 
chief operating officer of AIPC between 1989 and 1992.  Webster was licensed as a Certified 
Public Accountant in Missouri, but his license lapsed in 1991. 

              2.      At all relevant times, AIPC was a Delaware corporation with its principal 
place of business in Kansas City, Missouri.  AIPC is a producer and marketer of dry pasta.  At all 
relevant times, AIPC’s common stock was registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”).  The company filed annual, quarterly, and current reports 
with the Commission on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K, respectively.  AIPC stock was traded on the 
New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) until December 20, 2006, when the NYSE suspended 
trading based on AIPC’s failure to keep current its Commission filings. The NYSE filed a Form 25 
on April 23, 2007 and, as a result, AIPC’s common stock was deregistered from Section 12(b) of 
the Exchange Act effective April 23, 2007.   

              3.      On September 15, 2008, the Commission filed a complaint against Webster 
in United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri (Civil Action No. 4:08-CV-
00674). On September 23, 2008, the court entered an order permanently enjoining Webster, by 
consent, from future violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-
5, 13a-14, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 
13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder.  
The court further ordered that Webster pay $751,978 in disgorgement; $32,610 in prejudgment 
interest; and a $250,000 civil money penalty.  The court further ordered that Webster be barred 
from acting as an officer or director of any issuer that has a class of securities registered pursuant to 
Section 12 of the Exchange Act or that is required to file reports pursuant to Section 15(d) of the 
Exchange Act. 

                                               2

              4.      The Commission’s complaint alleged, among other things, that Webster and 
others at AIPC engaged in a fraudulent scheme that hid from the investing public the true financial 
state of the company by filing materially false and misleading statements in the company’s annual 
reports on Forms 10-K, quarterly reports on Forms 10-Q, and current reports on Forms 8-K, for 
AIPC’s fiscal years 2002, 2003, and 2004.  The complaint alleged that to meet aggressive external 
targets, Webster and others engaged in numerous accounting practices that departed from generally 
accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), including, among other things, capitalizing improperly 
millions of dollars of normal operating costs; understating improperly millions of dollars of trade 
promotion expenses; overstating improperly by millions of dollars the company’s spare parts 
inventory; recognizing improperly millions of dollars of current period revenue on sales of 
products that were not shipped until after the end of the current periods; structuring round-trip cash 
transactions; and eliminating improperly the company’s vacation and paid time off liability. 

                                              IV. 

       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
impose the sanction agreed to in Respondent Webster’s Offer. 

       Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that Webster is 
suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant.

 By       the Commission.
