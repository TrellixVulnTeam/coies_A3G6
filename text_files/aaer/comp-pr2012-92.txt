------------------------------------------------------------------------x  
 
       Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”), for its Complaint 

against defendants China Natural Gas, Inc. (“CHNG”) and Qinan Ji (“Ji”) (collectively, 

“Defendants”), alleges as follows: 

                               SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS   

       1.       This case involves the fraudulent concealment of two related party loans by 

defendant CHNG, a U.S. public corporation, and defendant Ji, CHNG’s chairman and former 

CEO, and CHNG’s failure to timely and properly report a material acquisition in 2008.   

       2.       CHNG is a company based in the People’s Republic of China whose stock is 

registered with the Commission and trades in the United States.  

       3.       In January 2010, CHNG made two short-term loans totaling $14.3 million and 

disclosed them in its filings with the Commission as loans made to unrelated third parties:  one 

($9.9 million) to an individual, Taoxiang Wang (“Wang”), and the other ($4.4 million) to a real 

estate company called Shaanxi Juntai Housing Purchase Co. Ltd. (“Juntai”).  In fact, the true and 

undisclosed purpose of both loans was to benefit a real estate company called Xi’an Demaoxing 

Real Estate Co., Ltd. (“DMX”) that was 90% owned by Ji’s son (“Son”) and 10% owned by Ji’s 

nephew (“Nephew”).  Wang was a sham borrower purposely selected to conceal DMX’s receipt 

of the $9.9 million loan.  Juntai was DMX’s business partner and borrowed $4.4 million from       
---------------------Page 2---------------------

CHNG to undertake a joint real estate project with DMX.  Ji approved the two loans without 

obtaining the requisite approval of CHNG’s board of directors and without informing CHNG’s 

CFO.  Ji instructed his niece’s husband, who was also CHNG’s internal audit chief (“Internal 

Audit Chief”), to arrange both loans.  Upon Ji’s instruction, the Internal Audit Chief located 

Wang to serve as the sham borrower for the $9.9 million loan to DMX.   

       4.      To further conceal the true nature of the loans, Ji falsely told CHNG’s board that 

the loans involved senior Chinese government officials who were in charge of the company’s 

liquid natural gas project.  Ji later repeated this lie to the investing public during the company’s 

quarterly earnings conference call on May 10, 2010.  Subsequently, CHNG’s board authorized 

an internal investigation into the loans, but Ji continued to conceal the related party nature of the 

loans from the internal investigators.  He also lied to CHNG’s external auditors by signing a 

management representation letter in connection with the auditors’ review of CHNG’s periodic 

reports and other filings that falsely stated that the two loans were for business purposes and did 

not involve any related parties.      

       5.      In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2008, CHNG acquired a natural gas company 

but did not timely and properly report the transaction in its filings with the SEC.  As with the two 

related party loans, Ji approved the acquisition without obtaining the prior approval of CHNG’s 

board of directors. 

       6.      By virtue of the conduct alleged herein, CHNG and Ji, directly or indirectly, 

singly or in concert, violated and are otherwise liable for violations of the federal securities laws, 

as follows: 

       (a)     CHNG violated Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) 

[15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)(2)], Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 14(a) of the 

                                                2

       (c)    In the alternative to having directly violated Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act 

[15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)(2)], Ji is liable, pursuant to Section 20(e) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C.     

§ 78t(e)], for aiding and abetting CHNG’s violations of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act [15 

U.S.C. § 77q(a)(2)]. 

       7.      Based on these violations, the Commission seeks a final judgment: (1) 

permanently enjoining CHNG and Ji from future violations of the rele vant provisions of the 

federal securities laws; (2) imposing civil monetary penalties against CHNG and Ji, pursuant to 

Section 20(d) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77t(d)] and Section 21(d)(3) of the Exchange 

Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)(3)]; (3) prohibiting Ji from acting as an officer or director of a public

Ji to reimburse CHNG his bonuses and stock sale profits pursuant to Section 304 of the 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act [15 U.S.C. § 7243].  

                               JURISDICTION AND VENUE  

       8.      The Commission brings this action pursuant to the enforcement authority 

conferred upon it by Section 20(b) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77t(b)] and Section 

21(d)(1) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)(1)].  

       9.      This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(b), 20(d), and 

22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b), 77t(d), and 77v(a)] and Sections 21(d), 21(e), 

and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa].  CHNG and Ji, directly and 

indirectly, have made use of the means or instrumentalities of, or the means or instruments of  

transportation or communication in, interstate commerce, or of the mails, or of the facilities of a 

national securities exchange, in connection with the transactions, acts, practices and courses of 

business alleged herein. 

       10.     Venue is proper in this district pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 

U.S.C. § 77v(a)] and Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa], because certain of the 

transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in this Complaint occurred in the 

Southern District of New York.  During the relevant period, CHNG was registered with the 

Secretary of State of the State of New York as a foreign corporation, and CHNG stock was listed 

and traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market (“NASDAQ”), which is headquartered in New York, 

New York.  

                                       DEFENDANTS  

       11.     China Natural Gas, Inc. is a Delaware corporation that is also registered in New  

York as a foreign corporation.  Headquartered in Xi’an, Shaanxi Province, China, CHNG 

distributes and sells natural gas through fueling stations owned by its variable interest entity

(VIE) Xi’an Xilan Natural Gas Co., Ltd., which in turn owns several subsidiaries in Xi’an and 

other parts of China.  CHNG entered the U.S. capital markets through a reverse merger with a 

pre-existing listed company in December 2005.  CHNG was listed on NASDAQ under the ticker 

symbol “CHNG” from June 2009 to September 21, 2011, when its listing was suspended upon 

the company’s disclosure of the related party nature of the loan to Wang.  CHNG’s common 

stock is currently quoted on the OTC Link (formerly, ‘Pink Sheets’) operated by OTC Markets 

Group Inc. under the symbol “CHNG.PK.”    

       12.     Qinan Ji, age 54, has been the chairman of                                 CHNG’s board of directors since 

February 2006, and was CHNG’s chief executive officer from May 2006 until his resignation on 

October 4, 2011.  He is a Chinese national residing in Xi’an, Shaanxi Province, China.  As of 

June 30, 2011, Ji beneficially owned approximately 14% of the outstanding shares of CHNG, 

and his Son owned 3.39% of the outstanding shares.  

                                  RELEVANT ENTITIES  

       13.     Xi’an Demaoxing Real Estate Co., Ltd.  is a private company based in Xi’an, 

Shaanxi Province, China that was 90% owned by Ji’s Son and 10% owned by Ji’s Nephew.  

       14.     Shaanxi Juntai Housing Purchase Co. Ltd. is a real estate development 

company based in Xi’an, Shaanxi Province, China.   

       15.     Lingbao Yuxi Natural Gas Co., Ltd.  is a gas company located in Lingbao, 

Shaanxi, China that was acquired by CHNG in October 2008.  

                                          FACTS  

A.     Undisclosed Loans to Related Parties  

       16.     In its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2010 filed with the 

Commission, CHNG reported two short-term loans totaling $14.3 million, and disclosed the 

                                             5
 
                                               
---------------------Page 6---------------------

amounts, interest rates and the names of the “third party” borrowers.  The borrower for the first 

loan in the amount of $9.9 million was identified as an individual, Taoxiang Wang (the “Wang 

Loan”), while the borrower for the second loan in the amount of $4.4 million was identified as 

Juntai, a real estate company (the “Juntai Loan”).  For the first quarter of 2010, in its quarterly 

report on Form 10-Q filed with the Commission, CHNG reported total revenues of $19.4 million, 

net income of $4.0 million, and total assets of $202.7 million.  

       1. The Wang Loan          

       17.     CHNG made the Wang Loan in January 2010 through a subsidiary, and the loan 

was purportedly secured by Wang’s 40% equity interest in DMX, a real estate company that at 

the time was 90% owned by Ji’s Son and 10% owned by Ji’s Nephew.  In reality, the loan to 

Wang was a sham because she was introduced to conceal the true borrower, DMX.     

       18.     Ji’s Nephew first approached CHNG to obtain a loan for DMX’s real estate 

development project.  The project was significant in the local community, as it concerned the 

reconstruction of a 27-acre residential village for total potential investment of Chinese yuan 3.6 

billion (approximately $527 million).  Ji approved the loan without telling the company’s board 

or the CFO, and asked his niece’s husband – who was also CHNG’s Internal Audit Chief – to 

arrange the transaction.  The Internal Audit Chief processed the loan with help from another 

finance department employee, but he never discussed the loan with CHNG’s CFO and left the 

CFO to discover the loan through routine internal financial reports.   

       19.      Ji knew it was not appropriate for CHNG to lend money to his Nephew, so he 

asked the Internal Audit Chief to consult an old acquaintance of Ji about finding an intermediary 

for the loan.  The acquaintance produced his friend Wang.  The Internal Audit Chief met Wang 

twice, first in December 2009 and again in January 2010, and Wang agreed to be the borrower in 

                                               6
 
                                                
---------------------Page 7---------------------

name for DMX.  The Internal Audit Chief later fabricated handwritten notes dated December 16, 

2009 that purport to document the December meeting to discuss loan terms with Wang and 

DMX’s real estate development project, although at that time the Internal Audit Chief met Wang 

only to determine whether to use her as an intermediary for the loan.  

       20.     Wang signed the loan agreement, a share transfer agreement with DMX dated 

January 21, 2010 to obtain a 40% equity interest in DMX, and a stock collateral certificate dated 

February 20, 2010.  CHNG’s bank wire slip shows the loan money was wired directly into 

DMX’s bank account on January 25, 2010, with a note stating that the amount was for “raw 

material expenses.”  According to CHNG’s records, DMX repaid the loan on April 22 and April 

27, 2010, prior to maturity, and paid $140,722 as interest on the loan. 

       21.     Ji’s Son owned 90% of DMX and hence was the main beneficiary of any loan to 

DMX.  Ji knew his Son and Nephew were friends and that they were doing business together.  Ji 

also had involved his Son in CHNG’s business over the years. 

       22.     Ji knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that the Wang Loan was made to benefit 

DMX and thus his Son and Nephew. 

       2.     The Juntai Loan  

       23.     At around the same time CHNG made the Wang Loan in January 2010, CHNG 

also made a $4.4 million loan to Juntai, a local real estate development company.  The loan 

agreement contains a personal guarantee by Juntai’s then general manager, who was Ji’s friend.  

Juntai also signed a separate collateral commitment letter dated January 10, 2010, pledging its 

30% equity interest in DMX, although at the time Juntai did not own any DMX stock.  Juntai 

purportedly acquired the 30% interest in DMX pursuant to a share transfer agreement dated 

January 21, 2010 (which was also signed by Wang to “acquire” her DMX stock), and the transfer 

                                              7
 
                                               
---------------------Page 8---------------------

was officially recorded in China’s corporate filings as of March 16, 2010.  According to 

CHNG’s bank records, the loan was paid off on May 26, 2010, together with interest of $87,923. 

       24.     The Juntai Loan was approved and processed at CHNG in the same way as the 

Wang Loan.   Ji approved the loan without tellin g the board or the CFO.  The Internal Audit 

Chief arranged the loan without involving the CFO but with help from the same finance 

department employee and acquaintance of Ji who had helped identify Wang for the other loan.   

       25.     Juntai was DMX’s business partner and borrowed the money from CHNG to 

finance the same real estate development project with DMX that was behind the Wang Loan.  

CHNG’s Internal Audit Chief talked with Ji’s Nephew about the project when arranging the 

Juntai Loan.  Ji knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that the Juntai Loan was made to benefit 

DMX (and thus his Son and Nephew) just as was the Wang Loan.   

B.     Ji Lied to Conceal the Related Party Nature of the Two Loans  

       26.     Ji did not seek prior approval of CHNG’s audit committee and board of directors 

for the two loans, although CHNG’s policies and procedures at the time required board approval 

of all related party and material transactions.  In addition, in processing the two loans, the 

Internal Audit Chief did not obtain the required sign-off by the CFO and relevant department 

manager in accordance with CHNG’s contract approval policy and cash disbursement policy.   

       27.     After the two loans were secretly approved and made, Ji repeatedly lied to 

CHNG’s board, shareholders, and the company’s internal investigation in order to conceal the 

related party nature of the loans. 

       28.     Ji lied to CHNG’s board of directors about the true nature of the two loans.  

CHNG’s audit committee and board first discussed the loans in a May 4, 2010 telephonic 

meeting about the company’s first quarter results.  In response to a comment from an outside 

                                               8
 
                                                
---------------------Page 9---------------------

director that a U.S. public company should not make short term loans, Ji said CHNG could not 

refuse to make the loans because they involved senior government officers who were in charge 

of CHNG’s liquid natural gas project.   

       29.     Subsequently, during CHNG’s quarterly earnings conference call on May 10, 

2010, in response to a question about the loans, Ji again stated that CHNG had to make the two 

loans to obtain the necessary approvals for its liquid natural gas project from government 

officials.  

       30.     Ji’s statements during the earnings call triggered regulatory inquiries into 

potential Foreign Corrupt Practices Act violations, and on June 8, 2010, CHNG’s board met to 

discuss these concerns.  At the board meeting, Ji changed his explanation and said he made the 

loans to earn quick and lucrative interest.  On June 21, 2010, the board had another meeting and 

authorized a special investigation by outside counsel.   

       31.     During the board meetings on June 8 and June 21, 2010, Ji did not disclose to the 

board the involvement of any related parties in the loans, although by this time, Ji knew that his 

Son owned 90% of DMX and was the primary beneficiary of the Wang Loan.  Ji and the Internal 

Audit Chief formally apologized to the board, but only for approving and processing the loans 

without informing senior management and the board.   

       32.     Ji continued to lie about the loans during the company’s internal investigation.  

He also instructed the Internal Audit Chief not to produce any document to the internal 

investigation that would reveal the involvement of his Son and Nephew in the loans.  As a result, 

the Internal Audit Chief produced to the internal investigation the false meeting notes he had 

generated that purported to document a December 16, 2009 meeting with Wang to discuss terms 

for the Wang Loan and the real estate development project.

C.     CHNG’s False Public Filings About the Two Loans   

       33.     As a U.S. public company, CHNG filed with the Commission periodic reports and 

other filings, including annual, quarterly and current reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, as 

well as proxy statements and registration statements.   

       34.     Both Commission regulations and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 

(“GAAP”) require that a public company, such as CHNG, disclose related party transactions.  

Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K requires disclosure of transactions exceeding $120,000 in which a 

public company’s director, executive officer or any member of their immediate families has a 

direct or indirect material interest.  FASB Accounting Standards Codification 850 (“Codification 

850”), formerly known as Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 57, provides that 

financial statements shall include disclosures of material related party transactions.  Rule 4-08(k) 

of Regulation S-X provides that related party transactions should be identified and the amounts 

stated on the face of the balance sheet, income statement, or statement of cash flows.  Items 8 

and 13 of Form 10-K require the related party disclosures prescribed by Item 404 of Regulation 

S-K, Rule 4-08 of Regulation S-X, and Codification 850.     

       35.     The Wang Loan falls within the definition of a related party transaction that is 

required to be disclosed, since the real borrower was DMX, a company 90% owned by Ji’s Son.  

       36.     The Juntai Loan also constitutes a related party transaction required to be 

disclosed because DMX, the company 90% owned by Ji’s Son, had a direct material interest in 

the loan.  Juntai was DMX’s business partner and borrowed money from CHNG to undertake a 

joint real estate project with DMX.  Since the loan was made to finance the joint real estate 

project of Juntai and DMX, DMX and hence Ji’s Son had a direct material interest in the Juntai  

Loan.

---------------------Page 11---------------------

       37.     From May 2010 through present, CHNG filed with the Commission periodic 

reports, proxy statements and a registration statement that materially misrepresented and/or 

omitted to disclose the related party nature of the Wang Loan and/or Juntai Loan.   

       38.     CHNG’s Forms 10-Q for the first three quarters of 2010 falsely and misleadingly 

described the two loans as loans to third parties, and failed to disclose the involvement of any 

related parties.  CHNG’s Form 10-K for 2010 did not contain any required disclosure for the two 

related party loans.  Ji signed these periodic reports as CHNG’s CEO.  He also signed a 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 302 certification for these reports, in which he certified that he had 

reviewed each report and that: (1) based on his knowledge, the report did not contain any untrue 

statement of material fact; (2) based on his knowledge, the financial statements and other 

financial information fairly presented, in all material respects, the financial condition and results 

of operations; and (3) he was responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal 

controls over financial reporting, had designed and evaluated such controls, and had disclosed 

any changes or weaknesses to CHNG’s auditor and audit committee.  At the time he signed the 

2010 periodic reports and certifications, he knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that these 

reports contained materially false and misleading misrepresentations or omissions concerning the 

two loans.  

       39.     On October 29, 2010 and April 29, 2011, CHNG filed with the Commission, and 

sent to its shareholders, its annual proxy statements on Schedule DEF 14A, pursuant to which Ji 

was re-elected to CHNG’s board of directors.  Each proxy statement stated that the proxy was 

solicited on behalf of the company’s board of directors.  Item 7 of Schedule 14A requires the 

disclosure of related party transactions pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K.  Because of Ji’s 

fraudulent conduct, CHNG failed to disclose the Wang Loan and Juntai Loan as related party 

                                               11
 
                                                 
---------------------Page 12---------------------

transactions in the two proxy statements.  Ji signed the transmittal letters to the shareholders as 

chairman of the board and CEO of CHNG, and was the proxy appointed in connection with the 

proxy solicitations on behalf of CHNG’s board.  Ji knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that 

the proxy statements contained material omissions regarding the Wang Loan and Juntai Loan.  

As chairman and CEO, Ji caused CHNG’s shareholders to be solicited regarding CHNG’s annual 

meetings when he knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that substantial loans to his family 

members were nowhere described in the proxy statements and financial statements provided to 

shareholders.  Ji directly benefited from the proxy by retaining his seat as director through the 

filing of these materially false and misleading proxy statements.   

       40.     CHNG filed a registration statement on Form S-8 on April 30, 2010 covering 

shares of its common stock issuable to its employees, officers and consultants pursuant to the 

company’s 2009 Employee Stock Option and Stock Award Plan.  The registration statement was 

signed by Ji and incorporated by reference CHNG’s periodic filings with the Commission for the 

relevant period.  Ji signed the registration statement, while he knew, or was reckless in not 

knowing, that it incorporated by reference materially false and misleading statements and 

omissions with respect to the related party nature of the Wang Loan and Juntai Loan.   

       41.     On September 21, 2011, CHNG filed a current report on Form 8-K, in which 

CHNG disclosed the Wang Loan as a related party loan and announced restatements of its 

financial statements.  The Form 8-K, however, did not disclose the Juntai Loan as a related party 

transaction, and did not accurately describe Ji’s misconduct in approving and concealing the true 

nature of the two loans.  Ji knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that this filing contained 

materially false and misleading statements and omissions with respect to the related party nature 

of the Juntai Loan and his fraudulent conduct. 

                                               12
 
                                                
---------------------Page 13---------------------

       42.     On December 28, 2011, CHNG filed an amended Form 10-K for 2010 and 

amended Forms 10-Q for the first three quarters of 2010, which contained restatements of its 

financial statements for the covered periods.  However, none of these amended periodic reports 

disclosed the related party nature of the Juntai Loan.  

D.     Misrepresentation to CHNG’s Auditors  

       43.     CHNG’s auditors learned about the Wang Loan and Juntai Loan when examining 

company ledgers during their review of CHNG’s first quarter financials.  The auditors asked 

CHNG for details about the loans, including whether any related party was involved, and were 

told that the loans had been made to third parties and no related party was involved.  The 

auditors then asked for a legal opinion on the absence of related parties, and CHNG provided a 

legal opinion to this effect from its local legal counsel for the Wang Loan and Juntai Loan.   

       44.     Ji misled CHNG’s outside auditors to conceal the related party nature of the two 

loans.  In his capacity as CHNG’s CEO, Ji signed a management representation letter to CHNG’s 

auditors dated May 7, 2010 in connection with their review of CHNG’s interim report for the 

first quarter of 2010.  The letter stated that the Wang Loan and Juntai Loan were “for business 

purpose[s]” and the borrowers “are not . . . related parties.”  This is false because the loans did 

not have a business purpose but rather were made to benefit a company 90% owned by Ji’s son, 

the true borrower.  Ji knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that he made materially false and 

misleading statements in the management representation letter provided to CHNG’s auditors. 

E.      False Books and Records and Inadequate Internal Controls at CHNG  
 
       45.     As a result of Ji’s misconduct, CHNG’s books and records falsely and 

inaccurately reflected the true nature of the Wang Loan and the Juntai Loan.  The documentation 

of the Wang Loan, including the loan approvals, the loan documents, and notes reflecting a 

                                              13
 
                                                
---------------------Page 14---------------------

meeting with Wang, was false because it failed to reflect the actual related party borrower.  

Similarly, the documentation for the Juntai Loan failed to identify Juntai as DMX’s business 

partner and thus reflect that the loan was made for Juntai to undertake a joint business project 

with DMX, a company owned by Ji’s Son and Nephew.  In addition, because Ji concealed the 

true nature of both loans, CHNG’s board meeting minutes failed to contain any discussion 

regarding the related party nature of the loans.  CHNG also obtained and maintained legal 

opinions that falsely state that the two loans were made for business purposes and did not involve 

any related party. 

       46.     Ji directed the Internal Audit Chief to orchestrate the Wang Loan so as to conceal 

the true borrower, and he lied to conceal the related party nature of the loans.  Ji also signed 

internal loan approval forms and/or loan documents that failed to identify the related parties.   

       47.     CHNG failed to devise and maintain internal controls sufficient to ensure that it 

accurately reported the related party loans.  Ji, CHNG’s most senior officer, and CHNG’s 

Internal Audit Chief were able to perpetrate the fraud without any impediment or knowledge by 

the company’s board or CFO.  Ji knowingly circumvented CHNG’s internal controls by 

approving the loans without prior approval of the board and its audit committee, and by directing 

the Internal Audit Chief to process the loans without the necessary internal approvals.   

F. Violation of             Sarbanes-Oxley Section 304  
 
       48.     Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that, if an issuer “is required to 

prepare an accounting restatement due to its material noncompliance, as a result of misconduct, 

with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws,” its CEO or CFO shall repay 

to the issuer any bonuses, incentive or equity based compensation and/or stock sale profits he or 

she receives within twelve months of the issuance of a the noncompliant financial document or 

                                               14
 
                                                 
---------------------Page 15---------------------

filing (whichever occurs first).  CHNG has restated its financial statements for fiscal year 2010 

and the first three quarters of 2010.  During the applicable period under Section 304 of the 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Ji received a bonus of $60,000 in 2010, and sold 36,500 shares of CHNG 

stock in August 2010 for $77,479 in profit.  Ji has not reimbursed CHNG the bonus and trading 

profit. 

G.     Late and Inadequate Disclosure of a Material Acquisition  

       49.     CHNG’s variable interest entity (VIE) entered into an agreement to acquire a 

local gas company, Lingbao Yuxi Natural Gas Co., Ltd. (“Yuxi”), on October 2, 2008 for about 

$19.6 million, or 35% of CHNG’s 2007 total assets, and completed the acquisition in November 

2008.  As with the Wang Loan and Juntai Loan, Ji approved the acquisition without obtaining the 

prior approval of the company’s board of directors.  CHNG did not disclose the acquisition until 

December 31, 2008, when it filed a Form 8-K to report the entry of the acquisition agreement.  

Moreover, CHNG was required, but failed, to include in the Form 8-K Yuxi’s financial 

statements and pro forma information because the assets acquired comprised 35% of CHNG’s 

total assets.  The Form 8-K also failed to report that CHNG had completed the acquisition in 

November 2008.
