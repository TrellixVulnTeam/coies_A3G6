                                             I.  
 
       The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the 
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against Michael 
J. Moore (“Moore”) and Moore & Associates Ch artered (“M&A”) (“Respondents”) pursuant to  
Rule 102(e)(3)(i) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice.1 
                                                        
                                              
                                            II.  
 
       In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondents have submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the 

                                                 
1
 Rule 102(e)(3)(i) provides, in relevant part, that: 
 
       The Commission, with due regard to the public interest and without preliminary hearing, 
may, by order, . . . suspend from appearing or practicing before it any . . . accountant . . . who has 
been by name . . . permanently enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction, by reason of his 
or her misconduct in an action brought by the Commission, from violating or aiding and abetting 
the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or of the rules and regulations

purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings 
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over them and the subject matter of these 
proceedings, and the findings contained in Section III.3. below, which are admitted, Respondents 
consent to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Rule 102(e) of 
the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions 
(“Order”), as set forth below.   
 
                                             III.  
 
       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that:  
                                              
              1.      Michael J. Moore,                 age 55, is a resident of Las Vegas, Nevada.  Moore is a 
certified public accountant, currently licensed in Texas (1984 to 1994 and 2000 to present) and 
Nevada (2000 to present).  Moore is the president and majority owner of Moore & Associates 
Chartered (“M&A”).  Moore was M&A’s only CPA from its inception through 2008 and the  
auditor with final responsibility for all M&A audits during those years. 
 
              2.      M&A is a Nevada corporation and public accounting firm headquartered in  
Las Vegas, Nevada.  M&A is registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
(“PCAOB”). 
 
              3.      On August 27, 2009, the  Commission filed a complaint against Moore and 
M&A in SEC v. Michael J. Moore, et al. , Civil Action No. 2:09-cv-01637-LDG-GWF, in the 
United States District Court for the District of Nevada.  On September 25, 2009, the court entered 
an order permanently enjoining Moore and M&A, by consent, from future violations of Sections 
10(b), 10A(a)(1) and 10A(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) [15 
U.S.C. §§ 78j(b), 78j-1(a)(1), and 78j-l(b)(1)] and Rule 10b-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-
5], and Regulation S-X Rules 2-02(b)(1) and 2-06 [17 C.F.R. §§ 210.2-02(b)(1) and 210.2-06].  
Moore and M&A were ordered to pay jointly and severally disgorgement of $179,750.00 and 
prejudgment interest of $10,151.59 for a total of $189,901.59.  Moore was also ordered to pay a 
civil money penalty of $130,000.00. 
 
              4.      The Commission’s complaint alleged, among other things, that Moore and 
M&A issued unqualified audit reports in connection with its audits of Ethos Environmental, Inc. 
(2007-2008); Tombstone Exploration Corporation (2006-2007); Studio One  Media, Inc. (2006-
2008); Biocoral, Inc. (2005-2007); Centergistic Solutions, Inc. (2006-2007); and Standard 
Drilling, Inc. (2006-2008) that falsely stated that their audits were conducted in accordance with 
PCAOB Standards and that the entities’ financial statements were fairly presented in accordance 
with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.  The complaint further alleged that, 
contrary to the representation in the audit reports, Moore and M&A’s audits failed to meet 
numerous PCAOB Standards and were so deficient that they amounted to no audits at all.  
Among other things, Moore and M&A’s employees lacked adequate technical training and 
proficiency as auditors, and Moore and M&A failed to train or supervise these employees; the 
audits were not properly planned; and Moore  and M&A failed to obtain sufficient competent 

                                               2

evidential matter to afford a reasonable basis for an opinion regarding the financial statements  
under audit or to perform any meaningful audit procedures, even when there were red flags that 
the financial statements were materially misstated.  The complaint further alleged that Moore and 
M&A improperly modified audit documentation.  By their conduct, Moore and M&A violated 
Sections 10(b), 10A(a)(1), and10A(b)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and 
Regulation S-X Rules 2-02(b)(1) and 2-06. 
  
                                                         IV. 
                                                            
         In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
impose the sanction agreed to in Respondents’ Offer. 
 
         Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that Respondents are                    
suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission as accountants.   
 
 By the Commission.
