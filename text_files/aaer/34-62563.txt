       The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate that public 
administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Sections 
4C1
    and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rule 102(e)(1)(iii) of 
the Commission’s Rules of Practice2
                                    against Kenneth J. Abod, CPA (“Abod” or “Respondent”).

                                               II.  
 
       In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an offer of  
settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the purpose 
of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the Commission, or to 
which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings  herein, except as 
to the Commission’s jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these proceedings, which are  
admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-
Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 4C and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and 
Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial  
Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”), as set forth below.   
 
                                               III.  
 
       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds 3
                                                                                 that:  
 
                                           Summary  
 
       1.      These proceedings arise out of Abod’s failures to comply with Generally Accepted 
Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) at Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. (“Sunrise” or the “Company”) for 
the year-end 2004 and the first fiscal quarter of 2005.  Abod helped determine the amount of the  
2004 year-end bonus accrual and was aware that Sunrise was planning to pay $1 million in 2004 
bonuses in 2005 but had failed to accrue for them at 2004 fiscal year-end.  Abod also instructed 
Sunrise employees to make an adjustment to eliminate the corporate bonus accrual account for the 
first quarter of 2005, ended on March 31, 2005.  Sunrise would not have met previously issued 
earnings per share (“EPS”) forecasts if it had properly accrued for bonuses at year end 2004 and 
the first fiscal quarter of 2005.  The accounting for the corporate bonus accrual account failed to 
comply with GAAP, because it was probable that Sunrise was going to pay bonuses and could 
reasonably estimate the bonus payment amounts.  Consequently, Abod caused Sunrise to issue an 
annual report for fiscal year 2004 and a quarterly report for the first quarter of 2005 that failed to 
comply with GAAP.  On March 24, 2008, Sunrise  filed a Form 10-K for the year ended December  
31, 2007.  The filing included restated audited financial statements for fiscal year 2004, and 
unaudited quarterly financial information for fiscal years 2005 (restated).  The restatement 
corrected the improper accounting for the bonus accruals. 
 
                                        Respondent  
 
       2.      Abod, 45, who is a licensed CP A in Virginia, was Sunrise’s Treasurer from 2001 
until December 1, 2005, when he resigned from the Company.  As Treasurer, he was responsible  
for maintaining corporate forecasts, facilitating the budget process, and managing Sunrise’s cash 
position.  He was in charge of Sunrise’s investor relations department from mid-2004 until 
December 1, 2005.

 The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent’s offer of settlement and are not binding on any   
other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

                                     Other Relevant Party  
 
       3.     Sunrise  is a Delaware Corporation headquartered in McLean, Virginia.  Its  
securities are registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, and the Company’s 
common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol SRZ.  Sunrise is a 
provider of residential communities and services for the elderly.  Sunrise has a fiscal year end of 
December 31. 
 
                                             Facts  
 
       4.     On November 4, 2004, as part of its earnings call for the 2004 third quarter, ended 
on September 30, 2004, Sunrise publicly stated that it estimated its EPS would between be $.55 to 
$.59 per share for the fourth quarter.   
        
       5.     Sunrise improperly accounted for approximately $2.8 million of 2004 bonuses so it 
could meet 2004 earnings guidance.  Of the $2.8 million, Sunrise failed to accrue at all for 
approximately $1 million as of December 31, 2004.  Abod helped determine the amount of the  
year-end bonus accrual and was aware that Sunrise was planning to pay $1 million in 2004 
bonuses in 2005 but had failed to accrue for them at 2004 fiscal year-end.  Sunrise’s failure to 
accrue for the bonuses did not comply with GAAP, because it was probable that Sunrise was going 
to pay the bonuses and could reasonably estimate the bonus amounts.  Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standards No. 5 (“FAS 5”) requires that ‘[a]n estimated loss from a loss contingency . 
. . shall be accrued by a charge to income” if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the 
amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. 
        
       6.     On March 7, 2005, Sunrise reported fourth quarter earnings of $.57 per share.  
Sunrise’s failure to treat the approximately $1 million of bonuses paid in 2005 as a 2004 expense 
overstated Sunrise’s EPS for the 2004 fourth quarter by approximate ly $.03 (approximately 5%).  
Without the improper adjustment to the corporate bonus accrual account, Sunrise would have 
reported fourth quarter EPS of $.54, $.01 per share short of its fourth quarter EPS guidance.   
 
       7.     On April 19, 2005, approximately two weeks after Sunrise’s March 31, 2005 
quarter ended, Abod prepared a spreadsheet entitled “Analysis of Q1 2005.”  The spreadsheet 
listed a number of adjustments “[n]eeded” to increase Sunrise’s pre-tax income for the March 31 
quarter by $2.8 million.  The spreadsheet listed adjustments that would allow Sunrise to increase 
EPS from $.29 to $.37, the low end of its EPS forecast made on March 7, 2005.  The spreadsheet 
included an adjustment to eliminate the 2005 year-to-date corporate bonus accrual.   
 
       8.     That same day, Abod instructed Sunrise employees to eliminate the 2005 corporate 
bonus accrual then reflected on Sunrise’s books and records, improperly boosting Sunrise’s 
earnings by $725,000.  This bonus accrual adjustment was not in accordance with GAAP because 
it was not the result of a determination that the payment of 2005 corporate bonuses was not 
probable and reasonably estimable.  If Sunrise had not improperly reversed the bonus accrual, it 
would have missed its EPS forecast for the quarter by approximately $.02 per share.

---------------------Page 4---------------------

 
       9.     On March 24, 2008, Sunrise filed a Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 
2007.  The filing included restated audited financial statements for fiscal years 2004 and 2005, 
audited financial statements for fiscal year 2006, and unaudited quarterly financial information for 
fiscal years 2005 (restated) and 2006.  The restatement corrected the improper accounting for the 
bonus accruals described in paragraphs 4-8 above.    
        
                                           Violations  
 
       1.     Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 
require issuers with securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act to file quarterly 
and annual reports with the Commission and to keep this information current.  Exchange Act 
Rule 12b-20 further requires that, in addition to the information expressly required to be included 
in such reports, the issuer must include such additional material information as may be necessary 
to make the required statements, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not 
misleading.  The obligation to file such reports also embodies the requirement that they be true 
and correct.  See, e.g., SEC v. Savoy Indus., Inc., 587 F.2d 1149, 1165 (D.C. Cir. 1978). 
Exchange Act Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 also require issuers to file annual and quarterly financial 
statements that comply with Regulation S-X.  Regulation S-X, Section 4-01(a) mandates that 
financial statements and the accompanying notes be presented in conformity with GAAP.  No 
showing of scienter is necessary to establish a violation of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and 
Rules 13a-1, 13a-13, and 12b-20 thereunder.  See SEC v. McNulty, 137 F.3d 732, 740-741 (2d 
Cir. 1998). 
 
        
       2.     Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act requires Section 12 registrants to make  
and keep books, records, and accounts that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and 
dispositions of their assets.  Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act requires issuers to devise and 
maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in 
conformity with GAAP and to maintain the accountability of assets.  No showing of scienter is 
necessary to establish a violation of Exchange Act Sections 13(b)(2)(A) or 13(b)(2)(B).                                          See 
McNulty at 740-741. 
        
       3.     Section 13(b)(5) of the  Exchange Act provides that  no person shall knowingly 
falsify any such book, record, or account or circumvent internal controls.  Exchange Act Rule  
13b2-1 also prohibits the falsification of any book, record, or account subject to Exchange Act 
Section 13(b)(2)(A). 
        
       4.     By failing to accrue for bonuses as required by FAS 5, misstating its financial 
results in its Form 10-K for its fiscal year 2004 and in its Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2005, 
Sunrise violated Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 
and 13a-13 thereunder.   

       5.     Abod helped determine the amount of the 2004 year-end bonus accrual and was 
aware that Sunrise was planning to pay $1 million in 2004 bonuses in 2005 but had failed to accrue 
                                                 
                                                4

for them at 2004 fiscal year-end.  Abod also instructed Sunrise employees to make an adjustment 
to eliminate the corporate bonus accrual account for the first quarter of 2005, ended on March 31, 
2005.  Abod knew or should have known that Sunrise’s Form  10-K for the year ended December 
31, 2004 and Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2005 materially overstated Sunrise’s 
reported net income.  As a result of his conduct, Abod willfully4
                                                                 violated Exchange Act Section 
13(b)(5) and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder and caused and willfully aided and abetted Sunrise’s 
violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 
13a-13 thereunder.   
                                                  
                                             Findings  
        
       1.      Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that Abod willfully violated  
Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Rule 13b2-1, and caused and willfully aided and abetted 
Sunrise’s violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and Rules 12b-20, 
13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder. 
        
       2.      Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that Abod willfully violated and 
willfully aided and abetted the violation of provisions of the federal securities laws and rules 
thereunder within the meaning of Exchange Act Section 4C and Rule 102(e)(1)(iii) of the 
Commission’s Rules of Practice. 
 
                                                IV. 
                                                  
        In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in the Respondent’s Offer.  
 
        Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:  
 
       A.      Abod shall cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any 
future violations of Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, and from  
causing any violations and any future violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 
13(b)(2)(B) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder.    
        
       B.      Abod is denied the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission as 
an accountant. 
 
       C.      After one year from the date of this order, Respondent may request that the  
Commission consider his reinstatement by submitting an application (attention: Office of the  
Chief Accountant) to resume appearing or practicing before the Commission as: 
      
                                1. a preparer or reviewer, or a person responsible for the preparation or 
review, of any public company’s financial statements that are filed with the Commission.  Such

 A willful violation of the securities laws means merely “‘                   that the person charged with the duty knows what he is   
doing.’”  Wonsover v. SEC    , 205 F.3d 408, 414 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (quoting Hughes v. SEC   , 174 F.2d 969, 977 (D.C.  
Cir. 1949)).

an application must satisfy the Commission that Respondent’s work in his practice before the 
Commission will be reviewed either by the independent audit committee of the public company 
for which he works or in some other acceptable manner, as long as he practices before the 
Commission in this capacity; and/or  
      
                2.       an independent accountant.  Such an application must satisfy the 
Commission that: 
      
                            (a)  Respondent, or the public accounting firm with which he is 
associated, is registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight            Board (“Board”) in 
accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and such registration continues to be effective; 
 
                         (b)     Respondent, or the registered     public accounting firm with which he 
is associated, has been inspected by the Board and that inspection did not identify any criticisms  
of or potential defects in the respondent’s or the firm’s quality control system that would indicate 
that the respondent will not receive appropriate supervision; 

                 (c)             Respondent has resolved all di     sciplinary issues with the Board, and 
has complied with all terms and conditions of any sanctions imposed by the Board (other than 
reinstatement by the Commission); and 
 
                         (d)     Respondent acknowledges        his responsibility, as long as 
Respondent appears or practices before the Commission as an independent accountant, to 
comply with all requirements of the Commission and the Board, including, but not limited to, all 
requirements relating to registration, inspections, concurring partner reviews and quality control 
standards. 
 
                    D. The Commission will consider an application by Respondent to resume  
appearing or practicing before the Commission provided that his state CPA license is 
current and he has resolved all other disciplinary issues with the applicable state boards of 
accountancy.  However, if state licensure is dependent on reinstatement by the 
Commission, the Commission will consider an application on its other merits.  The 
Commission’s review may include consideration of, in addition to the matters referenced 
above, any other matters relating to Respondent’s character, integrity, professional conduct, 
or qualifications to appear or practice before the Commission.
