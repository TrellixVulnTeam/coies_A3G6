                                               III. 
 
              On the basis of this Order and Respondents Offer, the Commission finds1
                                                                                 that:  
 
                                           Summary 
 
              This matter arises out of certain improper accounting at UCAP, Inc. concerning its fiscal 
year ended September 30, 2002.  At all relevant times, Moudy was UCAPs former chief executive 
officer (CEO), and knew or should have known that UCAP overstated mortgage revenue during 
fiscal year 2002.  Specifically, Moudy caused UCAP to record only half of an adjustment 
necessary to make the companys financial statements comply with generally accepted accounted 
principles (GAAP).  Moudy knew or should have known that failing to record the full mortgage 
revenue adjustment enabled UCAP to meet improperly a key financial covenant required to save 
the companys sole line of credit. 
 
                                        Respondent 
 
                     1.           Moudy, 57, of Benton, Arkansas, was UCAPs CEO from approximately 
November 2001 through May 2003, and again from approximately mid-October 2003 through 
February 28, 2004.  Moudy also served as UCAPs chairman of the board from approximately 
November 2001 through April 20, 2004.  
                                               
                                  Other Relevant Entities 
 
  2. UCAP,                                                              a Colorado corporation, operated a mortgage banking business until 
it ceased operations on or about April 30, 2004.  UCAP operated through its wholly-owned 
subsidiary, United Capital Mortgage Corporation (UCMC).  UCMCs principal place of business 
was in Aurora, Colorado.  UCMC filed for bankruptcy protection on November 2, 2004.  UCAPs 
common stock was registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act 
from 1996 through August 23, 2005, and pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 
13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder, the company was obligated to file reports on Forms 10-KSB and 
10-QSB during that time period.  On August 23, 2005, the Commission revoked UCAPs securities 
registration pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Exchange Act.  From July 2002 through August 23, 
2005, UCAPs common stock was quoted on www.pinksheets.com, a service of Pink Sheets LLC.  
Prior to July 2002, it was quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, a service of the NASDAQ Stock 
Market, Inc.  Neither UCAP nor UCMC have any current operations.

         The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent's Offer of Settlement and are not binding 
on any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

                                        Background 
 
              4.     UCAP, through its operating subsidiary, UCMC, provided mortgage 
banking services to consumers nationwide.  The companys mortgage revenue consisted of 
mortgage origination fees (the fees earned when borrowers closed on the loans), and the gain or 
loss on the sale of mortgages in the secondary market.  The companys revenue, therefore, was 
contingent upon the volume of loans it placed and how quickly it could prepare mortgages for sale 
in the secondary market. 

              5.     In fiscal years ended September 30, 2002 and 2003, among other things, 
UCAP planned to increase loan originations in order to increase revenue and the price of UCAPs 
common stock.  UCAPs mortgage business was dependent on UCMCs single line of credit, 
which funded the mortgages that were originated.  Significant increases to the line of credit were 
necessary to support UCAPs growth.  Through its sole lender, the available credit grew from 
approximately $30 million in January 2002 to at least $125 million in September 2002.  UCAPs 
lender required that certain financial covenants be met to maintain the line of credit.  With respect 
to fiscal year 2002, among other things, (a) UCAPs subsidiary, UCMC, was required to maintain a 
minimum $5 million tangible net worth; and (b) UCAP and UCMC were required to maintain 
audited financial statements pursuant to GAAP.  

                         Improper Mortgage Revenue Adjustment 

              6.     As early as fiscal year ended September 30, 2001, UCMC had not been 
recognizing mortgage revenue in accordance with GAAP.  Specifically, UCMC had been 
recognizing mortgage revenue at the time borrowers closed mortgage loans, rather than when loans 
were sold in the secondary market as required by GAAP.  UCAPs external auditor stated that he 
requested the company make an adjustment to UCAPs consolidated financial statements for fiscal 
year 2001 to correct the error.  UCAPs auditor was informed that UCAP was in the process of 
purchasing a computer system that would enable UCMC to more easily track loans from 
origination through sale in the secondary market, and therefore the revenue recognition problem 
would be corrected in fiscal year 2002.  On that basis, Moudy and others agreed to wait until fiscal 
year 2002 to address the adjustment.  Moudy and others failed, however, to take adequate action to 
provide reasonable assurances in fiscal year 2002 that UCMC devised and maintained internal 
controls sufficient to recognize mortgage revenue properly under GAAP while the company was 
implementing the new computer system.   

              7.     While conducting UCAPs audit field work for the fiscal year ended 
September 30, 2002, UCAPs auditor determined that UCMC was continuing improperly to 
recognize mortgage revenue.  UCAPs auditor informed Moudy that a $1.67 million adjustment to 
revenue was necessary to make UCAPs fiscal year 2002 financial statements comply with GAAP.  
Moudy at first agreed that the full amount of the revenue error, or $1.67 million, would be recorded 
in UCAPs fiscal year 2002 consolidated financial statements in order to comply with GAAP.  At 
an October 22, 2002 board of directors meeting, Moudy discussed the change in accounting for 
mortgage revenue. 

                                              3 
---------------------Page 4---------------------

              8.     Thereafter, at or about the time UCAPs consolidated fiscal year 2002 
financial statements were being finalized, Moudy learned that UCMC might be in breach of the 
lenders $5 million minimum tangible net worth covenant.  In or about early January 2003, Moudy 
approved recording half of the required $1.67 million revenue adjustment in UCAPs fiscal year 
2002 financial statements and recording half in UCAPs fiscal year 2003 financial statements as a 
means of meeting the lenders minimum tangible net worth covenant. 

              9.     Moudy knew or should have known that failing to book the full adjustment 
would not correct the GAAP error in fiscal year 2002.  Moudy failed to inform UCAPs board of 
directors or audit committee that only half the revenue adjustment would be taken. 

              10.    Moudy knew or should have known that recording only half of the required 
$1.67 million revenue adjustment was in contravention to GAAP.  On January 15, 2003, Moudy 
caused UCAPs fiscal year 2002 consolidated financial statements, included in UCAPs Form 10-
KSB filed with the Commission, to include only half of the necessary $1.67 million revenue 
adjustment.  As a result, UCAPs 2002 Form 10-KSB understated the companys pre-tax loss by 
$378,000 or seven percent. 

              11.    Also on January 15, 2003, Moudy caused UCAP to issue an earnings 
release for fiscal 2002.  Moudy should have known that the release incorrectly reported $730,000 
in pre-tax income, excluding non-recurring restructuring charges, resulting in an overstatement of 
107 percent.  UCAP should have reported a pre-tax income, excluding non-recurring restructuring 
charges, of $353,000. 

                                       Legal Discussion 

              12.    Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13a-1 thereunder require all 
issuers with securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act to file annual reports with 
the Commission on Form 10-K.  These reporting requirements necessarily include the requirement 
that the issuer supply accurate information.  In addition, Rule 12b-20 requires that reports contain 
such further material information as may be necessary to make the required statements, in light of 
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.  As a result of the conduct 
described above, UCAP violated, and Moudy caused UCAPs violations of, Section 13(a) of the 
Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder, with respect to UCAPs Form 10-KSB for 
the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002. 

              13.    Also as a result of the conduct described above, UCAP violated, and Moudy 
caused UCAPs violations of, Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act, which requires reporting 
companies to make and keep books, records, and accounts which, in reasonable detail, accurately 
and fairly reflect their transactions and dispositions of their assets, and Section 13(b)(2)(B), which 
requires reporting companies to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls 
sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP.

            In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in Respondent Moudys Offer. 
 
            Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that: 
 
 Respondent Moudy ceas                                e and desist from causing any violations and any future violations 
of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 
thereunder.
