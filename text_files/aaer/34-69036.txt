_______________________________________ 
 
      The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) instituted this proceeding with  
an Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings (OIP) on August 10, 2012, pursuant to Section 
15(b)(6) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934   (Exchange Act), Sections 203(e), 203(f), and 
203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940   (Advisers Act), Sections 9(b) and 9(f) of the 
Investment Company Act of 1940      (Investment Company Act), and Rule 102(e) of the 
Commissions Rules of Practice (Commission Rules).   
 
      I held a telephonic prehearing conference on September 27, 2012, at which time I found 
that Respondents were served with the OIP no later than September 10, 2012.  Commission Rule 
220(b) requires Respondents to file their Answers to the OIP within twenty days after service.  
OIP at 7; 17 C.F.R. § 201.220(b).  At the prehearing conference, the parties represented that they 
were actively engaged in settlement discussions, and I postponed sine die  the due date for 
Respondents to file their Answers.  I held a second telephonic prehearing conference on October 
24, 2012.  Respondents represented that they were still interested in pursuing settlement 
discussions, and I ordered Respondents to file their Answers by November 16, 2012.   
       
      Respondents failed to file Answers to the OIP, and on November 19, 2012, I ordered 
Respondents to show cause why they should not be deemed in default and have the proceeding 
determined against them.   See  17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(2), .220(f).  Respondents failed to 
respond to the show cause order.    On January 15, 2013, I held a third telephonic prehearing 
---------------------Page 2---------------------

conference, in which Respondents failed to participate.  Respondents are therefore in default for 
failing to answer the OIP, respond to the show cause order, participate in a prehearing 
conference, or otherwise defend the proceeding.  See  17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), .220(f) , .221(f).  
Accordingly,  the allegations in the OIP are deemed true    and this proceeding is determined 
against them by default.  
        
       On December 5, 2012, I issued an order finding Respondents in default and directing the 
Division of Enforcement (Division) to file a motion requesting relief and supported by sufficient 
evidence consistent with Rapoport v. SEC   , 682 F.3d 98 (D.C. Cir. 2012).  On December 26, 
2012, the Division filed a Motion for Sanctions Against Respondents Peak Wealth Opportunities 
and David W. Dube (Motion), to which was attached 13  exhibits (Exhs. 1-13).  At t  he January 
15, 2013 prehearing conference, I expressed concern about the strength and nature of the case 
against Respondents, and directed the Division to file additional legal authority and evidentiary 
support.  Post Third Prehearing Conference Order      (unpublished).  On January 30, 2013, the 
Division filed a Supplement to its Motion for Sanctions (Supplement), to which was attached a 
Declaration of Roda Johnson (Johnson Decl.) and the transcript of investigative testimony of 
Edward Cofrancesco (Cofrancesco    Tr.).  
        
                                    FINDINGS OF FACT 
 
       Peak Wealth Opportunities, LLC (Peak Wealth), a Florida limited liability company 
located in Largo, Florida, has been registered with the Commission as an investment adviser 
since October 2007.  OIP, p. 2.  From April 2008 to June 2010, Peak Wealth was the investment 
adviser to StockCar Stocks Index Fund (Fund), the sole series of the StockCar Stocks     Mutual 
Fund, Inc. (Company), formerly a registered investment company.  Id.  Although the Fund 
terminated Peak Wealths advisory agre ement in June 2010, Peak Wealth remains registered 
with the Commission as an investment adviser.  Id., p. 5.  Peak Wealth has not filed a Form ADV 
since September 2008, nor has it filed a Form ADV -W or annually amended Forms ADV for its 
fiscal years ended September 30, 2009, 2010, or 2011.  Id., p. 5; Motion, Exh. 13.  Peak Wealths 
September 2008 Form ADV states that its basis for registration with the Commission is its status 
as an investment adviser to a registered investment company.  Id., p. 5.   Peak Wealth is a wholly 
owned subsidiary of Peak Capital Corporation  (Peak Capital), which also owns Peak Securities 
Corporation, a former broker -dealer (which withdrew its broker-  dealer registration in March 
2010), and a publishing and debt collection business.  Id., p.  2. 
        
       David W. Dube (Dube), age 55, owns Peak Capital and its subsidiary businesses.  OIP, p. 
2.  He is the president and sole managing member of Peak Wealth.     Id.  He was also the acting 
chief compliance officer of the Fund from October 2009 unti l June 2010.  Id.  Dube is a certified 
public accountant licensed in New Hampshire    and, as of December 31, 2012, Florida      .  Id.  ; 
Motion, Exh. 2.   Dube registered with the Public Company Account  ing  Oversight Board in 
January 2010, indicating that he may conduct or  play a substantial role in an audit in the future.  
OIP, p. 2.   A recent public company filing in September 2011 indicates that Dube has been 
engaged to prepare the companys audited financial statements.  Id., p. 2; Motion, Exh. 3, p. 8.  
Other public filings from 2001 and 2002 indicate that Dube has also served on at least two public 
company audit committees.  OIP, p. 2.  Dube has a disciplinary history with the Financial 
Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)     in connection with his formerly registe   red broker -

                                               2

dealer, and has twice had FINRA arbitration awards imposed against him .  Id.; Motion, Exhs. 4 -
6. 
        
       The Company was a Maryland corporation that operated as an open-          end diversified 
management investment company.  OIP, p. 2.  The Company was registe               red with the 
Commission from September 1998 until March 2011, when it formally deregistered.  Id.        The 
Company is now defunct.  Id. 
        
       The Fund was an open-  end management company that invested in companies of the 
StockCars Stocks Index (Index), the Funds pr  oprietary index consisting of approximately 40 
companies that support NASCAR racing events.  OIP, pp.  2-3.  The Fund reported net assets of 
approximately $3.9 million in its most recently filed annual report, for the fiscal year ended 
September 30, 2009.   Id., p. 3.  Edward Cofrancesco (Cofrancesco)      was one of the Funds 
directors.  Cofrancesco Tr., p. 17. 
        
   A.  Peak Wealths Relationship with the Fund 
        
       Peak Wealth became the investment adviser to the Fund in April 2008, pursuant to a vote 
by a majority of the C    ompanys shareholders approving Peak Wealths written advisory 
agreement.  OIP,  p. 3.  The advisory agreement was for an initial term of two years and was 
subject to the Fund boards annual review and approval thereafter.  Id.  Peak Wealth also served 
as t he Funds administrator pursuant to a separate administration agreement.  Id.  Dube    had 
previously done business with Cofrancesco and arranged to have him serve as a director of the 
Fund.  Cofrancesco Tr., pp. 18-19, 24.   
        
       For its advisory services, Peak  Wealth charged an annual fee of 0.65% of the Funds 
average daily net assets.  OIP, p. 3  .  Peak Wealth contractually agreed to waive fees and/or 
reimburse the Fund for all expenses it incurred to the extent necessary to maintain the Funds 
total operating expenses at 1.5% of the Funds average daily net assets for a two-  year period 
ending April 15, 2010.  Id.  Throughout the period of the reimbursement agreement, the expenses 
paid by the Fund, exclusive of advisory fees, exceeded the 1.5% cap.  Id.  This wa     s largely 
because assets under management were low, which in turn was partly the result of poor 
economic conditions and partly the result of poor marketing efforts by Dube and Peak Wealth.  
See Cofrancesco Tr., pp. 59- 61, 65.  Thus, due to the waiver agree  ment, Peak Wealth did not 
collect advisory fees while it served as adviser to the Fund  , and indeed, paid approximately 
$80,000 to the Fund.  OIP, p. 3; Cofrancesco Tr., pp. 87, 129. 
        
       In late 2008, the Funds board began to raise concerns about Peak Wealth     s ability to 
meet its expense reimbursement obligation to the Fund.  OIP, p. 3.  Peak Wealth had failed to 
reimburse the Fund for expenses it owed under the advisory agreement, which resulted in the 
Fund delaying the filing of its annual report for the fis cal year ended September 30, 2008.  Id.; 
Cofrancesco Tr., pp. 51, 54.  By September 2009, the Fund had accumulated another receivable 
for expenses owed from Peak Wealth of approximately $50,000.  OIP, p. 3; Cofrancesco Tr., pp   . 
66, 82.  Dube repeatedly promised the board that he would repay the Fund, but he never did.  
OIP, p. 3.  The Funds auditor refused to release its audit opinion without repayment of the 
outstanding obligation, resulting in the Fund delaying the filing of its 2009 annual report.  Id.; 

                                               3 
 
---------------------Page 4---------------------

Cofrancesco Tr., pp. 90 -91.  Ultimately, the board liquidated Dubes personal holdings in the 
Fund in order to satisfy the outstanding receivable.  OIP, p. 3; Cofrancesco Tr., pp. 90-91. 
        
       The Funds portfolio manager, who worked for Peak Wealth and handle         d the trading 
activity and index rebalancing for the Fund, also encountered problems with Peak Wealth and 
Dube.  OIP, p. 3.  Dube failed to respond to multiple letters and emails from the portfolio 
manager throughout 2008 and 2009 regarding the Funds compliance obligations, the portfolio 
managers concerns about the regularity and substance of his communications with Peak Wealth 
and Dube, and his compensation.   Id., p. 3; Motion, Exh. 7 .  The portfolio manager raised his 
concerns about the lack of communic  ation  directly  with the Funds board.  OIP  ,  p. 3.   The 
portfolio manager was eventually hired and compensated directly by the Fund.  Cofrancesco Tr., 
pp. 44, 101.   
        
       In March 2010, prior to the conclusion of Peak Wealths initial two-     year investment 
advisory agreement with the Fund, the Funds board requested documents from Peak Wealth and 
Dube in connection with its review of Peak Wealths investment advisory contract under Section 
15(c) of the Investment Company Act.  OIP, pp. 3- 4; Motion, Exh. 8; Cofranc  esco Tr., pp. 104-
05.  The board sent a second request in May 2010.  OIP, p. 4; Motion, Exh. 8; Cofrancesco Tr., 
p. 118.  Peak Wealth requested an extension of time to respond to the boards requests but failed 
to provide the board with any of the requeste d documents.  OIP, p. 4; Cofrancesco Tr., pp. 106-
08.  One reason for this failure, according to Dube, was Dubes health problems.  Cofrancesco 
Tr., p. 121.  
        
       In June 2010, the board terminated Peak Wealths advisory agreement, and voted to 
liquidate the Funds assets (approximately $4 million) and to deregister the Company.  OIP, p. 4; 
Cofrancesco Tr., p. 127.  The Fund distributed to investors all remaining assets net of liquidation 
expenses.  OIP, p. 4.  On March 23, 2011, the Commissions Division of Investment 
Management issued an order terminating the Companys registration under the Investment 
Company Act.  Id.  
        
   B.  Examination of Peak Wealth 
        
       In April 2010, Commission staff from the Miami Regional Office initiated an 
examination of Peak Wealth and the Fund.  OIP, p. 4.  The examination staff faxed its initial 
document request list to Peak Wealth and      the  Fund on April 7, 2010, one week before 
commencement of the examination.  Id.  ; Johnson Decl., p. 1.  When the staff arrived on April 14, 
Dube did not have any documents for Peak Wealth or the Fund.  OIP, p. 4; Johnson Decl., p. 1.  
Dube repeatedly assured examiners that responsive documents would be forthcoming.  OIP, p. 4 ; 
Johnson Decl., p. 2.  He frequently assured examiners that his assistant was making copies, but 
she never returned with any.  Johnson Decl., p. 2.   
        
       The examination staff submitted many   additional document requests, follow-up requests, 
and Fail to Produce l etters to Peak Wealth.  OIP,  p. 4; Motion, Exh. 9 ; Johnson Decl., p. 2.  
These incl uded requests for financial records relating to Peak Wealths advisory business, 
including Peak Wealths balance sheet, trial balance, income statement, cash flow statements, 
and cash receipts and disbursements journals.  OIP, p. 4; Motion, Exh. 9.  Dube and Peak Wealth 

                                               4 
 
---------------------Page 5---------------------

did not produce these financial records because they did not exist.  OIP, p. 4.  Instead, Dube told 
examiners that he would create the requested financial records relating to Peak Wealth.  Id., p. 4. 
        
       The examination staff also  submitted a document request to Dube, in his capacity as a 
representative of Peak Wealth and the   Funds acting chief compliance officer, for documents 
relating to the maintenance of the Index, including the list of eligible issuers and proof of their 
eligibility, as well as records of daily value computations, the weighting of positions, the annual 
rebalancing process, and the correlation between the performance of the Fund and the Index.  
OIP, p. 4; Motion, Exh. 10.   
        
       At the conclusion of the field work portion of the      examination, the majority of the 
requests for Peak Wealths financial records remained outstanding, as did requests relating to the 
maintenance of the Index.  OIP, p. 4 ; Johnson Decl., p. 2.  Examination staff referred the matter 
to the Division for further review.  OIP, p. 4.   
        
       The Company, the Fund (through its board), and the former portfolio manager 
subsequently produced documents in response to a subpoena from the enforcement staff.  OIP, p. 
4.  However, Peak Wealth and Dube never responded to the st      affs document subpoenas, and 
Dube failed to appear for investigative testimony pursuant to a subpoena.  Id.; Motion, Exhs. 11-
12.   
        
       During the examination, Dube spoke to Cofrancesco, the only remaining board member 
of the Fund, one time.  Cofrancesco Tr., pp. 111- 12, 122.  Respondents inaction and dearth of 
communication  may  have been because of Dubes       health problems, including a bad skiing 
accident and HIV infection.  Id., pp. 112-13, 133.  In part, however, it was because Dube was 
making money in  other ways, including teaching  overseas.   Id., pp. 66- 67, 122.  In any event, 
Dube represented to the board that the Commission examination was going fabulously well.  
Id., p. 125. 
        
                                  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 
 
       Peak Wealth violated  Section 15(c) of the Investment Co  mpany Act .  That provision 
makes it the duty of an investment adviser of a registered investment company to furnish such 
information as may reasonably be necessary for fund directors to evaluate the terms of any 
contract whereby a person undertakes regular ly to serve or act as investment adviser of such 
company.  15 U.S.C. §   80a-15(c).  The Fund requested documents from Peak Wealth twice, in 
March 2010 and May 2010.  Peak Wealth       requested an extension of time to respond to these 
requests, but ultimately did not furnish the requested documents.   
 
       Peak Wealth violated Section 204 of the Advisers Act and Rules 204      -1(a)(1) and 204-
2(a)(1), (2), (4), (5), and (6) thereunder.  Section 204 of the Advisers Act requires investment 
advisers to make and keep certain records specified by rule, which are subject to examination by 
the Commission.  15 U.S.C. § 80b-  4(a).  Rule 204- 1(a)(1) requires an investment adviser to file a 
Form ADV annually, within  90 days of the end of its fiscal year.  17 C.F.R. §  275.204-1(a)(1).  
Rule 204- 2(a) requires a  registered  investment adviser to make and keep true, accurate, and 

                                               5 
 
---------------------Page 6---------------------

current copies of certain books and records relating to its investment advisory business, 
including: 
 
       -   A journal or journals, including cash receipts and disburseme  nts, records, and any 
           other records of original entry forming the basis of entries in any ledger; 
       -   General and auxiliary ledgers (or other comparable records) reflecting asset, liability, 
           reserve, capital, income and expense accounts; 
       -   All check books, bank statements, cancelled checks and cash reconciliations of the 
           investment adviser; 
       -   All bills or statements (or copies thereof), paid or unpaid, relating to the business of 
           the investment adviser as such; and 
       -   All trial balances, financial statements, and inte rnal audit working papers relating to 
           the business of such investment adviser. 
 
17 C.F.R. § 275.204-2(a)(1), (2), (4), (5), (6).  Peak Wealth did not make and keep many of the 
records requested by the Commissions examination staff in April 2010.  It did not timely      file 
any Forms ADV for its fiscal years ended September 2009, 2010, or 2011.          The examination 
revealed that it did not make and keep, in their entirety, the five categories of books and records 
alleged in the OIP.   
 
       Peak Wealth violated   Section  203A of the Advisers Act and Rule 203A             -1(b)(2) 
thereunder.  Section 203A of the Advisers Act   generally prohibits an  investment adviser from 
registering unless it has assets under management of not less than $25,000,000 or it is an 
investment adviser for a registered investment company.  15 U.S.C. § 80 b-3a(a)(1).  Rule 203A-
1(b)(2) requires a registered investment adviser to file a Form ADV  -W within 180 days of the 
end of its fiscal year if it becomes ineligible for registration.  17 C.F.R. § 275.203A-1(b)(2). 1
                                                                                                    
Peak Wealths most recently filed Form ADV, for the period ended September 30, 2008, stated 

                                                 
1
 This relatively recent regulation, entitled Eligibility for SEC registration; Switching to or from 
SEC registration, is somewhat obscure.  17 C.F.R. § 275.203A     -1 (stating an effective date of 
September 19, 2011).  It has two sections, the second of which is entitled Switching to or from 
SEC registration.  17 C.F.R. § 275.203A      -1(b).  Subsecti on (2), entitled SEC  -registered 
advisers  switching to State registration, reads in pertinent part:  If you are registered with the 
Commission and file an annual updating amendment to your Form ADV reporting that you are 
not eligible for SEC registratio  n . . . you must file Form ADV     -W to withdraw your SEC 
registration within 180 days of your fiscal year end.  17 C.F.R. § 275.203A      -1(b)(2).  Read 
literally, it appears to require the filing of a Form ADV  -W only if ineligibility for  Commission 
registration is reported on an associated annual Form ADV, all for the purpose of switching to 
state registration.  So read, Peak Wealth was under no obligation to file a Form ADV-W, because 
it had not also filed an associated annual Form ADV.  Such a construction is w               holly 
unreasonable, however; surely the duty to file a Form ADV -W is not excused by the failure to 
properly file an annual Form ADV.  Consequently, I interpret Rule 203A        -1(b)(2) to read, in 
effect: If you are registered with the Commission and [are no lon         ger] eligible for SEC 
registration . . . you must file Form ADV -W to withdraw your SEC registration within 180 days 
of your fiscal year end.

that its only basis for registration was its status as investment adviser to a registered investment 
company, a status that ended in June 2010.  Peak Wealth ne         ver filed a Form ADV  -W to 
withdraw its registration. 
 
       Peak Wealths violations are not of anti-fraud provisions, and do not require a showing of 
scienter.  See Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185, 214 (1976) (When a statute speaks so 
specifically i n terms of manipulation and deception, and of implementing devices and 
contrivances . . . we are quite unwilling to extend the scope of the statute to negligent conduct.).  
Where no scienter is required, aiding and abetting liability requires proof that: 1) another party 
has committed a securities law violation; 2) the accused aider and abetter had a general 
awareness that his role was part of an overall activity that was improper; and 3) the accused aider 
and abetter knowingly and substantially assisted t   he principal violation.  Investors Research 
Corp. v. SEC , 628 F.2d 168, 178 (D.C. Cir. 1980).  The knowledge or awareness requirement 
can be satisfied by a finding of recklessness  when the alleged aider and abettor is a fiduciary.  
See Ross v. Bolton, 904 F.2d 819, 824 (2d Cir. 1990)    .  An associated person of an investment 
adviser is a fiduciary to his investment advisory clients.  See Flickinger v. Harold C. Brown, Inc., 
947 F. 2d 595, 599   (2d Cir. 1991).   Recklessness  is highly unreasonable conduct, which 
represents an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care . . . to the extent that the 
danger was either known to the defendant or so obvious that the defendant must have been aware 
of it.  Rolf v. Blyth, Eastman Dillon & Co., 570 F.2d 38, 47 (2d Cir. 1978) (quoting Sanders v. 
John Nuveen & Co., 554 F.2d 790, 793 (7th Cir. 1977)).       A respondent who aids and abets a 
violation  also is a cause of the violation  under the federal securities laws.      See  Sharon M.

222 F.3d 994 (D.C. Cir. 2000)  .    Negligence is sufficient to establish liability for causing a 
primary violation that does not require scienter.  See KPMG Peat Marwick LLP , Exchange Act

affd, 289 F.3d 109 (D.C. Cir. 2002).  
 
       Peak Wealth is controlled by Dube; he is its owner,        president, and sole managing 
member.  He therefore substantially assisted Peak Wealths primary         violations, and was a  
fiduciary to Peak Wealths investment advisory clients .  He   was also at least reckless regarding 
Peak Wealths primary violations, as demonstrated by, for instance,   his request for an extension 
of time to respond to the Funds  Section 15(c) requests, his assurances  to the examination staff 
that he would comply with document requests, and his filing of a Form ADV on behalf of Peak 
Wealth in 2008, one year after initially registering with the Commission     , but not thereafter .  
Therefore, he aided and abetted all of Peak Wealths violations, and also caused them .2

 An associated person may be charged as a primary violator, where the investment adviser is an 
alter ego of the associated person.   John J. Kenny,  Securities Act Release No. 8234 (May 14, 
2003), 56 S.E.C. 448, 485 n.54, affd, 87 F. Appx 608 (8 th

apparently Dubes alter ego, I need not reach this issue because Dube is only char       ged with 
secondary liability.  OIP, pp. 5-6.

                                         SANCTIONS 
        
       The Division requests that I: (1) order Respondents to cease and desist from violating 
Sections 204 and 203A of the Advisers Act , and Rules 203A -1(b)(2), 204-1(a)(1), 204-2(a)(1), 
(2), (4), (5), and (6) thereunder ;3
                                  (2) revoke Peak Wealths investment adviser registration; (3) 
permanently  bar Dube from association with a broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal 
securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, and nationally recognized statistical rating 
organization (NRSRO); (4) permanently      deny Dube the privilege of appearing or practicing 
before the Commission as an accountant; and (5) order Respondents to        pay second-tier civil 
penalties.  Motion at 6-16.   
        
   A.  Willfulness and the Public Interest Factors  
 
       Some of the requested sanctions are only appropriate if Respondents violations were 
willful.  15 U.S.C § 80b-3(e)(5), (6) (revocation of investment adviser registration);   15 U.S.C. § 
80b-3(e)(6),  (f) (associational bar pursuant to the Advisers Act); 17 C.F.R. § 201.102(e)(1)(iii) 
(bar on appearing or practicing before the Commission pursuant to Commission Rule 
102(e)(1)(iii).  A finding of willfulness does not require intent to violate the law, but merely 
intent to do the act which constitutes a violation of the law.    Wonsover v. SEC, 205 F.3d 408, 
414 (D.C. Cir. 2000); Arthur Lipper Corp. v. SEC , 547 F.2d 171, 180 (2d Cir. 1976).   
        
       Where, as here,    the violation s  are  omissions, the y  may be willful    even though 
inadvertent.  Oppenheimer & Co., Exchange Act Release No. 16817 (May 19, 1980), 47 S.E.C. 
286, 288.  Some cases suggest that an omission is willful if a r espondent knew or should have 
known of the required  action.  Id. at 287; Herbert Moskowitz, Initial Decision Release No. 163 
(Apr. 26, 2000), 72 SEC Docket 912, 925.  Other cases state that the failure to make a required 
report, even though inadvertent, constitutes a willful violation,  with no knowledge requirement.  
Robert G. Weeks, Initial Decision Release No.  199 (Feb. 4, 2002), 76  SEC Docket 2609, 2662; 
see also Jesse Rosenblum, Advisers Act Release No. 913 (May 17, 1984), 47 S.E.C. 1065, 1067 
(failure to file form required by Section 204 of Advisers Act and Rule 204-    1 thereunder held 
willful), affd, 760 F.2d 260 (3d Cir. 1985); Amaroq Asset Management, LLC      , Initial Decision 
Release No. 351 (Jul. 14, 2008), 93 SEC Docket 7932, 7943 (failure to file amended Form ADV 
held willful). 

       For the reasons explained above  regarding aiding and abetti ng, Dube knew      or should 
have known of the requirements to respond to the Funds Section 15(c) requests, comply with the 
examination staffs document requests, and file a Form ADV      -W.  Thus, whether or not the 
knew or should have known standard is applicable here, it is satisfied.  Respondents violations 
were therefore willful.

 The Division does not cite to the Investment Company Act in arguing for a cease-      and-desist 
order, and therefore no such order will be entered under that Act.  Motion, p. 6.

       When considering whether an administrative sanction serves the public          interest, the 
Commission considers the factors identified in Steadman v. SEC   , 603 F.2d 1126, 1140 (5th Cir. 
1979),  affd on other grounds , 450 U.S. 91 (1981)  :  the egregiousness of the respondent     s 
actions, the isolated or recurrent nature of the infraction, the degree of scienter involved, the 
sincerity of the respondents assurances against future violations, the respondents recognition of 
the wrongful nature of his or her conduct, and the likelihood that the respondent   s occupation 
will present opportunities for future violations  (Steadman factors).  Gary M. Kornman, Advisers 
Act Release No. 2840 (Feb. 13, 2009),   95 SEC Docket 14246, 14255,  pet. denied, 592 F.3d 173 
(D.C. Cir. 2010).  The Commission s inquiry into the appropriate  sanction to protect the public 
interest is a flexible one, and no one factor is dispositive.  Id.   

       Respondents conduct wa s not par ticularly egregious.  Admittedly, there is at least a 
likelihood that Respondents overall misfeasance contributed to the failure of the Fund.  
Cofrancesco Tr., pp. 117- 18.  However, this is not alleged in the OIP, nor is the evidence 
supporting this concl usion entirely clear.  What is clear is that Respondents v iolated what are 
essentially only record keeping and reporting statutes and regulations.    

       Respondents violated Section 15(c) of the Investment Company Act only twice, but the 
violations were part o f a course of conduct that involved a notable lack of communication with 
the Fund, as demonstrated by Cofrancescos investigative testimony.  I conclude that this 
violation was recurrent.  Respondents violations of Section 204 of the Advisers Act, and the     
applicable Rules thereunder, w ere plainly recurrent.  Respondents violated Section 203A of the 
Advisers Act, and Rule 203A-1(b)(2) thereunder, only once, and it was therefore isolated. 

       Although I have concluded that Dube aided and abetted Peak Wealths vi            olations 
recklessly, this demonstrates only the lowest degree of scienter.   See David Disner, Exchange 
Act Release No. 38234 (Feb. 4, 1997), 52 S.E.C. 1217, 1222 & n.20; Hollinger v. Titan Capital 
Corp., 914 F.2d 1564, 1568-  69 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 976 (1991) (citing eleven 
circuits holding that recklessness satisfies scienter in Section 10(b) and Rule 10b   -5 actions).  
Because  both Respondents have defaulted, they have offered no assurances against future 
violations and they have shown no recognition of the wrongful nature of their conduct.  Dubes 
occupation and Peak Wealths registration present opportunities for future violations.   

       Although I consider each form of requested relief individually below, I place 
considerable weight on the s  trikingly recurrent nature of Respondents infractions, and on 
Respondents opportunities for future violations in light of their occupation and registration 
status.  On balance, t he public interest factors generally weigh in favor of the requested 
sanctions.   

   B.  Cease-and-Desist Order 
        
       Section 203(k) of the Advisers Act authorizes the Commission to impose a cease       -and-
desist order on any person who is violating, has violated, or is about to violate any provision of 
the Advisers Act or rules thereunder.  15 U.S.C. § 80b-3(k).  The Commission may also impose a 
cease-and-desist order against any person that is, was, or would be a cause of the violation, due 
to an act or omission the person knew or should have known would contribute to such violation.  

                                                9 
 
---------------------Page 10---------------------

Id.  Wh ile some likelihood of future violation must be present, the required showing is 
significantly less than that required for an injunction.  KPMG Peat Marwick LLP   , 54 S.E.C. at 
1183-91.  Indeed, absent evidence to the contrary, a single past violation ordi narily suffices to 
establish a risk of future violations.  Id. at 1191.  In evaluating the propriety of a cease-and-desist 
order, the Commission considers the   Steadman factors, as well as the recency of the violation, 
the resulting degree of harm to investors or the marketplace, and the effect of other sanctions.  Id. 
at 1192. 
        
       Respondents violations of the Advisers Act were, as noted, strikingly recurrent, the 
Steadman  factors  otherwise  weigh in favor of the requested relief   , and the violations were 
relatively recent.  Although there is no demonstrated harm to investors or the marketplace, and 
the other sanctions discussed below are serious, a cease -and-desist order is still warranted under 
the totality of the circumstances.   Accordingly, Respondents will be ordered to cease and desist 
from violating Sections 204 and 203A of the Advisers Act and Rules 204      -1(a)(1), 204-2(a)(1), 
(2), (4), (5), and (6), and 203A-1(b)(2) thereunder. 
        
   C.  Registration Revocation 
        
       Section 203(e) of the Advisers Act authorizes the Com mission to revoke an investment 
advisers registration if it, or any person associated with it, has willfully violated, or willfully 
aided and abetted the violation of, any provision of the Advisers Act, and the revocation is in the 
public interest.  15 U.S.C. § 80b-3(e)(5), (6).   Based on the Steadman  factors, Peak Wealth has 
no business serving as an investment adviser; it is plainly in the public interest to revoke its 
registration. 
        
   D.  Associational Bar 
        
       Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act  and Section 15(b) (6) of the Exchange Act authorize 
the Commission to   bar a person from association with a broker, dealer, investment adviser, 
municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, and NRSRO, if that person has 
willfully violated, or willfully aide d and abetted the violation of, any provision of the Advisers 
Act, and the bar is in the public interest.  15 U.S.C . § 80b-3(f); 15 U.S.C. § 78o(b)(6)(A).  Based 
on the Steadman   factors, Dube has no business operating or working for an investment adviser, 
or any other member of the securities industry.  Dube will be permanently barred from 
association with an investment adviser.  The Commission has held that the requested collateral 
bars are not imp ermissibly retroactive, and they will be imposed, as well.     John W. Lawton, 
Advisers Act Release No. 3513 (Dec. 13, 2012), 105 SEC Docket 61722, 61737. 
 
   E.  Commission Rule 102(e)(1)(iii) Bar 
        
       Commission Rule 102(e)(1)(iii) allows the Commission to censure or deny, temporarily 
or permanently, the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission to any person 
who has willfully violated, or willfully aided and abetted the violation of, any provision of the 
federal securities laws or the rules and regulations thereunder.  17 C.F.R. § 201.102(e)(1)(iii) .  
The Steadman factors are considered in evaluating any sanction under Commission Rule 102(e).  
Altman v. SEC, 666 F.3d 1322, 1329 (D.C. Cir. 2011).  As with the sanctions discussed above, 

                                               10 
 
---------------------Page 11---------------------

the Steadman factors point directly at the need to permanently bar Dube from   practicing before 
the Commission as an accountant. 
        
   F.  Civil Penalties 
        
       In administrative cease-and-desist proceedings, the Commission is authorized to impose a 
civil monetary penalty if a respondent has violated or caused any violation of the Investment 
Company Act or rules thereunder, or has violated or caused any violation of the Advisers    Act or 
rules thereunder.  15 U.S.C. §  80a-9(d)(1)(B); 15 U.S.C   § 80b-3(i)(1)(B).  A three  -tier system 
identifies the maximum amount of a civil penalty.  15 U.S.C. §      80a-9(d)(2); 15 U.S.C § 80b-
3(i)(2).  Respondent s violative conduct occurred in 2010 and 2011, except for the failure to 
timely file the Form ADV for the fiscal year ending September 2009, which was due December 
29, 2009.  F or each act or omission by a natural  person in that period, the maximum penalty in 
the first tier is $ 7,500; in the second tier, $75,000; and in the third tier, $150,000.4
                                                                                       15 U.S.C. § 
80a-9(d)(2); 15 U.S.C § 80b- 3(i)(2).  A first -tier penalty is imposed for each statutory violation.  
15 U.S.C. § 80a-9(d)(2)(A); 15 U.S.C § 80b- 3(i)(2)(A).   A second-tier penalty is permissible 
where the conduct involves fraud, deceit, manipulation, or deliberate or reckless disregard of a 
regulatory requirement.  15 U.S.C. §   80a-9(d)(2)(B); 15 U.S.C § 80b- 3(i)(2)(B).  A third   -tier 
penalty involves conduct where such state of mind is present and where the conduct directly or 
indirectly (i) resulted in substantial losses, (ii) created a significant risk of substantial losses to 
other persons, or (iii) resulted in  substantial pecuniary gain to the person who committed the act 
or omission.  15 U.S.C. § 80a-9(d)(2)(C); 15 U.S.C § 80b-3(i)(2)(C). 
        
       The Commission must also find that such a penalty is in the public interest.  15 U.S.C. §   
80a-9(d)(3); 15 U.S.C § 80b-  3(i)(3).  Six factors (not the Steadman   factors) are relevant:  (1) 
whether the violation involved fraud, deceit, manipulation, or deliberate or reckless disregard of 
a regulatory requirement, (2) the resulting harm to other persons, (3) any unjust enrichment and 
prior restitution, (4) the respondents prior regulatory record, (5) the need to deter the respondent 
and other persons, and (6) such other matters as justice may require.  15 U.S.C. § 80a-9(d)(3); 15 
U.S.C § 80b-3(i)(3).  Not all factors may be relevant in a given case, and the factors need not all 
carry equal weight.   See Robert G. Weeks , 76 SEC Docket at  2671.   To impose second- tier 
penalties, the Commission must determine how many violations occurred and how many 
violations are attributable to each person.  Rapoport v. SEC , 682 F.3d 98, 108 (D.C. Cir. 2012). 
        
       As explained above, Respondents omissions involved recklessness, that is, reckless 
disregard for their various legal and regulatory obligations.  Thus, the threshold requirement for 
second-tier penalties has been met.  However, under the totality of the circumstances and 
particularly in light of the statutory public interest factors, I conclude that no civil penalty is 
warranted. 
        
       As noted, the violations involved reckless disregard of a reg  ulatory requirement.  Also, 
Dube has a FINRA disciplinary record and has been the subject of two FINRA arbitration 

                                                 
4
  These amounts reflect inflationar     y adjustments, as required by the Debt Collection 
Improvement Act of 1996, as of      March  3,  2009,  prior to the time Respondents began their 
violative conduct.  See 17 C.F.R. § 201.1004. 
                                                11

awards.  However, there has been no demonstrated resulting harm to other persons              and 
Respondents were not unjustly enriched  quite the opposite, in fact.  These four factors roughly 
balance each other. 
        
       The remaining two factors are, in my view, the weightiest.  Although a civil penalty of 
any amount will have a deterrent effect on Respondents and on other persons, I am not 
convinced that a civil penalty is needed to deter anyone in light of the specific facts of this case.  
In simple terms, Respondents failed to comply with reporting and record keeping requirements, 
nothing more.  In light of the other sanctions imposed against Respondents, a civil penalty is 
entirely unnecessary to deter Respondents, or any other investment adviser or accountant, from 
committing such violations in the future.  Revocation of registration, an associational bar, and 
revocation of the privilege of practicing befor  e the Commission, collectively, are   more than 
sufficient to deter anyone from committing the violations proven in this case. 
        
       Additionally, as another matter under the sixth, catch-  all factor, Dubes health weighs 
against a civil penalty.  An important que  stion, left unanswered by the record in this case, is 
exactly why Respondents failed to meet their legal and regulatory obligations.  All they had to do 
to avoid any sanction at all was simply keep proper records, furnish them to persons entitled to 
them, and file a few Commission forms.  Their violations were entirely of omission rather than 
commission, and the record is utterly silent as to any explanation.  There is some evidence that 
Dube may have neglected the Fund and Peak Wealth because he was making   money teaching.  
Cofrancesco Tr., pp. 66- 67, 122.  However, it is at least as likely that Dubes omissions were 
primarily the result of potentially serious health problems.  Id., pp. 112-113, 133.  If the latter, 
such health problems are a significant mit igating factor.  Taken together with the overdeterrence 
presented by a civil penalty, and in view of the other public interest factors and the totality of the 
circumstances, a civil penalty is not appropriate. 
                                                 
                                            ORDER 
                                                 
       IT IS ORDERED, pursuant to Section 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, 
that Peak Wealth Opportunities, LLC and David W. Dube, CPA, CEASE AND DESIST from 
committing or causing any violations, or any future violations, of Sections 204 and 203A of the 
Investment Advisers Act and Rules 204- 1(a)(1), 204-2(a)(1), (2), (4), (5), and (6),   and 203A-
1(b)(2) thereunder;  
        
       IT IS FURTHER     ORDERED, pursuant to Section 203(e) of the Investment Advisers Act 
of 1940, that the investment adviser registration of Peak Wealth Opportunities, LLC is 
REVOKED; 
        
       IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, pursuant to Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act 
of 1940, that David W. Dube, CPA,    is barred from association with brokers, dealers, investment 
advisers, municipal securities dealers, transfer agents,   municipal advisors, and     nationally 
recognized statistical rating organizations;

       IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, pursuant to Rule 102(e)(         1)(iii) of the Commissions Rules 
of Practice,  that David W. Dube, CPA,  is permanently DENIED the privilege of appearing or 
practicing before the Commission. 
        
       Respondents are notified that they may move to set aside the default in this case.  Rule 
155(b) of the Commissions Rules of Practice permits me, at any time prior to the filing of the 
initial decision, and the Commission, at any time,  to set aside a default for good cause, in order 
to prevent injustice and on such conditions as may be appropriate .  17 C.F.R. § 201.155(b).  A 
motion to set aside a default shall be made within a reasonable time, state the reasons for the 
failure to appear or defend, and specify the nature of the proposed defense in the proceeding.  Id.
