                1.      S. W. Hatfield, CPA (“SWH”) is a public accounting firm based in 
Dallas, Texas.  SWH is registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
(“PCAOB”).  Between January 31, 2010 and May 19, 2011, SWH’s license to practice 
public accounting in Texas was expired.  During this period, SWH issued 38 audit reports 
that 21 issuers included in periodic reports and registration statements filed with the 
Commission. 

                2.      Scott W. Hatfield, CPA (“Scott Hatfield”), age 57, resides in Dallas, 
Texas and is the sole proprietor of SWH.  He served as the engagement partner on each of 
SWH’s issuer audits and knowingly signed the firm’s name to each audit report SWH 
issued during the period SWH’s license was expired.  Scott Hatfield has been licensed in 
Texas as a certified public accountant since 1985.  

                 

        B.      FACTS 
 
        1.      In 1994, Scott Hatfield obtained SWH’s initial license to practice as a public 
accounting firm from the Texas State Board of Public Accountancy (“TSBPA”).  He 
annually renewed SWH’s license through January 2009.   
         
                                                           2
        2.      Under Texas’ Public Accountancy Act,        a firm, including a sole 
                                                                 3
proprietorship such as SWH, may not provide attest services        unless it holds a validly-
                    4                                                                           5
issued firm license,  and only a license holder may issue a report on a financial statement.       
Accordingly, an individual licens  e holder may not issue audit reports unless his firm also 
holds a validly- issued firm license.   
         
        3.      In addition, each firm licensed by the TSBPA that performs attest services 
must enroll and participate in a peer review program.  A firm that performs attest services 
only for issuer clients can meet this requirement through the PCAOB inspection process.  
On the other hand, a firm that performs attest services for any non-issuer clients must also 
enroll in a peer review program for review of its non-public company attest work. 
         
        4.      In October 2009, the TSBPA notified Scott Hatfield that SWH’s license had 
not yet been renewed for the upcoming year and would expire on January 31, 2010.  It also 
informed Scott Hatfield that SWH had failed to report the results of a 2006 peer review or 
the results of any other peer review in the subsequent three years.  In or before March 2010,

        See Tex. Occ. Code Ch. 901 (the “Public Accountancy Act”). 
 
3
        The Texas Administrative Code, Rule 501.52(4), defines “Attest service” to include, among other 
things: “an audit or other engagement required by the [TSBPA] to be performed in accordance with the 
auditing standards adopted by the AICPA, PCAOB, or another national or international accountancy 
organization recognized by the [TSBPA].”

        See Tex. Occ. Code § 901.351 (requiring firm licenses).

        See id. § 901.456.

---------------------Page 3---------------------

the TSBPA told Scott Hatfield that he could be sanctioned if he issued audit reports without 
a valid firm license.   
        
       5.      SWH’s license expired on January 31, 2010 and was not renewed until May 
19, 2011.  Scott Hatfield knew that SWH’s license had expired.   
        
       6.      Scott Hatfield successfully renewed SWH’s firm license on May 19, 2011.  
        
       7.      Between January 31, 2010 and May 19, 2011, while SWH’s public 
accounting license was expired, SWH issued 38 audit reports that 21 issuers included in 
periodic reports and registration statements filed with the Commission (see Appendix).   
Scott Hatfield, as SWH’s sole proprietor, consented to the inclusion of SWH’s audit reports 
in these filings.  Issuers relied on SWH’s audit reports to, among other things, issue 
securities.  Scott Hatfield and SWH billed issuers $199,722 in connection with audits 
conducted or completed while SWH’s license was expired. 
        
       8.      SWH’s audit reports were included in public filings by five issuers quoted 
on the OTCBB during the period from January 31, 2010 and May 19, 2011.  The following 
chart summarizes the number of days traded, the average trading volume and the low, high, 
and average close price per these five issuers during this period:

       9.      Scott Hatfield authorized seven issuers to include SWH audit reports in 
registration statements filed with the Commission while SWH’s license was expired.  Six 
issuers filed registration statements on Form 10-12G; however only one, SMSA Kerrville 
Acquisition Corp. (“SMSA Kerrville”), issued securities during the period that SWH’s 
license was expired.  Specifically, on December 15, 2010, SMSA Kerrville issued 9.5 
million shares of restricted, unregistered common stock in exchange for 100% of the 
outstanding common stock of another company.  In August 2010, the sixth issuer, Asia

---------------------Page 4---------------------

Green Agriculture Corp., f/k/a SMSA Palestine Acquisition Corp., (“SMSA Palestine”), 
issued 11,685,617 shares for 100% of the outstanding common stock of Sino Oriental 
Agriculture Group Limited, a BVI corporation.  SMSA Palestine later filed a Form S-1 on 
                                                                                             6
September 20, 2010 and subsequent amendments before going effective on July 15, 2011.          
        
                                           7
               10.     Three other issuers   disclosed issuances of unregistered, restricted 
                                                                                           
common stock for acquisitions and for services while SWH’s firm license was expired.
Their Commission filings indicate that they relied on Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 
1933, as amended, for an exemption from registration and that no underwriter was used in 
related transactions.  A fourth issuer, X-Change Corp., issued securities during the period 
in which SWH’s license was expired to convert or retire outstanding debt and to obtain 
certain intellectual property rights. 

               11.    Under Rule 1-02(a) of Regulation S-X, audit reports must be 
prepared by “an independent public or certified public accountant.”  Rule 2-01(a) of 
Regulation S-X, however, provides that the Commission will not recognize any person 
(including an unincorporated organization like SWH) as either a public accountant or 
certified public accountant who is not in good standing as such under the laws of the place 
of his residence or principal office.  Between January 31, 2010 and May 19, 2011, SWH 
was not duly registered and in good standing under the laws of the state of Texas, where 
Scott Hatfield resided and SWH maintained its principal office.  Accordingly, SWH was 
not recognized as an accountant by the Commission during this period. 

       C.      VIOLATIONS 
 
               1.      As a result of the conduct described above, Respondents willfully 
violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder, which prohibit 
fraudulent conduct in connection with the purchase or sale of securities. 
        
               2.      As a result of the conduct described above, Respondents do not 
possess the requisite qualifications to represent others, pursuant to Section 4C(a)(1) and Rule 
102(e)(1)(i) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice. 
 
               3.      As a result of the conduct described above, Respondents willfully 
violated the federal securities laws, pursuant to Section 4C(a)(3) of the Exchange Act and 
Rule 102(e)(1)(iii) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice.  
 

                                                 
6
        SMSA Palestine included SWH’s audit report in amendments to the registration statement on form 
S-1 filed November 5, 2010 and December 10, 2010.  Neither the initial registration statement on Form S-1 
filed on September 20, 2010 nor amendments filed subsequent to 2010 include SWH’s audit report.

                                            III. 
        
       In view of the allegations made by the Division of Enforcement, the Commission 
deems it necessary that public administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings be instituted 
to determine: 
        
       A.      Whether  the  allegations  set  forth  in  Section  II  hereof  are  true  and,  in 
connection therewith, to afford Respondents an opportunity to establish any defenses to such 
allegations;  
 
       B.      Whether, pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Respondents 
should be ordered to cease and desist from committing or causing any violation and any 
future violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder;  

       C.      Whether, pursuant to Section 4C of the Exchange Act and Rule 102(e) of the 
Commission’s Rules of Practice, Respondents should be censured or denied, temporarily or 
permanently, the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission as accountants;  
        
       D.      Whether, pursuant to Section 21B of the Exchange Act, civil penalties should 
be levied against either Respondent; and 
        
       E.      Whether, pursuant to Section 21C(e) of the Exchange Act, Respondents should 
be subject to disgorgement with prejudgment interest. 
        
        
                                            IV. 
        
       IT IS ORDERED that a public hearing for the purpose of taking evidence on the 
questions set forth in Section III hereof shall be convened not earlier than 30 days and not 
later than 60 days from service of this Order at a time and place to be fixed, and before an 
Administrative Law Judge to be designated by further order as provided by Rule 110 of the 
Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.110.   
        
       IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent shall file an Answer to the allegations 
contained in this Order within twenty (20) days after service of this Order, as provided by 
Rule 220 of the Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.220.  
        
       If Respondent fails to file the directed answer, or fails to appear at a hearing after 
being duly notified, the Respondent may be deemed in default and the proceedings may be 
determined against him upon consideration of this Order, the allegations of which may be 
deemed to be true as provided by Rules 155(a), 220(f), 221(f) and 310 of the Commission's 
Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R.  §§ 201.155(a), 201.220(f), 201.221(f) and 201.310. 
        
       This Order shall be served forthwith upon Respondent personally or by certified 
mail.

---------------------Page 6---------------------

       IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Administrative Law Judge shall issue an 
initial decision no later than 300 days from the date of service of this Order, pursuant to 
Rule 360(a)(2) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice.  
        
       In the absence of an appropriate waiver, no officer or employee of the Commission 
engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions in this or any factually 
related proceeding will be permitted to participate or advise in the decision of this matter, 
except as witness or counsel in proceedings held pursuant to notice.  Since this proceeding is 
not “rule making” within the meaning of Section 551 of the Administrative Procedure Act, it 
is not deemed subject to the provisions of Section 553 delaying the effective date of any 
final Commission action.
