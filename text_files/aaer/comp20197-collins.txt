                     UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  

                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO  


SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE 
COMMISSION 

                          Plain tiff, 
                                                      Civil Action No. 
             v. 

ILONA KAY COLLINS, 

                          Defendant. 

                                 COMPLAINT 

      Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") alleges: 

                                  SUMMARY 

       1.    In the thrd  quarter of 2003, Quovadx, Inc. ("Quovadx" or the 

"Company"), a Colorado-based software company, fraudulently recognized 

approximately $380,000 in revenue from three purported sales of software licenses to 

MicroStar, Inc. ("MicroStar"), an Ohio company that sells software licenses and 

maintenance services to the healthcare industry. In fact, these purported sales were 

parking arrangements designed to accelerate revenue recognition for Quovadx from 

transactions that Quovadx was in the process of negotiating with other customers but had 

been unable to finalize before the end of the quarter. MicroStar had neither the ability 

nor the intent to pay for the licenses unless and until Quovadx found customers to buy the 

licenses. As a result, Quovadx improperly recognized approximately $380,000 in 

revenue fiom the purported sales to MicroStar and materially overstated its software 

licensing revenue by approximately 14% for the third quarter of 2003. 
---------------------Page 2---------------------

       2.     Defendant Ilona Kay Collins ("Collins") was Quovadx's Controller during 

the relevant time, and she reported directly to Quovadx's Chef  Financial Officer. 

Collins approved the recognition of revenue from the third quarter 2003 MicroStar 

transactions when she knew or was reckless in not knowing that MicroStar was merely 

holding the software until it was resold to other customers the next quarter, and that there 

was no likelihood of otherwise collecting those revenues fiom MicroStar. In February 

2004, after one of the customers refused to buy fi-om MicroStar and bought fiom 

Quovadx instead, Collins participated in a plan to channel payment fiom that Quovadx 

customer to MicroStar, which created the false appearance that Quovadx had collected 

part of the MicroStar revenue. Collins also signed a management representation letter for 

2003 sent to Quovadx's outside auditor that failed to disclose the true facts and 

circumstances of the MicroStar transactions. 

       3.     By the conduct described below, Collins violated, or aided and abetted 

violations of the antifraud, reporting, books and records, and internal controls pr&isions 

of the federal securities laws. Unless enjoined by order of this Court, Collins is likely to 

commit such violations in the future. The Commission seeks a judgment permanently 

enjoining the defendant from further securities law violations and imposing an officer and 

director bar and a civil money penalty. 

                                   JURISDICTON 

       4.     This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Section 22 of the Securities Act of 

1933 ("Securities Act") [15 U.S.C. $77v(a)] and Sections 21 and 27 of the Securities 

Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") [15 U.S.C. $$78u and 78aal. 
---------------------Page 3---------------------

       5.     Collins, directly or indirectly, made use of the means or instrumentalities 

of interstate commerce, or of the mails, in connection with the transactions, acts, 

practices, and courses of business described in this Complaint, certain of which have 

occurred within this judicial district. 

                                THE DEFENDANT 

       6.     While employed by Quovadx, Collins, age 44, resided in Denver, 

Colorado. She was Controller at Quovadx from approximately November 2000 until 

April 2004, at which time she left Quovadx. 

                               RELATED ENTITY 

       7.     Quovadx, a Delaware corporation headquartered in Englewood, Colorado, 

is a software company that licenses software and sells related services to the healthcare 

industry. At all relevant times, Quovadx's stock was registered with the Commission 

under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and traded on the NASDAQ. During 2002 and 

2003, Quovadx derived about one-third of its reported revenue from software licensing 

fees, with the rest coming from software maintenance and service contracts. Quovadx 

separately reported its software licensing revenue, which included sales of both software 

and licenses. During the relevant period, Quovadx had a continuously effective offering 

of securities pursuant to Form S-8. It also registered an offer of securities pursuant to 

Form S-4 in the fourth quarter of 2003. 

                   RELEVANT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 

       8.     As a public company, Quovadx was required to file quarterly and annual 

reports with the Commission that presented its financial results in conformity with 

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"). The American Institute of 
---------------------Page 4---------------------

Certified Public Accountants' Statement of Position 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition 

("SOP 97-2") and related interpretations are the principal GAAP provisions governing 

the recognition of revenue for sales of software and software licenses. 

       9.     Under SOP 97-2, a company may not recognize revenue from a software 

license sale unless and until there is: persuasive evidence of an arrangement; delivery of 

the software; a fixed or determinable seller's fee; and a reasonable probability of 

collecting the accounts receivable. Further, if payment is substantially contingent on the 

buyer's success in distributing the product to the customer, either due to the terms of the 

deal or because the buyer is so undercapitalized that it cannot pay until it sells the 

product, the seller may not recognize the software license revenue at the time of sale. In 

its financial reports filed with the Commission, Quovadx claimed that it had recognized 

revenue in accordance with GAAP. 

                            FACTUAL     ALLEGATIONS 

       10.    In late September 2003, Collins learned that Quovadx's sales force would 

be unable to complete negotiations by the end of the thrd  quarter with three of its 

customers for the sale of software licenses. She also learned that, in order to nonetheless 

record the nearly-completed sales in the third quarter, Quovadx's sales force had reached 

three agreements with MicroStar, a small, Ohio-based software integrator, to hold the 

licenses until the intended customers would buy the licenses from MicroStar in the fourth 

quarter. Collins approved Quovadx's recognition of about $380,000 in revenue in the 

third quarter of 2003 from these transactions with MicroStar. Collins approved this 

revenue recognition despite the fact that she knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that 
---------------------Page 5---------------------

MicroStarys payment to Quovadx was contingent on Quovadx delivering customers to 

purchase the software from MicroStar in the fourth quarter. 

       11.    In addition, Collins took no steps to determine whether MicroStar had the 

ability to pay for the software licenses. MicroStar, in fact, had no ability to pay for the 

licenses other than by reselling them to the customers with whom Quovadx had been 

negotiating. Further, MicroStar had no reasonable ability to find alternative customers, 

absent Quovadx's assistance. 

       12.    Shortly after Quovadx filed its quarterly report for the third quarter of 

2003, Collins learned that MicroStar had not paid for any of the software licenses 

because the anticipated customers had declined to buy them from MicroStar. Collins did 

not direct Quovadx employees to reverse the MicroStar revenue. Instead, with her 

knowledge and approval, Quovadx's sales staff began to look for alternative customers to 

buy the software licenses from MicroStar. These efforts ultimately failed. 

       13.    By November 2003, it appeared that the intended customers might not buy 

the software that MicroStar had been holding. However, in December 2003, one of the 

intended customers ("the U.K. customer") purchased different software licenses for 

approximately $257,000 from a Quovadx subsidiary in the United Kingdom. Quovadx's 

then-Executive Vice President of Sales, its then-Chief Financial Officer, and Collins 

determined that they would have the payment from the U.K. customer channeled through 

MicroStar to Quovadx. When the U.K. customer made the payment in February 2004 to 

Quovadx's U.K. subsidiary, the U.K. subsidiary reversed the transaction from its books at 

Collins7 direction and sent approximately $257,000 to Quovadx's U.S. offices. Then, 

with Collins' knowledge and participation, Quovadx wired this money to MicroStar on 
---------------------Page 6---------------------

February 4,2004.  On February 6,2004, MicroStar wired back $247,000 to Quovadx, 

keeping $10,000 as payment for holding the licenses for Quovadx. By channeling the 

payment through MicroStar, Quovadx created the false impression that MicroStar had 

made a substantial payment for the software it was holding and that MicroStar had the 

ability to pay the balance. At Collins' direction, Quovadx's employees continued to 

search for additional opportunities to channel software license sales to MicroStar to 

eliminate the remaining balance. 

       14.    On or about February 10,2004, in conjunction with the audit of Quovadx's 

annual report for 2003, Quovadx's then-Chief Executive Officer, Quovadx's then-Chief 

Financial Officer, and Collins signed a management representation letter to Quovadx's 

auditor. The letter represented that Quovadx's financial statements were prepared in 

conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. This representation was false 

and misleading with regard to the revenue reported for the MicroStar transactions because 

MicroStar had been holding the licenses for Quovadx to resell to other customers and there 

was no likelihood that MicroStar could otherwise pay for them. 

       15.    In August 2004, after Collins ceased working at Quovadx, Quovadx 

reversed all three of the software license sales to MicroStar. 

                           FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF  

  Violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. tj 77q(a)] and Section  

10(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. tj 78j(b)] and Rule lob-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R.  

                                    5 240.10b-51 


       16.    The Commission realleges and incorporates herein by reference paragraphs 1 

through 15 above. 

       17.    Section 17(a) of the Securities Act prohibits a person fi-om engaging in any 

transaction, practice, or course of business which would operate as a fi-aud or deceit upon a 
---------------------Page 7---------------------

purchaser in the offer or sale of any securities. One of the ways a person violates Section 

17(a) is to engage in transactions, practices or courses of business that result in materially 

false or misleading statements or material omissions in Commission filings or in other 

statements disseminated to investors. Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule lob-5 

thereunder prohibit materially false or misleading statements or omissions made in 

connection with the purchase or sale of securities. 

       18.    Collins approved the recognition of revenue fiom the third quarter 2003 

MicroStar transactions knowing, or recklessly disregarding, that MicroStar was merely 

holding the licenses for Quovadx to resell to other customers and there was no likelihood 

that Quovadx would otherwise collect the revenue. Further, in February 2004, Collins 

knowingly or recklessly participated in a plan to channel an unrelated payment fiom another 

Quovadx customer to MicroStar which then used those funds to make a payment to 

Quovadx, creating a false appearance that MicroStar made a substantial payment and had 

the ability to pay the balance. 

       19.    By engaging in the conduct described above, Collins knowingly or 

recklessly violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange 

Act and Rule lob-5 thereunder. 

                          SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF  

  Violation of Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2,  

    thereunder [15 U.S.C.  5 78m(b)(5), 17 C.F.R. $5 240.13b2-1 and 240.13b2-21  


       20.    The Commission realleges and incorporates herein by reference paragraphs 1 

through 15 above. 

       21.    Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act prohibits any person fiom 

knowingly circumventing or knowingly failing to implement a system of internal 
---------------------Page 8---------------------

accounting controls or knowingly falsifying any book, record or account. 

       22.    Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 prohibits any person from directly or indirectly 

falsifying or causing to be falsified, any book, record or account subject to Section 

13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act. 

       23.    Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2 prohibits any director or officer of an issuer fi-om 

directly or indirectly makmg or causing to be made misleading statements to an accountant 

in connection with an audit. 

       24.    In February 2004, Collins participated in a plan to channel payment from 

another Quovadx customer to MicroStar, which created the false appearance that Quovadx 

had collected part of the MicroStar revenue. 

       25.    Collins also made materially false or misleading statements and omitted to 

disclose material information to Quovadx's auditor in the management representation letter 

she signed on February 10,2004. Contrary to her representations in that letter, Collins knew 

or recklessly disregarded the facts that: (1) a substantial portion of the MicroStar receivable 

had been paid with proceeds fkom an unrelated transaction; and (2) any further payment 

fi-om MicroStar depended upon Quovadx identifying customers to purchase the software 

licenses fkom MicroStar. 

       26.    By reason of the foregoing, Collins therefore violated Section 13(b)(5) and 

Exchange Act Rules 13b2- 1 and 13b2-2, thereunder. 

                           THIRD   CLAIM FOR RELIEF  

    Aiding and Abetting Violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C.  

       8 78m(a)] and Rules 12b-20,13a-11 and 13a-13 [17 C.F.R   55 240.12b-20, 

                                 13a-11 and 13a-131  


       27.    The Commission realleges and incorporates herein by reference paragraphs 1 

through 15 above. 
---------------------Page 9---------------------

       28.    Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-11 and 13a-13 

thereunder require that issuers with securities registered under Section 12 of the 

Exchange Act, such as Quovadx, file periodic reports with the Commission that are 

complete and accurate in all material respects. Exchange Act Rule 12b-20 requires that, in 

addition to the information expressly required to be included in a statement or report, an 

issuer must add such Mer  material information, if any, as may be necessary to make the 

required statements, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not 

misleading. 

       29.    Quovadx materially overstated its software licensing revenue in the third 

quarter of 2003 by improperly recognizing revenue from the three purported sales of 

software licenses to MicroStar. As a result, Quovadx's quarterly report for the third 

quarter of 2003 and the earning release attached to its Form 8-K for that quarter 

contained materially inaccurate and misleading statements. By improperly approving the 

recognition of revenue from the MicroStar parking arrangements, Collins knowingly 

provided substantial assistance to Quovadx in its violations of Section 13(a) of the 

Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-11 and 13a- 13 thereunder. 

       30.    By reason of the foregoing, Collins aided and abetted Quovadx's 

violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-11 and 13a- 13 

thereunder 

                         FOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF  

       Aiding and Abetting Violations of Sections 13@)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B)  

         of the Exchange Act  115 U.S.C. $5 78m@)(2)(A) and 78m@)(2)(B)]  


       3 1.   The Commission realleges and incorporates herein by reference paragraphs 1 

through 15 above. 
---------------------Page 10---------------------

       32.    Section 13@)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act requires that issuers with securities 

registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, such as Quovadx, make and keep books, 

records, and accounts that accurately and fairly represent the transactions of the company. 

Section 13@)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act requires that issuers devise and maintain systems 

of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that, among other 

thgs,  transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in 

conformance with GAAP   and to maintain accountability of assets. 

       33.    Quovadx's books and records were materially inaccurate during the relevant 

period because they overstated software licensing revenue and did not accurately or fairly 

reflect the transactions of the company. Quovadx also failed to maintain internal controls 

sufficient to ensure that revenue recognition would occur properly and that its financial 

statements would be prepared in conformance with GAAP.  Accordingly, Quovadx violated 

Sections 13@)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act. 

       34.    By improperly approving the recognition of revenue fiom the MicroStar 

parking arrangements for the third quarter of 2003 and channeling an unrelated payment 

through MicroStar in February 2004 that made it appear that MicroStar had partially paid 

for the licenses, Collins knowingly provided substantial assistance to Quovadx in its 

violations of Sections 13@)(2)(A) and 13@)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act. 

       35.    By reason of the foregoing, Collins aided and abetted Quovadx's violations 

of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13@)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act.
