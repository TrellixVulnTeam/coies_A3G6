       In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondents have submitted an Offer

       On the basis of this Order and Respondents’ Offer, the Commission finds3
                                                                                that: 

A.     RESPONDENTS 

       1.       Reed & Taylor, CPAs, P.C. (the “Firm”) is a Michigan professional corporation 
and a public accounting firm headquartered in Detroit, Michigan.  The Firm audited Buckeye 
Ventures, Inc.’s (“Buckeye Ventures”) financial statements for the company’s 2003 fiscal year 
ended December 31, 2003.  Buckeye Ventures dismissed the Firm as its independent auditor on 
January 20, 2005. 

       2.       Robert E. Reed, CPA, (“Reed”), 54, of Detroit, Michigan, is a certified public 
accountant licensed in the state of Michigan.  Reed was the engagement partner in connection with 
the Firm’s audit of Buckeye Ventures’s financial statements for the company’s 2003 fiscal year 
ended December 31, 2003. 

B.     FACTS 

       1.     Buckeye Ventures (known as World Wide Motion Pictures Corporation during the 
relevant period) is a Michigan corporation with its headquarters in San Diego, California.  Buckeye 
Ventures’s common stock is registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the 
Exchange Act and trades on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol BEYV.  For its fiscal year 
ended December 31, 2003, Buckeye Ventures reported revenues of $16,300 and total assets of 
approximately $11 million. 

       2.     Buckeye Ventures has at all relevant times been an issuer as defined by the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Act”). 

       3.     The Firm audited Buckeye Ventures’s 2003 financial statements included in 
Buckeye Ventures’s annual report for fiscal year 2003 on Form 10-KSB, filed with the 
Commission on March 23, 2004.  As part of that audit, the Firm prepared and issued an audit 

3 
       The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondents’ Offer of Settlement and are not binding on any 
other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

report dated March 12, 2004 (the “Buckeye Ventures audit report”), which the company included 
in its 2003 Form 10-KSB.  Buckeye Ventures paid the Firm $500 for the audit work.        4 

        4.      At the time the Firm issued the Buckeye Ventures audit report, it was not registered 
with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the “Board”), as required by Section 
102(a) of the Act. 

        5.      Reed was the engagement partner on the Firm’s audit of Buckeye Ventures’s 2003 
financial statements.  Reed participated in the preparation and issuance of the Buckeye Ventures 
audit report. 

C.      VIOLATIONS 

        1.      Section 102(a) of the Act provides that “it shall be unlawful for any person that is 
not a registered public accounting firm to prepare or issue, or to participate in the preparation or 
issuance of, any audit report with respect to any issuer.”5 

        2.      The provisions of Section 102(a) of the Act became effective on October 22, 2003.      6 

        3.      Based on the conduct described above, the Firm willfully    7
                                                                              violated Section 102(a) 
of the Act. 

        4.      Based on the conduct described above, Reed caused the Firm’s violation of Section 
102(a) of the Act. 

D. FINDI       NGS 

        Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that the Firm willfully violated Section 
102(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and that Reed caused the Firm’s violation of Section 
102(a) of the Act. 

4 
        During the course of the Commission’s investigation, the Firm voluntarily reimbursed Buckeye Ventures 
the $500 in audit fees.  In view of the Firm’s reimbursement, the Commission is not ordering disgorgement in this 
matter. 
5 
        A violation of the Act or any rule that the Board issues under the Act is treated for all purposes in the same 
manner as a violation of the Exchange Act, including with respect to penalties.  Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 15 
U.S.C.A. § 7202(b)(1) (West 2002). 
6 
        Section 102(a) became effective “[b]eginning 180 days after the date of the determination of the 
Commission under Section 101(d)” of the Act that the Board was prepared to undertake its statutory responsibilities.  
The Commission made the required determination on April 25, 2003.  See Order Regarding Section 101(d) of the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Securities Act Release No. 8223, Exchange Act Release No. 47746, 2003 WL 
1956164  (Apr. 25, 2003). 
7 
        “Willfully” as used in this Order means intentionally committing the act that constitutes the violation. 
There is no requirement that the actor also be aware that he is violating a rule or statute.  See Wonsover v. SEC, 205 
F.3d 408, 414 (D.C. Cir. 2000); Tager v. SEC, 344 F.2d 5, 8 (2d Cir. 1965).
