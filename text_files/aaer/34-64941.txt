                                                  I. 
 
       The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) deems it appropriate and in the 
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against John N. 
Irwin, CPA (Respondent or Irwin) pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(i) of the Commissions Rules of 
Practice.1
            
                                                   

                                                 
1
 Rule 102(e)(3)(i) provides, in relevant part, that: 
 
              The Commission, with due regard to the public interest and without preliminary hearing, 
may, by order, . . . suspend from appearing or practicing before it any . . . accountant . . . who has 
been by name . . . permanently enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction, by reason of his 
or her misconduct in an action brought by the Commission, from violating or aiding and abetting 
the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or of the rules and regulations 
thereunder.

                                               II. 
 
       In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the Offer) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the 
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings 
herein, except as to the Commissions jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these 
proceedings, and the findings contained in Section III.2. below, which are admitted, Respondent 
consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Rule 102(e) 
of the Commissions Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions 
(Order), as set forth below.   
 
                                              III. 
 
       On the basis of this Order and Respondents Offer, the Commission finds that:  
 
              1.      Irwin, age 73, is and has been a certified public accountant licensed to 
practice in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.   

              2.      On July 12, 2011, a judgment was entered against Irwin, permanently 
enjoining him from future violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 
1933, and granting other relief, in the civil action entitled SEC v. John N. Irwin, et al., Civil Action 
Number 11-CV-4429 (PD), in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of 
Pennsylvania.   

              3.      The Commissions complaint (the Irwin Complaint) alleged that Irwin 
made materially false and misleading statements to investors in connection with a Ponzi scheme 
orchestrated by Joseph Forte (Forte).  From 1995 through 2008, Forte operated a Ponzi scheme 
through Forte, LP (the Fund), a limited partnership he established with Irwins assistance.  The 
Ponzi scheme ended in January 2009 following the Commissions filing of an emergency action, 
SEC v. Forte, et al., Civil Action Number 2:09-cv-00063-PD (filed Jan. 7, 2009), charging Forte 
and the Fund with fraudulently raising over $50 million from approximately 80 investors.   

              4.      The Irwin Complaint alleged that, in connection with the scheme, Irwin 
made materially false and misleading statements to existing and potential investors about, among 
other things, the Funds current value and growth, historical positive performance, and 
conservative trading strategy.  In addition, the Irwin Complaint alleged that Irwin failed to disclose 
to investors that he was receiving a percentage of Fortes fees as compensation for helping to 
establish the Fund.

                                                      IV. 
                                                         
        In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
impose the sanction agreed to in Respondent Irwins Offer. 
 
        Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that: 
 
        Irwin is suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant.   
 
 
        By the Commission. 
 
 
 
                                                                                     Elizabeth M. Murphy 
                                                                                     Secretary 
 

                                                       3
