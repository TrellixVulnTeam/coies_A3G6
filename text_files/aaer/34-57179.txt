Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Act”). 

       3.     Although Respondents were aware of the Public Company Accounting Oversight 
Board (“PCAOB”) registration requirements, at no point did the Firm register with the PCAOB as 
a public accounting firm.

2003).

other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

       7.      Powell and Halt participated in the preparation and issuance of audit reports dated 
August 11, 2004, and October 11, 2004, which were included in American Utilicraft’s Form 10-

       8.      Respondents were aware of the registration requirements and the October 22, 2003 
deadline for registration with the PCAOB when the Firm issued the August 11, 2004 and October 
11, 2004 audit reports. 

       9.      The Firm received $104,797 for conducting an audit of American Utilicraft’s

appearing or practicing before the Commission in any way, if that person is found by the 
Commission … (1) not to possess the requisite qualifications to represent others … or (3) to have 
willfully violated, or willfully aided and abetted the violation of, any provision of the securities 
laws or the rules and regulations issued thereunder.” 

       2.      Rule 102(e)(1) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice provides that the 
Commission “may censure a person or deny, temporarily or permanently, the privilege of 
appearing or practicing before it in any way to any person who is found by the Commission ... (i)

any provision of the Federal securities laws or the rules and regulations thereunder.” 

       3.      Section 102(a) of the Act provides that “it shall be unlawful for any person that is

                                                                           violated Section 102(a) 
of the Act. 

D. FINDI       NGS 

       1.      Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that the Firm, Powell and Halt did

Section 102(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 
       . 
                                                 IV. 

       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in Respondents’ Offer. 

       Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that: 

       1.      Halt, Buzas & Powell, Ltd. 

               A.      The Firm shall cease and desist from committing or causing any violations 
and any future violations of Section 102(a) of the Act. 

               B.      The Firm is denied the privilege of appearing or practicing before the 
Commission as an accountant. 

               C.      After one year from the date of this Order, the Firm may request that the 
Commission consider its reinstatement by submitting an application (attention: Office of the 
Chief Accountant) to resume appearing or practicing before the Commission as: 

                       1.  a preparer or reviewer, or a person responsible for the preparation or 
review, of any public company’s financial statements that are filed with the Commission.  Such 
an application must satisfy the Commission that the Firm’s work in the Firm’s practice before 
the Commission will be reviewed either by the independent audit committee of the public 
company for which the Firm works or in some other acceptable manner, as long as the Firm 
practices before the Commission in this capacity; and/or

       Section 102(a) became effective “[b]eginning 180 days after the date of the determination of the 
Commission under Section 101(d)” of the Act that the PCAOB was prepared to undertake its statutory 
responsibilities.  The Commission made the required determination on April 25, 2003.  See Order Regarding Section 
101(d) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Securities Act of 1933 Release No. 8223, Exchange Act Release No.

F.3d 408, 414 (D.C. Cir. 2000); Tager v. SEC, 344 F.2d 5, 8 (2d Cir. 1965).

Commission that: 

                             (a)  the Firm is registered with the PCAOB in accordance with the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and such registration continues to be effective.  However, if 
registration with the PCAOB is dependent upon reinstatement by the Commission, the 
Commission will consider an application on its other merits; 

                             (b)  the Firm has resolved all disciplinary issues with the PCAOB, 
and has complied with all terms and conditions of any sanctions imposed by the PCAOB (other 
than reinstatement by the Commission); and 

                             (c)  the Firm acknowledges responsibility, as long as the Firm 
appears or practices before the Commission as an independent accountant, to comply with all 
requirements of the Commission and the PCAOB, including, but not limited to, all requirements 
relating to registration, inspections, concurring partner reviews and quality control standards.   

              D.      The Commission will consider an application by the Firm to resume 
appearing or practicing before the Commission provided that the Firm’s state CPA license is 
current and the Firm has resolved all other disciplinary issues with the applicable state boards of 
accountancy.  However, if state licensure is dependent on reinstatement by the Commission, the 
Commission will consider an application on its other merits.  The Commission’s review may 
include consideration of, in addition to the matters referenced above, any other matters relating 
to the Firm’s character, integrity, professional conduct, or qualifications to appear or practice 
before the Commission. 

              E.      IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Halt, Buzas & Powell shall, within 21 
days of the entry of this Order, pay disgorgement of $83,837 and prejudgment interest of $17,874
