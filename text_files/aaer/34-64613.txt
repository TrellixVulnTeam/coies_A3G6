                                               I. 
 
              The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) deems it appropriate and in the 
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against Mark C. 
Schwartzhoff (Respondent or Schwartzhoff) pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(i) of the 
Commissions Rules of Practice.1

                                               II. 
 
              In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the Offer) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the 
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings 
herein, except as to the Commissions jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these 
proceedings, and the findings contained in Section III.3 below, which are admitted, Respondent 
consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Rule 102(e) 
of the Commissions Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions 
(Order), as set forth below.   
 
                                              III. 
 
              On the basis of this Order and Respondents Offer, the Commission finds that:  
 
       1.     Schwartzhoff, age 43, resides in Odessa, Missouri.  From July 1992 to July 1995, he 
worked as an internal auditor for Thor Industries, Inc.s corporate headquarters in Jackson Center, 
Ohio.  From July 1995 to January 2007, he was employed by Dutchmen Manufacturing, Inc. 
(Dutchmen), a Thor operating subsidiary located in Goshen, Indiana.  He served as Dutchmens 
Controller from July 1995 to approximately May 1997.  He served as Dutchmens   Vice President of 
Finance, Dutchmens senior financial officer position, from approximately May 1997 through 
January 2007.  In February 2007, Respondents employment with Dutchmen was terminated 
effective January 19, 2007. 
        
              2.     Thor Industries, Inc. (Thor) is a Delaware corporation based in Jackson Center, Ohio. 
Thor produces and sells a wide range of recreation vehicles and small and mid-size buses in the 
U.S. and Canada.  At all releva  nt times, Thors co mmon stock has been registered with the 
Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) 
and traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol THO.  Dutchmen Manufacturing, 
Inc. is one of Thors principal operating subsidiaries.    
 
       3.           On May 23, 2011, a final judgment was entered against Respondent, permanently 
enjoining him from future violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and 
Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder, and aiding and abetting violations of 
Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-
1, and 13a-13 thereunder, in the civil action entitled Securities and Exchange Commission v. Thor 
Industries Inc., et al., Civil Action Number 1:11-cv-00889 (RMC), in the United States District 
Court for the District of Columbia.   The final judgment also prohibits Respondent from serving as 
an officer or director of any issuer that has a class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of 
the Exchange Act or that is required to file reports pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act.  
In addition, the final judgment orders Respondent to pay disgorgement of $299,805, together with 
prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $95,025, for a total $394,830, but provides that such 

                                               2

amount shall be deemed satisfied upon the entry of an order in a parallel criminal proceeding 
requiring Respondent to pay restitution in an amount equal to or greater than $394,830. 
         
        4. The Commissions complain               t alleged, among other things , that during the second 
quarter of fiscal 2003 through the second quarter of fiscal 2007, Respondent created and recorded 
fraudulent accounting entries and related document ation to hide inventory losses occurring at 
Dutchmen.  Instead of properly recording increased cost of goods sold, Respondent hid inventory 
losses in various balance sheet accounts, incl  uding accounts receivable, accounts payable, and 
cash.  These entries resulted in overstating Dutchmens pretax income by approximately $26 
million during fiscal 2004 to 2006 and into the second quarter of fiscal 2007.  As a result, as 
alleged in the complaint, Thors annual and qua               rterly financial statements filed with the 
Commission during this period were false and misleading.  In                 June 2007, Thor filed restated 
financial statements with the Commission for fis cal years 2004 to 2006 an d the first quarter of 
fiscal 2007.   
         
                                                       IV. 
                                                          
         In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
impose the sanction agreed to in Respondent Schwartzhoff s Offer. 
 
         Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that: 
 
              Schwartzhoff is suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an 
accountant.   
 
 
 By the Commission.
