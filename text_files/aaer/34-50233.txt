       On the basis of this Order and the Respondents Offer, the Commission finds that: 2
 
A. Respondents 
 
       1.     Royal Dutch Petroleum Company 
 
       Royal Dutch is a corporation incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands and 
headquartered in The Hague, Netherlands.  Its stock is registered with the Commission pursuant 
to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and trades on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 
       2.     The Shell Transport and Trading Company, p.l.c. 
 
       Shell Transport is a corporation incorporated under the laws of England and 
headquartered in London, England.  Its Ordinary shares, as well as New York Shares 
representing Ordinary shares of an aggregate nominal amount of ₤1.50 and evidenced by 
Depositary Receipts (New York Shares), are registered with the Commission pursuant to 
Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act.  Its New York Shares trade on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
 
       3.     The Royal Dutch/Shell Group of Companies 
 
       Royal Dutch and Shell Transport do not engage in operational activities.  They derive the 
whole of their respective incomes  except interest income on cash balances or short-term 
investments  from their interests in the collection of companies known as the Royal Dutch/Shell 
Group of Companies (the Group and, collectively with Royal Dutch and Shell Transport, 
Shell).  The Group is organized under two Group holding companies that, directly or 
indirectly, own all of the Group companies.  The parent companies, Royal Dutch and Shell 
Transport, own all of the shares of the two holding companies.  Royal Dutch and Shell Transport 
are entitled to have their respective nominees elected as the members of the boards of directors 
of the holding companies.  The managing directors of the holding companies are, in turn, 
appointed to a joint Committee of Managing Directors (CMD) responsible for considering and 
developing objectives and long-term plans of the Group.  
 
B. Summary 
                                                 
       In a series of announcements between January 9 and May 24, 2004, Shell announced the 
recategorization of 4.47 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe), or approximately 23%, of the 
proved reserves it reported as of year-end 2002, because they did not comply with the

definition of proved reserves in Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X (Rule 4-10).3
                                                                                This 
recategorization reduced the standardized measure of future cash flows reported in Shells 
original 2002 Form 20-F as Supplemental Information under Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standard No. 69 (FAS 69) by approximately $6.6 billion.  On July 2, 2004, Shell filed an 
amended 2002 Form 20-F reflecting the restatement of its proved reserves and standardized 
measure of future cash flows for the years 1999 to 2002 as follows: 
        
                   Reduction in                         Reduction in 
                     Proved                          Standardized

                                                                               N/A

     2000             4.84 boe            25%            $7.2 billion         10% 
     2001             4.53 boe            24%            $6.5 billion         13% 
     2002             4.47 boe            23%            $6.6 billion          9% 
        
 
As a result of the overstatement of proved reserves for 2002 and prior years, Shell also 
announced a reduction in its Reserves Replacement Ratio (RRR) for the five-year period, 1998 
through 2002, from the previously reported 100% to approximately 80%.  Had Shell reported 
proved reserves properly, its annual and three-year RRR over this span would have been as 
follows: 
        
                              1-Year RRR                3-Year RRR

              1999         56%           -5%          n/a          n/a 
              2000         69%           50%         102%          60% 
              2001         74%           97%          66%          48% 
              2002         117%         121%          87%          90% 
              2003          n/a          63%          n/a          94% 
        
       As discussed more fully below, Shells overstatement of proved reserves, and its delay in 
correcting the overstatement, resulted from (i) its desire to create and maintain the appearance of 
a strong RRR, a key performance indicator in the oil and gas industry, (ii) the failure of its 
internal reserves estimation and reporting guidelines to conform to Rule 4-10s requirements, 
and (iii) the lack of effective internal controls over the reserves estimation and reporting 
processes.  These failures led Shell to record and maintain proved reserves it knew (or was 
reckless in not knowing) did not satisfy Rule 4-10s requirements, and to report for certain years 
a stronger RRR than it actually had achieved.  Indeed, Shell was warned on several occasions

 Although Shell estimated the effects of the reserve recategorization on its proved reserves through 1997, its 
restatement of its FAS 69 standardized measure of future cash flows extended only through 1999.

prior to the Fall of 2003 that reported proved reserves potentially were overstated and, in such 
critical operating areas as Nigeria and Oman, depended upon unrealistic production forecasts.  In 
each case, Shell either rejected the warnings as immaterial or unduly pessimistic, or attempted to 
manage the potential exposure by, for example, delaying de-booking of improperly recorded 
proved reserves until new, offsetting proved reserves bookings materialized.  
        
       On March 3, 2004, the Royal Dutch and Shell Transport boards of directors requested 
and received the resignations of the chairman of the CMD and the CEO of Shells Exploration 
and Production business (EP) from their respective positions as the chairman of the board of 
directors of Shell Transport and a member of the board of management of Royal Dutch as well 
as their positions as managing directors of the Group.  On April 19, 2004, Shell also announced 
that its Group Chief Financial Officer would step aside from that position. 
        
       Since announcing the reserves recategorization, Shell has undertaken significant remedial 
action, including an investigation by the Group Audit Committee (GAC) and the 
implementation of measures to address the internal control deficiencies that permitted the 
overstatement of proved reserves.   
        
       1.      Shells Internal Guidelines Failed to Conform to Rule 4-10s Criteria for 
               Proved Reserves 
                                                  
               a.     Rule 4-10 and SEC Staff Guidance Thereon 
                
       Royal Dutch and Shell Transport are required to include supplemental information on 
their proved oil and natural gas reserves in their annual reports to the Commission on Form 20-
F.  Rule 4-10 defines proved reserves for reporting purposes as the estimated quantities of 
crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate 
with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing 
economic and operating conditions, i.e., prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made.  
Under Item 102(5) of Regulation S-K, issuers may not disclose in Commission filings estimates 
of oil and gas reserves other than proved reserves unless such disclosure is required under state 
law or the law of a non-U.S. jurisdiction. 
        
       In 2000 and 2001, the Commissions staff issued interpretive guidance on the disclosure 
of proved reserves according to the definitions in Rule 4-10.5
                                                              In this guidance, the staff: 
        
           •   emphasized the conservatism underlying the definition of proved reserves, 
               highlighting that [t]he concept of reasonable certainty implies that, as more 
               technical data becomes available, a positive, or upward, revision is much more 
               likely than a negative, or downward, revision;

           •  observed that [e]conomic uncertainties such as the lack of a market (e.g. stranded 
              hydrocarbons)  can also prevent reserves from being classified as proved;  
 
           •  specifically advised that, in developing frontier areas  [i]ssuers must 
              demonstrate that there is reasonable certainty that a market exists for the 
              hydrocarbons and that an economic method of extracting, treating and 
              transporting them to market exists or is feasible and is likely to exist in the near 
              future.  A commitment by the company to develop the necessary production, 
              treatment and transportation infrastructure is essential to the attribution of proved 
              undeveloped reserves.  Significant lack of progress on the development of such 
              reserves may be evidence of a lack of commitment.  Affirmation of this 
              commitment may take the form of signed sales contracts for the products; request 
              for proposals to build facilities; signed acceptance of bid proposals; memos of 
              understanding between the appropriate organizations and governments; firm plans 
              and timetables established; approved authorization for expenditures to build 
              facilities; approved environmental permits, etc.  Reasonable certainty of 
              procurement of project financing by the company is a requirement for the 
              attribution of proved reserves.  An inordinately long delay in the schedule of 
              development may introduce doubt sufficient to preclude the attribution of proved 
              reserves; and 
            
           •  with respect to hydrocarbon volumes whose production depends on the extension 
              of government permits or licenses, indicated that automatic renewal of such 
              permits or licenses cannot be expected  unless there is a long and clear track 
              record which supports the conclusion that such approvals and renewals are a 
              matter of course.  
 
              b.      The Shell Guidelines 
        
       Shell has, since at least the 1970s, relied on  and instructed and trained its personnel to 
follow  a series of comprehensive, detailed internal guidelines for the estimation and reporting 
of oil and gas resources.  Since the Commission adopted Rule 4-10, Shell also has relied on the 
guidelines to estimate and report proved reserves in its Commission filings.  As outlined 
below, Shells guidelines failed to conform to the requirements of Rule 4-10, as supplemented by 
the Commission staffs interpretative guidance, in a number of significant ways. 
        
                      (i)    1998: Shell adopts new guidelines that substantially increase its 
                             reported proved reserves 
        
       In 1997, following several years of reporting RRR that lagged its peers, Shell EP 
commissioned a Value Creation Team (VCT) to, among other things, assess the companys 
conservatism in reporting proved reserves relative to its competitors.  In 1998, the VCT reported 
to EP management that Shell was more conservative than its peers in reporting proved developed 

                                                5
 
                                                                                                  
---------------------Page 6---------------------

                                                                                                           

oil and gas reserves, 6
                       but that it was early in registering [proved undeveloped] reserves relative 
to competitors. 7
                    
         
        As part of its work, the VCT also evaluated the impact of Shell adopting a 
deterministic approach to estimating reserves in all fields, noting that this would provide 
directly comparable [reserves] figures to American competitors, all of whom used such methods 
to estimate publicly reported proved reserves.   8
                                                    This would have represented a sea-change in 
Shells reserve reporting practices, which historically were founded on probabilistic 
methodology.   9
                 Shell ultimately declined to adopt deterministic methods for all fields, in part 
because this was unlikely to substantially increase reported RRR.  As VCT documentation 
evaluating these approaches describes:   
         
        The only way to provide directly comparable figures to American competitors 
        would be to adopt a deterministic approach to the derivation of proved reserves, 
        whilst retaining the probabilistic approach for internal assessments for project 
        optimization and evaluation.  The result is likely to be an increase in reported 
        proved developed reserves, offset partly, or in whole, by a reduction in proved 
        undeveloped reserves.  Thus published total proved reserves may not benefit 
        significantly. 
 
        Shell instead revised its internal guidelines in 1998 to adopt a system under which it 
maintained its existing probabilistic methods for estimating proved reserves in immature 
fields, but applied more deterministic methods in mature fields, directing OUs to increase 
proved reserves in such fields to equal expectation volumes.     10
                                                                       This guideline revision added 
substantial volumes to Shells reported proved reserves.  For instance, nearly 40% of the total 
proved reserves Shell added in 1998 resulted from this guideline revision.  From 1998 through 
2001, this guideline revision resulted in more than 1.2 billion boe being added to reported proved

 Proved developed oil and gas reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells 
with existing equipment and operating methods.  See Rule 4-10(a)(3) [17 C.F.R. §210.4-10(a)(3)]. 
7
 Proved undeveloped reserves are reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, 
or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.  See Rule 4-10(a)(4) [17 
C.F.R. §210.4-10(4)]. 
8
 An oil and gas reserves estimation methodology is considered deterministic if a single best estimate of reserves 
is made based on known geological, engineering and economic data.   
9
 An oil and gas reserves estimation methodology is considered probabilistic when the known geological, 
engineering and economic data are used to generate a range of estimates and their associated probabilities.   
10
  As used by Shell, expectation reserves are the most likely estimate of hydrocarbon volumes remaining to be 
recovered from a project that is technically and commercially mature, or from a producing asset.  If probabilistic 
techniques are used in reserve estimation, the expectation reserves are the probability weighted average of all 
possible outcomes (commonly referred to as the P50 outcome).  If deterministic techniques are used, expectation 
reserves correspond to the most likely estimate of future recovery.   

Generally, a field was mature under the revised guidelines if total production was greater than 30% of expectation 
reserves.

reserves.  In implementing this change, however, certain of Shells operating units failed to 
perform the detailed analysis necessary to support the resulting increase in proved reserves, 
particularly in Nigeria.  Notably, Shells only public disclosure of this change was a single 
sentence accompanying the supplemental oil and gas information in its 1998 annual report, 
which states only that [e]stimation methods have been refined during 1998.  
        
                      (ii)    Shells internal guidelines did not require market existence or 
                              project commitment 
                       
       Before September 2003, with respect to frontier developments, Shells guidelines 
required neither a currently existing market for a fields hydrocarbons nor a commitment by 
Shell to develop the field or the infrastructure necessary to bring the hydrocarbons to market.  As 
discussed below, the most significant proved reserves addition recorded and maintained as a 
result was the giant Gorgon natural gas field in Australia, originally booked in 1997. 
 
       Though realizing by year-end 2001 that these aspects of its guidelines fell short of SEC 
requirements, Shell did not remedy these shortcomings until its September 2003 guideline 
revisions.  The 2003 guidelines for the first time required certainty of an existing market (e.g., a 
sales agreement for proved natural gas reserves) and a Final Investment Decision on 
significant projects before reserves associated with the project could be deemed proved.  
        
                      (iii)   Shells guidelines were too permissive regarding government 
                              and regulatory approvals 
        
       Despite explicit staff guidance in 2000 and 2001 that reserves subject to significant 
government and regulatory approvals (e.g., production license extensions) required a long and 
clear track record which supports the conclusion that such approvals and renewal are a matter of 
course, Shells guidelines through 2002 failed to require sufficient assurance of such approvals 
and, as a result, Shell booked proved reserves for certain projects for which governmental or 
regulatory approvals were not sufficiently assured for there to be reasonable certainty of the 
recovery of those reserves in future years.  These deficiencies impacted reserves bookings in 
Kazakhstan (Kashagan field), Ireland (Corrib field), Italy (Tempa Rossa field) and the 
Netherlands (Waddenzee fields).    
        
                      (iv)    Application of technical requirements 
        
       Shells guidelines failed in several respects to comply with the technical engineering 
standards embodied in Rule 4-10 for the estimation of oil and natural gas reserve volumes.  
These technical requirements include both restrictions on estimates of the depth and lateral 
extent of reserves  known in the engineering field as lowest known hydrocarbon and lateral 
extent of proved area requirements  as well as standards governing the use of year-end prices, 
improved oil and gas recovery techniques and advanced computer reserve modeling, specifically 
requirements that such methods be supported by sufficient reservoir analogies and/or actual 
performance information.

                      (v)    Requirements and procedures for de-booking non-compliant 
                             reserves 
        
       To be reported as proved, reserves must satisfy Rule 4-10.  If at any point previously 
reported proved reserves fail to do so, they can no longer be included in proved reserves 
disclosures.  Shells guidelines did not require the de-booking of reserves that no longer qualified 
as proved under Rule 4-10.  Instead, the guidelines urged Shell personnel to exert caution in 
de-booking reserves to minimize fluctuations [in proved reserves] over time.  This effectively 
shielded questionable proved reserves from de-booking in all but the most extreme 
circumstances, which contributed to Shells failure to de-book significant volumes that, by year-
end 2001, had been identified as potentially not compliant with Rule 4-10. 
        
       2.     Shell Failed to Maintain Adequate Internal Controls Over Its Reserves 
              Estimation and Reporting Processes 
        
       Shell also failed in several respects to implement and maintain internal controls sufficient 
to provide reasonable assurance that it was estimating and reporting proved reserves accurately 
and in compliance with applicable requirements.  These failures arose from (i) inadequate 
training and supervision of the operating unit personnel responsible for estimating and reporting 
proved reserves in the first instance, and (ii) deficiencies in the internal reserves audit function. 
        
              a.      Inadequate operating unit controls 
        
       Shells reserve estimation and reporting practices were largely decentralized in that they 
required operating unit personnel initially to determine resource volume categorization, 
including estimating volumes of proved reserves for Shells Commission filings and other public 
reporting.  Shell, however, failed to ensure that its personnel were adequately trained with 
respect to the Commissions reporting requirements.  Indeed, Shells Group Reserves Auditor 
observed in January 2003 that operating unit comprehension of both Group guidelines and 
Commission rules regarding proved reserves was generally lacking.   
        
              b.      Deficiencies in the Group Reserve Auditing Function 
        
       Shells decentralized system required an effective internal reserves audit function.  To 
perform this function, Shell historically had engaged as Group Reserves Auditor a lone retired 
Shell petroleum engineer  who worked only part-time and was provided limited resources and 
no staff  to audit its vast worldwide operations.  Although the Group Reserves Auditor was an 
experienced reservoir engineer, he received scant, if any, additional training on such critical 
matters as how he should conduct his work and the rules and standards on which his opinions 
should be based.  He also lacked authority to require operating unit compliance with either 
Commission rules or Group reserves guidelines.  Moreover, he reported to EP management, 
meaning he was answerable to the same people he audited.   
        
       To fulfill his duties, the Group Reserves Auditor made brief visits to a handful of 
operating units per year.  He then issued reports rating the operating units systems, compliance 
with Group guidelines and audit response as good, satisfactory or unsatisfactory and 

                                               8
 
                                                                                                  
---------------------Page 9---------------------

                                                                                                   

opining whether the operating units reported reserves met Group guidelines.  11
                                                                                 Although more 
frequent operating unit visits could occur in principle, they occurred in practice only once every 
four or more years.   
        
       The Group Reserves Auditor also issued an annual report on the reasonableness of 
Shells year-end total reserves summary.  Until his February 2004 report on Shells 2003 proved 
reserves, the Group Reserve Auditor focused as much on whether Group proved reserves 
complied with Group guidelines as he did on whether they complied with Commission 
requirements.   
        
       Critically, the Group Reserves Auditor also failed to act independently in several 
respects.  At times, he allowed proved reserves associated with a project to remain booked 
because he was more bullish on its prospects than the local management responsible for the 
project.  At other times, he advised local management to submit development plans that were 
unlikely ever to be executed solely to support booking proved reserves for otherwise uneconomic 
projects.  This lack of independence facilitated the booking of questionable reserves (such as 
approximately 75 million boe booked in 2001 connection with the Block 18 project in Angola) 
and contributed to Shells maintenance of increasingly questionable bookings (such as Gorgon 
and certain legacy bookings in Brunei) well after they should have been de-booked. 
        
       3.      Shell Booked and Maintained Significant Reserves in Australia, Nigeria and 
               Oman that Failed to Qualify as Proved Reserves Under Rule 4-10 
        
       Shells reserves recategorization involves a number of countries and, often, multiple 
projects or fields within each country.  Events surrounding improper proved reserves bookings or 
maintenance in three of the largest affected countries  Australias Gorgon project, the Shells 
onshore operations in Nigeria and Shells Omani interests (which, collectively, account for 
between approximately 50% and 90% of the recategorization in the years 1997 through 2002)  
exemplify the faults in Shells reserves estimation and reporting practices. 
        
              a. Gorgon        (Australia) 
        
       Gorgon, an undeveloped frontier gas field off the northwest coast of Australia, was 
discovered in 1980.  No gas from Gorgon has ever been sold or firmly contracted for, and Shell 
has yet to make a Final Investment Decision to develop Gorgons hydrocarbons.  Nonetheless, in 
1997, Shell booked over 550 million boe of proved reserves in Gorgon based on indications of 
interest from a prospective purchaser and on the then-current Shell guidelines.  At that time, 
Shell did not have a contract to sell Gorgon gas, had no firm development plan and had not made 
a Final Investment Decision.  By 1999, the Asian economic crisis had, at least, significantly 
delayed whatever market interest there had been in Gorgon gas, and Shell still had not firmly 
committed to develop the field.  Yet, Shell maintained Gorgon as proved reserves.  12
                                                                                        

                                                 
11
  From the start of his tenure in January 1999 until September 2003, the Group Reserves Auditor did not issue a 
single unsatisfactory rating. 
12
  In 1999, further technical work by Gorgons operator indicated additional hydrocarbon volumes in the field.  
Because there was no currently existing market for Gorgon gas, however, Shell decided not to add these volumes as 
                                                9
 
                                                                                                   
---------------------Page 10---------------------

                                                                                                    

        
       On several occasions from 1999 through 2003, Shell reevaluated whether to maintain 
Gorgons proved status.  During this time, Shell learned that none of its partners in Gorgon 
had booked proved reserves in the field.  In March 2000, Shells Australian affiliate was 
instructed by regional Shell management to review options for gradually de-booking Gorgon 
proved reserves, such as by offsetting Gorgon de-bookings against then-anticipated new proved 
reserves bookings in Shells Sunrise natural gas field in the Timor Sea.  Though these offset 
opportunities did not materialize, Shell nevertheless determined to maintain Gorgon as proved 
reserves unless, as Shells then-Group Reserves Coordinator concluded in September 2002, it 
became absolutely clear that development will not proceed in a reasonable time frame.  
        
       By December 2002, Shells EP personnel recognized that Gorgon was a dodgy booking 
whose status as proved reserves was not supportable even under Shells lenient 2002 internal 
reserves guidelines.  Yet, Shell did not de-book Gorgon from proved reserves until the 2004 
reclassification. 
        
              b.      Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) (Nigeria) 
        
       Nigeria represents one of Shells largest worldwide concentrations of reserves and 
production.  Shells Nigerian operations generally are divided into on-shore and shallow-water 
operations (run by SPDC) and deep-water operations.   
        
       By the end of 1999, SPDCs existing proved reserves  which had increased significantly 
because of the 1998 revised Shell reserves guidelines  had grown increasingly dependent on 
production forecasts that gave the appearance that the proved portion of the reserves could be 
produced within the remaining license period.  These projections, in turn, depended on a number 
of assumptions concerning improved economic and operating conditions, such as improvements 
in the countrys economic stability, increases in Shells production quota from the Nigerian 
authorities and increases in Nigerias production quota from OPEC.  Apart from the divergence 
of these assumptions from the requirement in Rule 4-10 that proved reserves be based on 
existing conditions, none of these assumptions was reasonable, particularly in light of the fact 
that SPDCs operations performed well below the projected levels throughout the period. 
        
       Many of these concerns were highlighted for Shell EP management in January 2000 in a 
presentation discussing, among other things, that a substantial part of SPDCs reported proved 
reserves (perhaps more than 600 million boe) was constrained by license expiration and 
depended on unrealistic production forecasts that appeared to have been reverse engineered 
solely to support the reserve figures.13
                                        EP management agreed only to impose a freeze on the 
booking of additional reserves in SPDC and did not order any of the potentially exposed reserves 
to be de-booked.  The very next month, however, the Group Reserves Auditors report on Shells 

                                                                                                                                                             
proved.  Inconsistently, the lack of an existing market did not prompt Shell to de-book the Gorgon reserves already 
recorded.   
13
  This presentation also concluded that Shells 1999 RRR was 37%.  EP management forcefully rejected this 
conclusion and instead caused Shell to report a 56% RRR for that year. 

                                                10
 
                                                                                                    
---------------------Page 11---------------------

                                                                                                   

1999 proved reserves repeated these concerns, noting that SPDC faced license expiration 
problems and could support its proved reserves figures only through significant aspirational 
upturns in future offtake levels in order to justify their proved reserves levels.  The Group 
Reserves Auditor repeated these concerns, without EP taking any steps to de-book non-
compliant reserves, in each of his next two annual reports. 
        
       By early 2002, other Shell reserves personnel, including the Group Reserves Coordinator, 
had raised concerns within EP that SPDCs reported proved reserves could not be produced 
within existing license constraints.  In a February 11, 2002 note to the CMD, the EP reported that 
in certain operations in Nigeria, Oman and Abu Dhabi, no further proved reserves can be 
booked since it is no longer reasonably certain that the proved reserves will be produced within 
license and that [t]he overall exposure should the [operating unit] business plans not transpire 
is 1,300 mln boe.  The note concludes that [w]ork has begun to address this important issue, 
but it failed to recommend any de-bookings to address the license expiration issues.14
        
       EP thereafter continued to review the technical and commercial maturity of SPDCs 
reserves.  After completing the initial phase of its work in September 2003, the EP review team 
concluded that there was an approximately 750 million boe gap between the reported proved 
reserves and those supported by projects in the business plans.  That same month, the Group 
Reserves Auditor reported the results of his just-completed audit of SPDCs proved reserves, 
rating SPDCs proved reserves reporting as unsatisfactory and concluding that there can be 
no doubt that the portfolio of proved oil reserves per 1.1.2003 has been overstated due to 
insufficient maturity in the underlying future projects.  The Group Reserves Auditor noted that 
the precise amount of the de-booking required was dependent on the additional reviews 
already underway by EP.  
        
       By November 2003, the second phase of the EP review teams work was complete.  It 
confirmed the earlier findings of a 750 million boe gap and added another 800 million boe of 
proved reserves that were not sufficiently mature under Shell guidelines.  This information, 
combined with the unsatisfactory SPDC audit report and contemporaneous negative information 
and audit reports on Shells Omani operations, ultimately led Shell to comprehensively review 
all of its proved reserves exposures and, eventually, to the January 9, 2004 recategorization 
announcement. 
        
              c. Oman      
 
       Shells interests in Oman derive from its indirect 34% ownership of Petroleum 
Development of Oman (PDO), an Omani company 60% of which is owned by the Omani 
government.  Shell is the largest private shareholder in PDO and serves as PDOs technical 
adviser.   
 
       At year-end 2000, Shell and PDO determined to raise PDOs proved reserves estimates 
by assuming that, for fields of certain maturity, both proved developed and proved undeveloped 
                                                 
14
  Ultimately, in late 2002 and early 2003, Shell sought and received legal advice both from Nigerian and U.S. 
counsel that Shells Nigerian operation had the equivalent of a legal right to a license extension.  

                                               11
 
                                                                                                   
---------------------Page 12---------------------

                                                                                                 

reserves would be increased to equal the expectation developed and undeveloped volumes.  This 
upward revision was based on the 1998 revisions to Shells guidelines and added 251 million boe 
to Shells reported proved reserves at December 31, 2000.   
 
       In mid-2001, PDO began experiencing a steep production decline.  Within a few months, 
the situation had grown sufficiently dire that PDO took the highly unusual step of withdrawing 
its long-term business plan for 2002.  The production decline also prompted the Omani 
government to question the volume of expectation reserves PDO was carrying, as a result of 
which Shell agreed to a $30 million down payment to the Omani government on what was 
expected to be an eventual refund of expectation reserve booking fees it previously had received.  
By the end of 2001, as its production continued to drop, PDO had no reliable or realistic long-
term plan on which to base its proved reserves reporting.  With Shells encouragement, PDO 
instead adopted an aspirational production forecast to support its reported proved reserves 
figures. 
 
       During 2002, Shell was advised that PDOs proved reserves figures depended upon 
sustaining current production rates, without any declines, throughout the remaining lifetime of 
the production license, which was to expire in 2012.  In view of the production declines already 
being experienced, this was not realistic.  Shell nevertheless continued to report its share of 
PDOs reserves as proved at year-end 2002. 
 
       Further reviews of PDO reserves in 2003 and 2004 ultimately concluded that 393 million 
boe of the Shell share proved reserves associated with PDO had to be de-booked as non-
compliant with Rule 4-10.  Of this amount, 144 million boe were found non-compliant because 
they were associated with projects  not sufficiently mature to qualify as proved undeveloped 
reserves.  The remaining 249 mboe were non-compliant because they were not supported by 
any identified projects. 
        
       4.     Shell Failed to Timely and Effectively Ensure that its Reported Proved 
              Reserves Complied with Rule 4-10 
        
       Until January 2004, Shell failed to timely and appropriately act to ensure that its reported 
proved reserves complied with Rule 4-10 and instead sought to ascertain the extent to which the 
differences could be either reconciled without impacting Shells existing proved reserves or 
rationalized as immaterial.  Further, the non-executive directors of Royal Dutch and Shell 
Transport, including the members of the GAC, were not provided with the information necessary 
for the boards of the two companies to ensure that timely and appropriate action was taken with 
respect to the proved reserves estimation and reporting practices. 
        
       In January 2002, the Group Reserves Auditors report on Shells 2001 proved reserves 
stated that recent clarifications of FASB reserves guidelines by the US Security [sic] and 
Exchange Commission (SEC) have shown that current Group reserves practice regarding the 
first-time booking of Proved reserves in new fields is in some cases too lenient.  The Group 
Reserves Auditor recommended that the Group guidelines should be reviewed [and] [f]irst-time 
bookings should be aligned closer with SEC guidance and industry practice and they should be 
allowed only for firm projects with technical maturity and full economic viability.

       On February 11, 2002, an EP Note for Information to the CMD addressed the divergence 
between Shells guidelines and the Commissions rules and estimated the possible impact of this 
divergence on Shells reported proved reserves.  The Note explicitly relayed that [r]ecently the 
SEC issued clarifications that make it apparent that the Group guidelines for booking Proved 
Reserves are no longer fully aligned with the SEC rules.  Potential exposures identified to the 
CMD at this time included approximately 1 billion boe of proved reserves relating to projects, 
including Gorgon, where potential environmental, political or commercial factors might prevent 
development, and 1.3 billion boe relating to reserves associated with projects, including certain 
projects in Nigeria and Oman, that might not be producible within existing license constraints.  
The note failed to recommend de-bookings to CMD and Shell did not take action to de-book any 
of these proved reserves at that time. 
        
       On February 25, 2002, the EP CEO provided a note to the CMD regarding EPs 2001 
performance.  In his cover note to the presentation, the EP CEO asked his colleagues to keep a 
balanced perspective on EP performance in 2001 and not have it overshadowed by the high 
profile issues around production growth and reserves replacement. As one of the Main Issues, 
the note stated: 
 
       In 2001, SEC issued clarifications of the rules for reserves reporting that made it 
       clear that the probabilistic approach still advocated in the Shell guidelines is, in 
       many cases too aggressive.  This will likely impact future bookings in new fields 
       (e.g., Nigeria SNEPCo and Brazil) and possibly existing booked volumes (e.g., 
       Gorgon, Angola Block 18, Ormen Lange and Waddenzee representing some 1.0 
       bln boe). 
        
       SPDC, PDO and Abu Dhabi represent 18% of EPs production, where reserves 
       can no longer be booked due to license expiry issues and production limitations.  
       The reserves exposures in these OUs is over 1 bln bbls. 

The note failed to recommend de-bookings to CMD and Shell did not take action to de-book any 
of these proved reserves at that time. 
        
       In July 2002, EP again reported to CMD that the SEC was tightening its requirements 
respecting proved reserves.  EP, however, reported that [i]t is considered unlikely that potential 
over-bookings would need to be de-booked in the short term, but the reserves that are exposed to 
project risk or license expiry cannot remain on the books indefinitely if little progress is made to 
convert them to production in a timely manner.  The minutes of this meeting, however, also 
reflect that the executives were advised of the concerns that had arisen within EP that some 
booking practices had been too aggressive in the past.  A Note for Discussion prepared for this 
meeting repeats the observation that [w]ith the benefit of hindsight, some of the organic 
revisions made in recent years now appear somewhat aggressive, principally in Gorgon and 
SPDC.  The Note observes that without Gorgon and SPDC bookings, total Proved RRR over 
the last 10 years would be reduced from 102% to 88%. 
        
       By September 2002, the CEO of EP internally spoke in blunt terms of his perception of 
the operational and performance problems facing EP, noting to his CMD colleagues that [w]e 
                                               13
 
                                                                                                 
---------------------Page 14---------------------

                                                                                                  

are struggling on all key criteria and that RRR remains below 100% mainly due to aggressive 
booking in 1997-2000.  He further observed that we have tried to adhere to a bunch of criteria 
that can only be managed successfully for so long and admonished that [g]iven the external 
visibility of our issues (lean organic development portfolio funnel, RRR low, F&D unit costs 
rising), the market can only be fooled if 1) credibility of the company is high, 2) medium and 
long-term portfolio refreshment is real and/or 3) positive trends can be shown on key indicators.   
        
       A month later, the Group Chairman emailed the EP CEO that he was not contemplating 
a change in the external promise . . . .  The next day, the EP CEO responded, stating I must 
admit that I become sick and tired about arguing about the hard facts and also can not perform 
miracles given where we are today.  If I was interpreting the disclosure requirements literally 
(Sorbanes-Oxley Act etc.) [sic] we would have a real problem. 
        
       None of these events prompted Shell to de-book significant volumes.  To the contrary, 
Shell continued to make large, questionable proved reserves bookings during this period, such as 
the September 2002 booking of 380 million boe in the Kashagan field in Kazakhstan, on which 
project Shell did not expect to make a Final Investment Decision until 2003 at the earliest.  This 
booking alone increased Shells 2002 RRR by approximately 26%. 
 
       By the Summer of 2003, Shells analysis of reserves exposures had progressed, but still 
no de-bookings were recommended to the CMD.  A July 22, 2003 CMD Note for Information 
reported that some 1040 million boe (5%) is considered to be potentially at risk.  The note 
concluded, however, at this stage, no action in relation to entries in the [Proved Reserves 
Exposure] Catalogue is recommended . . . . It should be noted that the total potential exposure 
listed in Appendix C is broadly offset by the potential to include gas fuel and flare volumes in 
external reserves disclosures.  The Proved Reserves Exposure Catalogue in Appendix C 
quantifies exposures at approximately 1 billion boe and threats at approximately 1.6 billion 
boe, or a total of approximately 2.6 billion boe known to be or potentially noncompliant with 
Rule 4-10. 
        
       In late August 2003, EP completed a Note for Information to the GAC on Shells reserves 
practices.  The final version, dated August 26, 2003, was included in materials circulated to the 
GAC for its October 21, 2003 meeting.  The Note apprises the Committee of steps taken to 
address possible non-compliance with the Commissions regulations.  The GAC, however, was 
advised that [m]uch, if not all, of the potential exposure arising from interpretation of factors 
listed above [Possible areas of non-compliance with SEC regulations] is offset by Shells 
practice of not disclosing reserves in relation to gas production that is consumed on site as fuel or 
(incidental) flaring and venting. 
        
       Notwithstanding the disclosure of potential exposures, in the October 21 meeting with 
the GAC, EP personnel failed to update the Committee with several critical facts that had 
emerged since the Note was prepared, including the unsatisfactory audit report on Nigeria, the 
initial conclusions of the SPDC review that there was a significant gap between proved 

                                               14

reserves carried and those that could be supported, and a substantially reduced estimate of the 
potential offset from fuel and flare gas.15
                                               
        
       5.      Shells Remedial Actions 
                                                   
       Shell has undertaken substantial remedial efforts in connection with the reserves 
recategorization as well as corporate governance issues raised following the recategorization 
announcement, including the following: 

       •   a determination to self-report the need for a recategorization to both the public and 
           the Commission prior to the involvement of any external governmental agency or 
           public release of the reserves overstatement; 

       •   an independent investigation into the facts and circumstances ordered by the GAC, 
           the results of which have been provided to the Commission; 

       •   retention of an independent reserves engineering firm to assist in a review of Shells 
           proved reserves, which led to the March 18 and April 19 announcements of additional 
           recategorizations; 

       •   formal review and approval of all reported reserves by the CMD and review by the 
           GAC on an annual basis; 

       •   enhancements to the resources of the Group Reserves Auditor, including the 
           provision for systematic and consistent use of external reserves experts in the audit 
           process; 

       •   a restructuring of the Group Reserves Audit function to report through the Group 
           Internal Audit function, with direct access to the GAC; 

       •   expansion of the Group Reserves Audit program to include more frequent and 
           detailed audits, including annual audits of every major operating unit; 

       •   implementation of a Global Reserves Committee within EP, including an approval 
           process for all reserves through regional peer challenges on reserves decisions; 

       •   a restructuring of the EP business to place reserves reporting within the technical 
           reserves function rather than the planning function; 

       •   strengthening of the line responsibilities for reserve reporting within EP to ensure that 
           appropriate levels of authority and responsibility for reserves booking and de-booking

  Although the August 26, 2003 Note for Discussions report on possible fuel and flare offsets may have been 
consistent with EPs understanding at the time it was finalized, by October 20, 2003, a Note to the CEO of EP 
reported that, for reasons EP did not yet understand, the potential offset from fuel and flare gas would be only 
approximately 300 million boe rather than the 1 billion boe previously believed.

           decisions are assigned to local Chief Reservoir Engineers, local management and EP 
           management; 

       •  inclusion of reserves reporting in the existing Group assurance and disclosure 
           controls review processes; 

       •  focused and enhanced training of EP reserves staff worldwide to ensure that the 
           Commissions rules, guidance and compliance requirements are communicated to and 
           understood by all involved in the reserves estimation and reporting process; and 

       •  significant revision to the Shell guidelines to ensure that they provide clear direction 
           compliant with the requirements of Rule 4-10 on the reporting of proved reserves.   

       •  a restructuring of the Group finance function to make business unit chief financial 
           officers report directly to the Group CFO; 

       •  enhancement of the Group legal function to improve the ability of Group 
           management to benefit from appropriate legal advice concerning potential corporate 
           governance, reporting and disclosure issues. 

       •  appointment of a non-executive chairman of Shell Transport and a non-executive 
           chair of the conference of the boards of Royal Dutch and Shell; 

       •  creation of a committee of members of the Royal Dutch and Shell Transport boards to 
           study issues relating to the structure and governance of the Group, including 
           consultation with shareholders and a public report of the results of the study; and 

       •  a public commitment by the board of Royal Dutch to submit a proposal to 
           shareholders at Royal Dutchs 2005 Annual General Meeting to abolish the priority 
           shares in Royal Dutch.

                                     LEGAL ANALYSIS 
                                                 
A.     Violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 
 
       Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule  10b-5 thereunder prohibit the em ployment 
of a fraudulent scheme or the making of material misrepresentations and omissions in connection 
with the purchase o    r sale of securities.     To violate these pr     ovisions, the alleged 
misrepresentations or omitted facts must be mater ial.  Inf ormation is m aterial if it would hav e 
assumed significance in the investm ent deliberations of a reasonable investor.    Basic, Inc. v. 
Levinson, 485 U.S. 224 (1988). 
 
       Violations of these prov isions require proof of  scienter.   Aaron v. SEC , 446 U.S. 680 
(1980).  Scienter is the mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate or defraud, Ernst 
& Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185, 193 (1976), which may be  established by showing that the 
defendants acted intentionally or with severe recklessness.   See Broad v. Rockwell International 

                                               16
 
                                                                                                 
---------------------Page 17---------------------

                                                                                                 

Corp., 642 F.2d 929 (5th Cir.) (   en banc ),  cert. denied , 454 U.S. 965 (1981).  To establish 
scienter on the part of a com pany, the mental state of the companys of ficers is imputed to the 
company.  SEC v. Manor Nursing Centers, Inc., 458 F.2d 1082, 1089 n.3 (2d Cir. 1972). 
        
       Based on the conduct described above, Respondents Royal Dutch and Shell Transport 
violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Respondents knowingly 
or recklessly reported proved reserves that were non-compliant with Rule 4-10, and failed (i) to 
ensure that Shells internal proved reserves estimation and reporting guidelines complied with 
Rule 4-10 and (ii) to take timely and appropriate action to ensure that their reported proved 
reserves were not overstated in their filings with the Commission and other public statements. 
        
B.     Violations of Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 12b-20 
 
       Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13a-1 thereunder require issuers whose 
securities are registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act to file 
annual reports with the Commission.  These reports must be complete and accurate in all 
material respects.  United States v. Bilzerian, 926 F.2d 1285, 1298 (2d Cir. 1991); SEC v. Savoy 
Indus., Inc., 587 F.2d 1149, 1165 (D.C. Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 913 (1979). Rule 12b-
20 of the Exchange Act requires that an issuers periodic reports include any additional 
information necessary to make the required statements, in the light of the circumstances under 
which they are made, not misleading. 
        
       Based on the conduct described above, Respondents Royal Dutch and Shell Transport 
violated Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 12b-20 thereunder.  
Respondents failures to ensure that Shell estimated and reported proved reserves accurately in 
compliance with Rule 4-10 caused them to file annual reports on Form 20-F for the years 1997 
through 2002 that were materially inaccurate in that they overstated Respondents reported 
proved reserves and accompanying supplemental information, including the standardized 
measure of future cash flows. 
        
C.     Violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) and Rule 13b2-1 
 
       Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act requires issuers to make and keep books, 
records, and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions 
and dispositions of the assets of the issuer.  Rule 13b2-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act 
provides that no person shall directly or indirectly falsify or cause to be falsified, any book, 
record or account subject to Section 13(b)(2)(A).  Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act 
requires issuers to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to 
provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the 
preparation of accurate financial statements.  No showing of scienter is necessary to establish a 
violation of these provisions.  See SEC v. World-Wide Coin Investments, Ltd., et al., 567 F. Supp. 
724, 749-51 (N.D. Ga. 1983). 
        
       Based on the conduct described above, Respondents Royal Dutch and Shell Transport 
violated Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act.  Respondents failed to 
ensure that Shell created and maintained accurate estimates of its proved reserves in compliance 

                                               17

with Rule 4-10, and failed to ensure that Shell implemented and maintained adequate controls 
with respect to Shells reserves processes sufficient to provide assurance that the reserves were 
estimated and reported accurately in accordance with Rule 4-10. 
        
                                               V. 
                                          FINDINGS 
                                                 
       Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that Respondents Royal Dutch and Shell 
Transport violated Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and 
Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13b2-1 thereunder. 
                                                 
                                              VI. 
                                      UNDERTAKINGS 
                                                 
A.     Shell has undertaken and agreed to cooperate fully with the Commission in any and all 
investigations, litigation, or other proceedings relating to or arising from the matters described 
herein.  In connection with such cooperation, Shell has undertaken: 
 
       1.     To produce, without service of subpoena, any and all non-privileged documents 
requested by the Commission staff; and 
 
       2.     To use its best efforts consistent with applicable local laws to make available 
current Shell employees, including non-United States nationals, (1) to be interviewed by the 
Commissions staff at such times and such locations as the staff may reasonably direct and (2) to 
appear and testify without service of subpoena or other process in such investigations, 
depositions, hearings or trials as may be requested by the Commissions staff. 
 
B.     Shell has undertaken to spend $5 million in the development and implementation of a 
comprehensive internal compliance program under the direction and oversight of the Groups 
Legal Director.  Shell has committed that such amounts will be in addition to any amounts that 
already have been budgeted to the Groups compliance function.  Shell has further undertaken to 
report to the Commission staff within twelve months on the expenditure of the funds and the 
status of the compliance program. 
 
       In determining to accept the Offer of Royal Dutch and Shell Transport, the Commission 
has considered these undertakings as well as Shells remedial measures and cooperation with the 
Commission staffs investigation.

                                             VII. 
 
       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in the Offer.
