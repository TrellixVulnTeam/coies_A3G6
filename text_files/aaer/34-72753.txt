      On May 28, 2014, the Zhongguancun Listed Companies Association ("ZLCA") filed a 
motion for leave to file an amicus brief.  The Division of Enforcement opposes the motion and 
ZLCA, in turn, has filed a reply.  We have determined to grant the motion as set forth herein. 

      By way of background, these proceedings concern respondents' alleged willful refusal to 
provide the Commission with audit work papers in violation of their obligations under Section 
106 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as amended by Section 929J of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street 
Reform and Consumer Protection Act.1
                                      The initial decision denied, for a period of six months, 
the privilege of practicing or appearing before the Commission to four of the five respondents  
and censured the remaining one.  The Commission granted review and the opening brief of the 
appealing respondents is due September 19, 2014. 

      In support of its request to file an amicus brief, ZLCA states that the initial decision, 
unless modified or reversed by the Commission, will have a "significant adverse impact" on 
ZLCA's members who are U.S. listed and who are audited by a China-based accounting firm.  
More specifically, ZLCA asserts that respondents have issued audit opinions for certain of its 
members and that these companies will "face the possibility of having their shares delisted" if 
they cannot obtain audited financial statements.  It desires to file an amicus brief discussing the 
"broad based policy interests" that, in its view, are implicated by the initial decision.    In its reply

                                                2 
                                                  
brief, ZLCA additionally represents that it "did not speak to or collaborate with any party" in 
connection with seeking to file an amicus brief in this proceeding.2
                                                                     

       Rule of Practice 210(d) governs amicus participation in the Commission's administrative 
proceedings.  In relevant part, it provides that:  "An amicus brief may be filed conditionally with 
the motion for leave.  The motion for leave shall identify the interest of the movant and shall 
state the reasons why a brief of an amicus curiae is desirable."3
                                                                  The Division contends that the 
Commission should deny the motion for four reasons.  None of them is persuasive.     
        
       The Division leads off with the argument   that the  Rules of Practice categorically forbid 
the filing of amicus briefs in disciplinary proceedings.  It relies on Rule 210(a)(1), which states 
that "[n]o person shall be granted leave to become a party or a non-party participant on a limited 
basis in an enforcement or disciplinary proceeding ," subject to an exception inapplicable here, 
and that the instant proceeding is a "disciplinary proceeding" within the meaning of that rule.4
                                                                                                 
This reliance is misplaced, as the structure of Rule 210 demonstrates.  Rule 210 envisions four 
categories of potential participation in Commission proceedings  :  Persons can participate or 
intervene as a party (paragraph (b)), participate as a non-party on a limited basis (paragraph (c)), 
participate as an amicus (paragraph (d)), or participate by filing a statement of views (paragraph 
(e)).  Thus, even though party participation pursuant to paragraph (b) and limited, non- party 
                                                 
2
       We note that ZLCA's reply is technically untimely because the Division served its 
opposition on June 9 and the reply was filed on June 18.  Rule of Practice 154(b) provides that 
"[r]eply briefs [in support of motions] shall be filed within three days after service of the 
opposition."  17 C.F.R. § 201.154(b).   Under Rule 160(a), intermediate weekends and legal 
holidays are "excluded from the computation when," as here, "the period of time prescribed or 
allowed is seven days or less."  Id.                                 § 201.160(a).  Here, there were no intermediate weekends and 
legal holidays, which makes June 12 the end of the three -day response period.  Because service 
of the Division's opposition was by mail, three additional days are "added to the prescribed 
period for response" under Rule 160(b).  June 15 falls on a Sunday, so the due date for the reply 
was the next day, or June 16.  In short, Rule 160(a) and Rule 160(b) work together as follows  : 
(1) the underlying period is computed, excluding intermediate weekends and holidays     if the 
period is seven days or less; (2) if service is by mail, then three additional calendar days are 
appended to that period; and (3) finally, if the resulting day itself falls on a weekend or holiday, 
the period runs until the next day that is not a weekend or holiday.  E.g., Nat'l Sav. Bank of 
Albany v. Jefferson Bank, 127 F.R.D. 218, 221-222 & nn.6-7 (S.D. Fla. 1989) (interpreting 
analogous provisions of former Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a) and 6(e)); 4A Wright & Miller, Federal 
Practice and Procedure § 1171 (2d ed. 1987).  Because the Commission has not previously 
clarified the interaction of these rules and no prejudice would result from accepting ZLCA's two -
day-late filing, we will  consider its reply. 
3
       17 C.F.R. § 201.210(d)(2).   Rule 210(d)(2) also provides that, "[e] xcept as all parties 
otherwise consent, any amicus curiae shall file its brief within the time allowed the party whose 
position the amicus will support."  It is uncontested that ZLCA's motion is timely.

       17 C.F.R. § 201.210(a)(1).

                                                3 
                                                 
participation pursuant to paragraph (c) are generally forbidden in disciplinary proceedings, Rule 
210 nonetheless allows a "person . . . [to] seek to participate in such proceedings as an amicus, 
pursuant to paragraph (d)."5
                              The Commission has previously   allowed amicus participation in 
disciplinary proceedings.6
                           
        
       Next the Division contends  that ZLCA's motion for leave is deficient because it does not 
attach the amicus brief that ZLCA proposes to file .  Although the Division is correct to note that 
Rule 210(d) is "based on Rule 29" of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, and that Rule 29 
does direct that the " motion . . . be accompanied by the proposed brief," Rule 210(d) itself 
contains no such requirement. 7
                                 To the contrary, the Commission's Rules of Practice state that 
that an "amicus brief may                     "not must      "be filed conditionally with the motion for leave."8
                                                                                            
        
       The Division's third argument is that ZLCA's motion failed "even to identify its 
members" whose financial statements are audited by respondents, and so did not adequately    set 
forth ZLCA's interest in the proceeding.  It relies, again, on Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 
29, which requires amicus briefs filed in the federal courts of appeals to include, among other 
things, a corporate disclosure statement and "a concise statement of the identity of the amicus 
curiae."9
          Rule 210 imposes no comparable requirement    s, however.  At any rate, it appears clear 
what ZLCA's asserted interest is:  The motion represents that some of ZLCA's members     are 
audited by respondents and face a risk of being delisted if the initial decision is upheld and they 
cannot find a replacement auditor.10
                                      Although it remains to be determined how well- founded 
this fear is, Rule 210(d) does not require that an amicus prove with certainty that its interests will 
be harmed by an adverse result in the proceeding. 
         
       Finally, the Division argues that the  ZLCA's intended brief will not assist with the 
Commission's decisionmaking, and so is not "desirable" within the meaning of Rule 210.  It

                                                4 
                                                  
asserts that ZLCA lacks any special expertise regarding the issues and that its brief likely would 
repeat many of the same arguments raised by respondents themselvese.g.  , ZLCA's argument 
that imposing practice restrictions on respondents would have adverse collateral consequences 
on issuers and investors.  ZLCA replies that its amicus brief will offer the "perspective of issuers 
and their shareholders" and "policy insights" that otherwise will not be presented by the parties. 
        
       In part, the Division's point is well taken.  The purpose of an amicus brief is to set forth a 
position on the "legal or policy issues in the proceeding" in a way that "add[s] something 
distinctive to the presentation of the issues, rather than serving as a mere conduit for the views of 
one of the parties."11
                      An amicus brief that " merely duplicate[s] the arguments of the parties . . . 
waste[s] the court's time ."12
                              But some amount of overlap is inevitable especially since an 
amicus may not inject new " issues that have not been presented by the parties"13
                                                                                  or enlarge the 
record with new evidence bearing on adjudicative facts 14
                                                         so an amicus need not show     that the 
parties are inadequately or incompletely briefing the case.15
                                                              Furthermore, because the decision 
whether to grant leave to file typically is made at an early stage of review proceedings, and 
because the Commission's rules do not require that the proposed amicus brief be tendered along

15
       Neonatology Assocs.             , 293 F.3d at 131.  The Division asserts that the Commission applied 
a different standard in KMPG   Peat Marwick LLP , Exchange Act Release 44050, 2001 WL 
223378 (Mar. 8, 2001).  There, the Commission issued an opinion finding that the respondent, an 
accounting firm, had violated Rule 2-02(b) of Regulation S-X.  Almost a month after the 
respondent filed a motion for reconsideration, a professional association sought leave to file an 
amicus brief.  Id.               at *7 n.18.  In denying the motion for leave to file an amicus brief  , the 
Commission relied upon  the untimeliness of that  motion , the association's failure to provide any 
explanation for the delay, and the fact that the Rules of Practice explicitly forbid unsolicited 
responses to motions for reconsideration.  Thus, in the context of "amicus filings on 
reconsideration," the Commission held that " only under extraordinary circumstances" would 
leave to file an amicus brief be granted.  Id.                                         ; cf. also D.C. Cir. R. 35(f) ("No amicus curiae brief 
in response to or in support of a petition for rehearing en banc will be received by the clerk 
except by invitation of the court.").  The professional association's proposed brief, which "merely 
reiterate[d]" the respondent's arguments urging reconsideration, did not satisfy that standard.  
Amicus participation in other contextse.g., before  the Commission issues a final order is not 
governed by KMPG Peat Marwick LLP            's "extraordinary circumstances" test.  
---------------------Page 5---------------------

                                                5 
                                                  
with the motion seeking leave, it would be difficult, as a practical matter, to determine in 
advance that amicus participation could not possibly contribute to the briefs of the parties. 
        
       Considering these circumstances, we find that ZLCA has sufficiently described how its 
intended brief might be "desirable" within the meaning of Rule 210(d)(2) and, accordingly, have 
determined to allow ZLCA to file an amicus brief.   If that brief merely repackages respondents' 
arguments, it is unlikely to make a contribution to the Commission's resolution of this 
proceeding.  After the amicus brief has been filed, the Division may seek leave for a modest 
expansion of the length limitation for its combined principal and response brief if it demonstrates 
that additional space is essential to answering the amicus.  
        
       Accordingly, it is ORDERED that ZLCA's motion for leave to file an amicus brief is 
GRANTED.  ZLCA shall file its amicus brief, not to exceed 5,000 words in length, within the 
time allowed for the appealing respondents to file their consolidated opening brief.
