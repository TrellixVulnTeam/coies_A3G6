                                               II.  
 
       In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the 
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings 
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over her and the subject matter of these 
proceedings, and the findings contained in Section III.3.  below, which are admitted, Respondent 
consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Rule 102(e) 
of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions 
(“Order”), as set forth below.   
 
                                              III.  
 
       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that: 
 
              1.      Seruga, age 33, has been a certified public accountant licensed to practice in  
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  She served as Controller at World Health Alternatives, Inc. 
(“World Health”) from 2003 until August 2005. 
        
              2.      World Health was, at all relevant times, a Florida corporation with its 
principal place of business in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  World Health was engaged in the medical 
staffing business. At all relevant times, World Health common stock was registered with the 
Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), 
and traded on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board.   
 
              3.      On January 4, 2010, a final judgment was entered by consent against 
Seruga, permanently enjoining her from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of  
1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2(b) 
thereunder, and aiding and abetting violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-
20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder, in the civil action entitled Securities and Exchange Commission 
v. Richard E. McDonald, et al. , Civil Action Number 09-CV-1685, in the United States District 
Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania.   
 
       4.     The Commission’s complaint alleged, among other things, that Seruga, at the 
 direction of World Health’s former President and Chief Executive Officer and on her own 
 accord, engaged in a fraudulent scheme that resulted in World Health filing materially false and 
 misleading financial statements in the company’s annual and quarterly reports from the first 
 quarter of 2003 through the first quarter of 2005.  The complaint alleged that Seruga falsified 
 World Health’s books and records by, among other things, understating expenses and liabilities 
 through numerous false and improper accounting entries.  In addition, the complaint alleged that 
 Seruga knowingly provided false information to World Health’s auditors.

             In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
impose the sanction agreed to in Respondent Seruga’s Offer. 
 
             Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that Seruga is suspended from 
appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant. 
 
 By the Commission.
