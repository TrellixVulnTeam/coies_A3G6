                                       I. 
 
              The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) deems it appropriate 
that cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C 
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), against ECO2 Plastics, Inc. 
(ECO 2 or Respondent).   
                                         
                                       II. 
 
              In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted 
an Offer of Settlement (the Offer) which the Commission has determined to accept.  
Solely for the purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on 
behalf of the Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting 
or denying the findings herein, except as to the Commissions jurisdiction over it and the 
subject matter of these proceedings, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry 
of this Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist 
Order (Order), as set forth below.

                                            III. 
 
              On the basis of this Order and Respondents Offer, the Commission finds that: 
 
       1. ECO       2 is a Delaware corporation located in San Francisco, California.  The 
companys common stock (symbol EOPI) is quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board and the 
Pink Sheets operated by Pink OTC Markets Inc.  According to EDGAR, it appears that 
ECO  2 has never registered a class of securities under the Exchange Act but has registered 
offerings of securities under the Securities Act of 1933.  Therefore, at all relevant times, 
ECO  2 has been subject to the reporting requirements of Section 15(d) of the Exchange 
Act. 
        
       2. ECO       2 failed to comply with Items 307 and 308T of Regulation S-B in its 
Form 10-KSB report filed on April 15, 2008 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 
2007, as a result of which the Respondent violated Exchange Act Section 15(d) and Rules 
15d-1 and 15d-15 thereunder. 
        
       3. ECO       2 failed to comply with Item 307 of Regulation S-K in its Form 10-K 
report filed on April 14, 2009 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008, as a result of 
which the Respondent violated Exchange Act Section 15(d) and Rules 15d-1 and 15d-15 
thereunder. 

                                            IV. 
                                               
        In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the 
sanctions agreed to in Respondent ECO    2s Offer. 
 
        Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that : 
 
              Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Respondent ECO2 cease and desist 
from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Section 15(d) of the 
Exchange Act and Rules 15d-1 and 15d-15 thereunder.   
 
 
 
 
              By the Commission.

       Secretary
