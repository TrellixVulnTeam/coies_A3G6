                                              I.  
 
       The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the 
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against 
Matthew W. Hardey (“Respondent” or “Hardey”) pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(i) of the  
Commission’s Rules of Practice.1 
                                  
                                                

                                                 
1
 Rule 102(e)(3)(i) provides, in relevant part, that: 
 
       The Commission, with due regard to the public interest and without preliminary hearing, 
may, by order, . . . suspend from appearing or practicing before it any . . . accountant . . . who has 
been by name . . . permanently enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction, by reason of his 
or her misconduct in an action brought by the Commission, from violating or aiding and abetting 
the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or of the rules and regulations 
thereunder.

                                              II.  
 
       In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the 
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings  
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these 
proceedings, and the findings contained in Section III. 3  below, which are admitted, Respondent 
consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Rule 102(e) 
of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions 
(“Order”), as set forth below.   
 
                                              III.  
 
       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that: 
 
              1.      Hardey, age 59, was the CFO and vice president of finance of Newpark 
Resources, Inc. (“Newpark”) from 1991 until his termination in 2006.  In that capacity, Hardey was 
responsible for the accuracy of Newpark’s financial statements.  Hardey has never had a CPA 
license.  Newpark dismissed Hardey in June 2006 for his involvement in the transactions at issue in 
the civil proceeding filed against him by the Commission.  
        
              2.      Newpark was, at all relevant times,  a Delaware corporation with its principal 
place of business in New Orleans, Louisiana.  Newpark was engaged in the business of operating as 
a diversified oil and gas industry supplier with three operating segments: fluid systems and 
engineering, mat and integrated  services, and environmental services.  At all relevant times, 
Newpark’s common stock was registered with the  Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), and traded on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 
              3.      On July 16, 2009, the  Commission filed a complaint against Hardey in SEC 
v. Matthew W. Hardey, L. Cyru s DeBlanc and Joe E. Penland, Civil Action No. 09-4414 (E.D. 
La.).  On July 29, 2010, the court entered an order permanently enjoining Hardey, by consent, from 
future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”), Sections 10(b) 
and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder, and from 
aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act  
and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13 and 13a-14 thereunder.  Hardey was also ordered to pay a  
$75,000 civil money penalty and was barred from serving as an officer and director of a public  
company. 
 
              4.      The Commission’s Complaint alleged, among other things, that Hardey 
engaged in a fraudulent scheme which resulted in Newpark filing materially false and misleading 
financial statements in the company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended 
December 31, 2003.  The Complaint alleged that Hardey engaged in a number of improper 
accounting practices that enabled Newpark to avoid writing-off approximately $4.2 million of its 
reported receivables in the annual financial statements for fiscal year 2003.  If such receivables had 

                                               2
  
---------------------Page 3---------------------

been written-off as required by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), the 
associated bad debt expenses would have caused Newpark to report a significant net loss in its 
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003 as opposed to the $494,000 of net income  
that the company actually reported in the filing.   
           
                                                             IV. 
                                                                
         In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
impose the sanction agreed to in Respondent Hardey’s Offer. 
 
         Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that Hardey is suspended                
from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant.   
 
  
 
 By the Commission.

       Secretary
