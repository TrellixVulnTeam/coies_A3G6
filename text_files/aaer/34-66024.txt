       The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) deems it appropriate to issue 
an order of forthwith suspension of Eric Jon Strasser (Strasser) pursuant to Rule 102(e)(2) of 
the Commissions Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R. §200.102(e)(2)].1

controller in that he prepared Soyos periodic filings with the Commission and was a liaison 
between Soyo and its auditor.  In the mid-1980s, Strasser worked as an auditor and passed the 
examination to become a certified public accountant, but he never obtained a license.
