                                               II.  
        
       In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the 
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the 
findings herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of 
these proceedings, and the findings contained in Section III.5 below, which are admitted, 
Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant 
to Rule 102(e) of the Commission=s Rules of Practice and Section 203(f) of the Investment 
Advisers Act of 1940, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (“Order”), as set 
forth below. 
        
                                              III.  
        
       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that: 
 
                          1. Petrofsky is a certified public accountant in Alabama. 
        
              2.      From November 2003 until August 2008, Petrofsky was an investment 
adviser representative employed by Professional Asset Strategies, LLC (“PAS”), an investment 
adviser registered with the Commission and based in Birmingham, Alabama.  Petrofsky, 31 years 
old, is a resident of Birmingham, Alabama. 
        
              3.      On December 3, 2009, Petrofsky pled guilty to one count of wire fraud 
and one count of forged security before the United States District Court for the Northern District  
of Alabama in United States v. Andrew D. Petrofsky, Crim. Information No. 2:09-cr-00435-LSC-
HGD.  
        
              4.      The counts of the criminal information to which Petrofsky pled guilty 
alleged, inter alia, that Petrofsky used his position at PAS to steal money from client accounts he 
managed; that Petrofsky used unauthorized wire transfers and forged checks to steal money from  
his clients; and that Petrofsky attempted to conceal his theft by redirecting client account 
statements to his home, altering the statements to disguise withdrawals, and sending the altered 
statements to clients.  
        
              5.      On April 19, 2010, a judgment of conviction was entered against 
Petrofsky in United States v. Andrew D. Petrofsky, No. 2:09-cr-00435-LSC-HGD, in the United 
States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, finding him guilty of one count of 
wire fraud and one count of forged security. As a result of this conviction, Petrofsky was 
sentenced to 44 months of imprisonment in a federal penitentiary, with three years of supervised 
release to follow, and ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $876,651. 
        
        
                                                2

                                               IV. 
        
       In view of the foregoing, the Commission finds that Petrofsky has been convicted of a 
felony within the meaning of Rule 102(e)(2) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice and deems it 
appropriate and in the public interest to impose the sanctions agreed to in Respondent 
Petrofsky’s Offer. 
 
       Accordingly, it is hereby  ORDERED: 
 
                                     A. that Petrofsky is forthwith suspended from appearing or practicing before the 
Commission pursuant to Rule 102(e)(2) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice. 
 
       B.      Pursuant to Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act, that Respondent Petrofsky be, and 
hereby is barred from association with any investment adviser.  
        
       C.      Any reapplication for association by the Respondent will be subject to the 
applicable laws and regulations governing the reentry process, and reentry may be conditioned 
upon a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the satisfaction of any or all of the 
following:  (a) any disgorgement ordered against the Respondent, whether or not the 
Commission has fully or partially waived payment of such disgorgement; (b) any arbitration 
award related to the conduct that served as the basis for the Commission order; (c) any self-
regulatory organization arbitration award to a customer, whether or not related to the conduct 
that served as the basis for the Commission order; and (d) any restitution order by a self-
regulatory organization, whether or not related to the conduct that served as the basis for the 
Commission order. 
        
       By the Commission.
