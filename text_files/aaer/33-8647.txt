              The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) deems it appropriate that public 
administrative proceedings and cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against 
Kenneth R. LeCrone (LeCrone or Respondent), pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 
1933 (Securities Act), Section 21C of the Secu rities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), 
and Rule 102(e)(1)(iii) of the Commissions Rules of Practice.1

 Rule 102(e)(1)(iii) provides, in relevant part, that: 
 
              The Commission may. . .deny, temporarily or permanently, the privilege of appearing or

willfully aided and abetted the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws and the 
rules or regulations thereunder.

                                              II. 
 
              In anticipation of the institution of these  proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (Offer) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the purpose of 
these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of   the Commission, or to 
which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings herein, except as 
to the Commissions jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these proceedings, which are 
admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of   this Order Instituting Public Administrative and 
Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21C 
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule  102(e) of the Commissions Rules of Practice, 
Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order (Order), as 
set forth below. 
 
                                              III. 
 
              On the basis of this Order and Respondents Offer, the Commission finds that: 
 
A. Respondent     
 
              LeCrone, age 41, a resident of Centennial, Colorado, was an auditor at Levine, Hughes, and 
Mithuen, Inc. (LHM), a Denver, Colorado accounting firm, where he was employed from 1997 
through 1999.  LeCrone has been a licensed certifi ed public accountant in Colorado since 1993.   
LeCrone was responsible for the performance of  portions of LHMs 1998 and 1999 audits of 
Sport-Haley, Inc. (Sport-Haley), serving as the in-charge staff  accountant in 1998 and a 
manager in 1999.   
        
B. Facts       
        
       1.     Sport-Haley is a Denver, Colorado compa ny that designs, markets, and contracts 
for the manufacture of golf apparel and outerwear.  Sport-Haleys stock is registered with the 
Commission pursuant to Section 15(d) of the   Exchange Act and is quoted on the NASDAQ 
National Market System.  
 
       Improper Accounting for Work-In-Process (WIP) Inventory 
 
       2.     Beginning no later than early 1998, Sport-Haleys computerized inventory system 
began improperly accumulating WIP inventory.  As a result of the improper accrual, Sport-
Haleys WIP inventory balance ballooned to $1.7 million during its 1998 fiscal year.  The 1998 
WIP inventory accounted for 9.5 percent of Spor t-Haleys total inventory and had increased by 
more than 900 percent from the prior year.  Despite the fact that the 1998 WIP inventory balance 
was substantially higher than the expected $200,000 to $500,000 balance, Sport-Haley never 
physically counted the companys WIP inventory in fiscal 1998 and failed to take any reasonable 
steps to verify the amount of WIP inventory during the companys 1998 fiscal year.  LeCrone did 
not perform, or direct others to perform,   sufficient audit procedur es on Sport-Haleys WIP 

                                               2 
---------------------Page 3---------------------

inventory.  As a result, LeCrone allowed Spor    t-Haley to include materially overstated WIP 
inventory in its 1998 financial statements.   
        
       3.     During the audit of Sport-Haleys financia l statements for the fiscal year ended 
June 30, 1999, Sport-Haley informed personnel at LH&M that WIP inventory had reached 
approximately $2.1 million.  LeCrone participated     in instituting measures that improperly 
minimized the impact on the companys gross ma rgin, kept the 1998 financial statements intact, 
and ratably eliminated the overstatement during the course of the 2000 fiscal year.   
 
       4.     With LeCrones participation, Sport-Haley estimated the proper amount of WIP 
inventory as of June 30, 1999 to  be approximately $370,000, purp ortedly leaving an overstated 
balance of approximately $1.7 million.  The company then wrote off approximately $560,000 of the 
$1.7 million to cost of goods sold.  Sport-Haley moved the remaining $1.2 million of the overstated 
inventory balances to a new inventory account that was to be amortized over the course of the 2000 
fiscal year, at approximately $100,000 monthly.  These entries lacked sufficient accounting basis.  
LeCrone, as an audit manager responsible for the performance of parts of LHMs audit of Sport-
Haleys 1999 financial statements, failed to perform sufficient audit procedures to verify how much 
WIP inventory should be properly recorded in the companys 1999 year-end financial statements.  
Moreover, LeCrone was reckless in not knowing  that the WIP inventory adjustments made by 
Sport-Haley were not in accordance with gene  rally accepted accounting principles and were 
misleading. 
        
       5.     Sport-Haley did not disclose the WIP i nventory error or explain the companys 
measures to adjust the financial statements for the WIP inventory error in its 1999 Form 10-K or 
Forms 10-Q for the companys first three quarters of its 2000 fiscal year.2
                                                                           Even though LeCrone 
should have known of the overstated WIP inventor y account balance at the end of fiscal 1999, 
LHM issued an audit report containing an unqua     lified opinion on Sport- Haleys fiscal 1999 
financial statements.  LeCrone also failed to   notify Sport-Haleys aud it committee that Sport-
Haleys 1999 financial statements and quarterly report for the first quarter of its 2000 fiscal year 
were materially misstated.    As a result of the companys improper accounting for the WIP 
inventory error, Sport-Haley filed its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999, including 
financial statements that, as a result of the   accounting involving the WIP  inventory, materially 
overstated finished goods inventory by over $1.2 million or 10 percent of total inventory. 
 
              Improper Accounting for Period Costs 
 
       6.     Prior to July 1, 1997, Sport-Haley began materially understating expenses related to 
product design, tradeshows, logo disks, property taxes and advertising by improperly deferring 
these costs as prepaid and fixed assets.  Howeve r, Sport-Haleys capitalization of several prepaid 
and fixed assets was not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  As an in-
charge staff accountant for the fiscal 1998 audit a nd an audit manager for  the fiscal 1999 audit, 
LeCrone was responsible for the audit procedures and reviewing workpapers relating to Sport-

                                                 
2
   LeCrone resigned from LHM in November 1999 and had no involvement with Sport-Haleys 
second or third fiscal quarter Forms 10-Q.  
                                               3 
---------------------Page 4---------------------

Haleys period costs.  However, LHMs audit workpapers contained insuff  icient accounting basis 
for Sport-Haleys treatment of period costs, and  LeCrone failed adequately  to review the fiscal 
1999 audit workpapers relating to period costs.  Moreover, during the 1999 audit, LeCrone failed 
to ensure that all work performed by junior   personnel regarding many of the period costs was 
reviewed adequately and complied with generally accepted auditing standards.  LeCrone allowed 
Sport-Haley to improperly capitalize period costs and caused Sport-Haley materially to overstate 
its income by $164,000 or four percent of pretax income in its 1998 Form 10-K for the fiscal year 
ended June 30, 1998, and $159,000 or 11.5 percent in its 1999 Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended 
June 30, 1999. 
 
              Improper Accounting for Discontinued Headwear Operations 
 
       7.     In a May 28, 1999 press release, Sport-Haley announced it was discontinuing its 
headwear product line at the end of its 1999 fiscal  year and that the sale of headwear equipment 
from the discontinued operations would result  in an estimated $160,000 loss.  After issuing the 
May 1999 press release, Sport-Haley revised the estimated loss on disposal of headwear equipment 
to $298,000 and recorded the loss in its books. 
                                                Before the audit fieldwork was completed, the 
company reversed $206,000 of the loss without sufficient accounting support.   
        
       8.     LeCrone, who reviewed audit procedures on Sport-Haleys discontinued headwear 
operations, failed to perform or direct others to perform sufficient procedures to substantiate the 
estimated loss on disposal of headwear equipment.  Although LeCrone had sufficient information 
to know Sport-Haley anticipated significantly larger losses, he allowed Sport-Haley to record only 
$92,000 loss related to the headwear equipment in its 1999 Form 10-K filed with the Commission.  
By failing to recognize the estimated loss on disposal of headwear equipment in conformity with 
generally accepted accounting principles, Sport-Haley understated its 1999 pretax loss on disposal 
of assets by $206,000 or 69.1 percent of pretax loss. 
 
              Post-Audit Supplementation of Work Papers  
 
       9.          On November 13, 2000, the Commission staff sent a letter to LHM requesting that 
it produce documents related to LHMs audits of   Sport-Haley.  At the  time, LHM was in the 
process of conducting an intern  al review of the fiscal 1999    Sport-Haley audit workpapers 
(November 2000 review).  Although LeCrone had resigned from LHM twelve months 
previously, he agreed to assist LHM in re  sponding to review comments developed by LHM 
personnel in connection with the November      2000 review.  LeCrone participated in adding 
explanatory language and analytical information to LHMs workpapers, most of which were dated 
as of the dates LeCrone made the addition in  November 2000, concerni ng the accounting areas 
Sport-Haley restated including WIP inventory, discontinued operations, and prepaid expenses.

C. Violations     
        
       10.       Section 17(a) of the Securities Act makes it unlawful to employ any device, 
scheme, or artifice to defraud in the offer or sale of any securities.  Section 10(b) of the Exchange 
Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder prohibit a person, in  connection with the pur chase or sale of a 
security, from making an untrue statement of a material fact or from omitting to state a material 
fact necessary to make statements made, in lig  ht of the circumstances under which they were 
made, not misleading.  To establish violations   of Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act and 
Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 1    0b-5 thereunder (the antifraud provisions), a 
defendant must act with scienter, Aaron v. SEC  , 446 U.S. 680, 695, 701- 02 (1980), which the 
Supreme Court has defined as "a mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud," 
Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder , 425 U.S. 185, 193  n.12 (1976).  Scienter  may be established by 
reckless conduct.  Hackbart v. Holmes, 675 F.2d 1114, 1117  (10th Cir. 1982); Anixter v. Home-
Stake Production, 77 F.3d 1215, 1225-1227 (10   th
                                                  Cir. 1996) (violation of antifraud provisions to 
prepare and certify financial statements auditor knows or is reckless in not knowing, are false).   
        
       11.        As a result of actions taken by LeCrone, as described above, in connection with the 
audits of Sport-Haleys financial statements    for the 1998 and 1999 fi    scal years, LeCrone 
participated in causing Sport-Haley to file quarterly and annual reports with the Commission that 
materially misstated and misrepresented Spor     t-Haleys financial condition and results of 
operations.  By his conduct described above, LeCrone committed and caused violations of Section 
17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  
        
       12.        Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act and Rules 15d-1 and 15d-13 thereunder require 
issuers with securities registered under the Securities Act to file quarterly and annual reports with 
the Commission and to keep this information current.  The obligation to file such reports embodies 
the requirement that they be true and correct. See, e.g., SEC v. Savoy Indus., Inc., 587 F.2d 1149, 
1165 (D.C. Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 913 (1979).  In add ition, Rule 12b-20 requires that 
reports contain such further material informat  ion as may be necessary to make the required 
statements, in light of the circumstances unde  r which they were made  , not misleading.  No 
showing of scienter is required to establish a violation of these provisions.  Savoy Indus., 587 F.2d 
at 1167.   
        
       13.       As discussed above, in  connection with LHMs audits of Sport-Haleys financial 
statements for the 1998 and 1999 fiscal years, Sport-Haley filed, and LeCrone caused Sport-Haley 
to file, annual and quarterly reports with the Commission that misrepresented the financial results of 
Sport-Haley, materially misstating income, WIP inventory, period costs, and discontinued headwear 
operations.  By his conduct described above, LeCrone caused Sport-Haleys violations of Section 
15(d) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 15d-1 and 15d-13 thereunder.

       D. Findings 
        
       Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that LeCrone willfully violated and caused 
violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 
10b-5 thereunder and that he willfully aided and abetted and caused violations of Section 15(d) of 
the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 15d-1 and 15d-13 promulgated thereunder.  
 
                                               IV. 
                                                  
       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in LeCrones Offer. 
 
       Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that: 
 
       A.     LeCrone shall cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any 
future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 
10b-5 promulgated thereunder; and from causing an  y violations and any future violations of 
Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 15d-1 and 15d-13 promulgated thereunder. 
 
       B.     LeCrone is denied the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission 
as an accountant. 
 
       C.     After two years from the date of this       order, LeCrone may request that the 
Commission consider his reinstatement by submitting an application (attention: Office of the Chief 
Accountant) to resume appearing or practicing before the Commission as: 
      
                           1.           a preparer or reviewer, or a person responsible for the preparation or 
review, of any public companys financial stat ements that are filed  with the Commission. 
Such an application must satisfy the Commission that LeCrones work in his practice before 
the Commission will be reviewed either by th e independent audit committee of the public 
company for which he  works or in some other acceptable  manner, as long as he practices 
before the Commission in this capacity; and/or 
      
                          2.         an independent accountant.  Such an application must satisfy the 
Commission that: 
      
                            (a)          LeCrone, or the public accounting firm with which he is 
              associated, is registered with the   Public Company Accounting Oversight 
              Board (Board) in accordance with  the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and 
              such registration continues to be effective; 
                    
                           (b)         LeCrone, or the registered public accounting firm with 
              which he is associated, has been insp ected by the Board and that inspection 
              did not identify any criticisms of or potential defects in the Respondents or 

                                                6

                the firms quality control system that would indicate that the respondent will 
                not receive appropriate supervision;  

                          (c)        LeCrone has resolved all disciplinary issues with the Board, 
                and has complied with all terms and c onditions of any sanctions imposed by 
                the Board (other than reinstatement by the Commission); and 
                 
                             (d)       LeCrone acknowledges his re       sponsibility, as long as he 
                appears or practices before the Commission as an independent accountant, to 
                comply with all requirements of th e Commission and the Board, including, 
                but not limited to, all requirements re          lating to registration, inspections, 
                concurring partner reviews and quality control standards.   
    
              D.          The Commission will consider an application by LeCrone to resume appearing 
or practicing before the Commission provided that his state CPA license is current and he has 
resolved all other disciplinary issues with th          e applicable state boar  ds of accountancy.  
However, if state licensure is dependan            t on reinstatement by         the Commission, the 
Commission will consider an application on its other merits. The Commissions review may 
include consideration of, in addition to th        e matters referenced above, any other matters 
relating to Respondents character, integrity, professional conduct, or qualifications to appear 
or practice before the Commission. 
 
 By the Commission.
