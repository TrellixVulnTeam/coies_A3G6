                                               III. 
 
                                                                                1
       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds  that:  
 
                                            Summary 

       MusclePharm Corporation (“MSLP”) is a Denver-based sports nutrition company that 
develops, manufactures, and markets sports nutrition products.  When MSLP became a public 
company in 2010, it was unprepared for the Commission’s reporting requirements and lacked 
sufficient infrastructure to support its rapid growth.  MSLP’s revenues greatly increased each year 
(MSLP’s reported revenue was $3M in 2010, $17M in 2011, $67M in 2012 and $111M in 2013).  
MSLP’s senior management lacked public company or accounting experience.  While the 
company focused on revenue growth, it failed to establish sufficient internal controls and keep 
proper books and records.  From July 2012 through April 10, 2014, Prosser was a member of 
MSLP’s board of directors and chair of the audit committee.  Beginning in September 2012, 
Prosser, the board of directors and members of senior management had reason to know that MSLP 
had not disclosed certain perquisite compensation paid to its executive officers.  Prosser, however, 
knew or should have known that he signed materially false and misleading filings with the 
Commission that failed to disclose all perquisites MSLP was required to disclose under the 
securities laws.  By summer 2013, MSLP began an internal review to determine the amount of 
undisclosed perquisites paid by MSLP to its executives since 2010.  In July 2013, Prosser became 
directly involved in MSLP’s internal perquisite review.  MSLP nevertheless continued to make 
filings with the Commission that materially understated perquisite compensation through July 
2014.    

                                           Respondent 

       1.      Donald W. Prosser, CPA, age 64, a resident of Denver, Colorado, was a member of 
the MSLP board of directors from July 2012 through April 10, 2014.  As an independent member 
of the MSLP board of directors, Prosser served as chair of the audit committee, a member of the 
compensation committee, and a member of the nominating and governance committee.  From 
April 10, 2014 through March 2, 2015, Prosser served as interim chief financial officer (“CFO”) of 
MSLP.  Prosser has been licensed as a certified public accountant (“CPA”) in Colorado since 1977, 
except for the three year period from June 1, 1998 to June 26, 2001. 
        
                                         Relevant Entity 
        
       2.      MSLP is a Nevada corporation, based in Denver, Colorado, that manufactures and 
markets sports nutrition products.  From 2010 to present, MSLP’s common stock was registered 
with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and was quoted on the OTC 
Bulletin Board.

       The findings herein are made purs  uant to Respondent's Offer of Settlement and are not 
binding on any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

               Prosser’s Role in MSLP’s Executive Compensation Disclosures 
        
       3.      In September 2012, according to the MSLP board minutes, Prosser attended a 
meeting of the MSLP board of directors and compensation committee.  During the meeting, the 
MSLP board of directors determined perquisites related to autos, golf club memberships, and 
private plane usage would be disclosed in Commission filings.  MSLP, however, filed several 
Commission filings in the form of Forms 10-K and Forms S-1, as well as amendments thereto, 
through July 2014, which failed to include complete disclosure of the perquisites identified at the 
September 2012 board meeting and otherwise known by senior management.  Prosser signed these 
filings as a director. 

       4.      On January 4, 2013, Prosser attended a meeting of the MSLP Compensation 
Committee of the board of directors.  During the meeting, it was resolved that the cost of the use of 
a private plane from non-employee relatives of MSLP officers in 2012 would be imputed to the 
executives.  MSLP, however, filed several Commission filings in the form of Forms 10-K and 
Forms S-1, as well as amendments thereto, through March 2014, which failed to include 
perquisites related to officer spousal use of a private plane in 2012.  Prosser signed these filings as 
a director. 

       5.      By summer 2013, MSLP began an internal review of its records to determine the 
amount of undisclosed perquisites paid by MSLP to its executives since 2010.  MSLP’s CFO 
began this review and in July identified over $100,000 of undisclosed perquisites, including jet use, 
autos, and golf club memberships and informed Prosser of the amount of undisclosed perquisites 
located to date. 

       6.      In July 2013, the audit committee, with Prosser as its chair, became directly 
involved in MSLP’s perquisite review process.  MSLP hired an outside consultant to perform a 
factual review of documents and information related to potential perquisites.  MSLP, however, 
filed a Form S-1 in August 2013 with incorrect perquisite disclosures that were identical to 
amounts previously disclosed before the internal review.  Prosser signed this filing as a director. 

       7.      After the August Form S-1 was filed, Prosser assisted and supervised the 
independent consultant in connection with his review of perquisites.  Prosser also approved the 
independent consultant’s work plan and consulted with the independent consultant during the 
review.   

       8.      In December 2013, MSLP stopped using the independent consultant.  The board 
approved and MSLP hired an internal auditor and assigned the perquisite review to the internal 
auditor.  Prosser assisted and supervised the work of the internal auditor and consulted with the 
internal auditor during the review.  

       9.      On March 31, 2014, MSLP filed its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 
2013.  Prosser approved and signed this filing.  The 2013 Form 10-K included a revised executive 
compensation table for the years 2011-2013.  In the table, MSLP set forth previously undisclosed 
perquisites for 2011 and 2012 totaling approximately $189,000 ($73,000 for 2011 and $115,000 

                                                3  
---------------------Page 4---------------------

for 2012).  The table also disclosed approximately $130,000 of perquisites in 2013.  These 
disclosures, however, still significantly understated perquisites paid to MSLP executives. 

       10.    On April 14, 2014, Prosser resigned from the MSLP board, including as a member 
of the audit committee as its chair, and became MSLP’s interim CFO.   

       11.    On July 23, 2014, MSLP filed a Definitive Proxy Statement, which included the 
same deficient perquisite disclosure as the 2013 Form 10-K. 

       12.    MSLP and its audit committee reexamined its perquisite investigation results from 
spring 2014 through fall 2014.  On October 31, 2014, MSLP filed amended Forms 10-K for the 
years ended 2012 and 2013.  Prosser signed these filings as the Principal Financial Officer and 
Principal Accounting Officer.  The 2013 Form 10-K/A disclosed approximately $252,000 of 
additional perquisites for the years 2011, 2012, and 2013 that were not included in the 2013 Form 
10-K or MSLP’s July 2014 proxy statement.  The 2012 Form 10-K/A disclosed approximately 
$37,000 of additional perquisites for 2010.  In total, MSLP failed to report perquisites totaling 
approximately $482,000 from 2010-2013. 

       13.    Because MSLP did not properly identify and record perquisites paid to its 
executives, MSLP’s books, records and accounts did not, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly 
reflect its transactions and dispositions of assets and its filings with the Commission were 
materially false and misleading. 
        
                                           Violations 
 
       14.    As a result of the conduct described above, Prosser caused MSLP’s violations of 
Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 thereunder, which prohibits solicitations by 
means of a proxy statement, form of proxy, notice of meeting or other communication, written or 
oral, containing a statement which, at the time and in the light of the circumstances under which it 
was made, was false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or which omitted to state any 
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not false or misleading or necessary 
to correct any statement in any earlier communication with respect to the solicitation of a proxy for 
the same meeting or subject matter which has become false or misleading. 
        
       15.    As a result of the conduct described above, Prosser caused MSLP’s violations of 
Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act Rules 13a-1 and 12b-20 thereunder, which require every issuer 
of a security registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act file with the Commission 
information, documents, and annual and quarterly reports as the Commission may require, and 
mandate that periodic reports contain such further material information as may be necessary to 
make the required statements not misleading.  
        
       16.    As a result of the conduct described above, Prosser caused MSLP’s violations of 
Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act, which requires reporting companies to make and keep 
books, records and accounts, which in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect their 
transactions and dispositions of assets.
