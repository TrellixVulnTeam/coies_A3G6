Confessore (“Confessore”) pursuant to Sections 4C      and  21C of the Securities Exchang e Act of

        In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (“Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the purpose of 
these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the Commission, or to 
which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings herein, except as 
to the Commission’s jurisdiction over them and the subject matter of these proceedings, which are 
admitted, and except as provided herein in Section V, Respondent consents to the entry of this

                                                  III.

        On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds  that: 
  
A.  SUMMARY 
         
        Confessore violated the auditor independence rules for 7 audit and review engagements of 
three public company clients in 2012-2013 on account of employment, business, or financial 
relationships either he or his partners had with those three clients.  In 2012, Confessore was the 
engagement quality review partner for DKM Certified Public Accountants, Inc.’s (“DKM’s”) audits 
or interim reviews of annual and quarterly financial statements of Issuer A and Issuer B.  At the 
same time he performed this work, he worked for Issuer A’s and B’s Chief Financial Officer 
(“CFO”), Peter Messineo, at Messineo’s own audit firm, Messineo & Co., CPAs, LLC (“Messineo 
& Co.”). 
 
        Near the end of 2012, Messineo resigned as CFO of Issuer A and Issuer B and became a 
shareholder and partner at DKM.  Despite Messineo joining DKM, Confessore continued in 2013 to 
conduct engagement quality reviews of financial statements of Issuer A and Issuer B for DKM even 
though:  (1) the companies’ former CFO was now his partner at DKM and in a position to influence 
the audits and reviews, and (2) Messineo had been CFO during the audit periods covered by his 
review.  In addition, in 2013 when Confessore performed the engagement quality reviews for DKM 

                                                                                                                                                             
 
        Rule 102(e)(1)(iii) provides, in pertinent part, that: 
 
                The Commission may . . . deny, temporarily or permanently, the privilege of appearing or 
                practicing before it . . . to any person who is found…to have willfully violated, or willfully aided 
                and abetted the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or the rules and 
                regulations thereunder. 
 
3
        The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent's Offer of Settlement and are not binding on any 
        other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.  
 

                                                   2

of Issuer A and Issuer B, he knew that Messineo -- his partner at DKM -- had a direct financial 
relationship with both Issuer A and Issuer B.  Messineo owned stock in both companies.   
        
       Lastly, in 2013, DKM audited Issuer C’s annual financial statement covering the period 
from April 1, 2011 – March 31, 2012.  Confessore participated in the audit despite having served as 
Issuer C’s CFO during the audit period. 
        
       Performing these audits and reviews for Issuer A, Issuer B, and Issuer C violated the 
independence rules of the Federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.  
Confessore also caused Issuer A, Issuer B, and Issuer C to file false or misleading reports with the 
Commission in violation of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 
promulgated thereunder.  Confessore’s conduct was willful and constitutes improper professional 
conduct.   
        
B.  RESPONDENT 

       Richard Confessore, age 73, resides in Sarasota, Florida and has been a licensed Certified 
Public Accountant (“CPA”) in Florida since 1970.  Confessore is currently a Director and “Quality 
Review Partner” at DKM.  During 2011, Confessore was the CFO and worked at Issuer C.  During 
2012-2013, Confessore performed engagement quality reviews for the annual audits and interim 
reviews DKM performed for Issuers A and B.  In addition, from June 2012 – December 2012, 
Confessore was an employee of Messineo & Co, then a sole proprietorship owned by Peter 
Messineo (who was also the CFO for both Issuer A and Issuer B).   
 
C.  OTHER RELEVANT PARTIES 
        
       Issuer A was incorporated in Delaware in 2005 and is currently headquartered in California.  
During 2012 and 2013, Issuer A’s common stock was registered with the Commission pursuant to 
Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act.  In its most recent Form 10-K filed with the Commission, 
Issuer A states that its business “offers marketing tools and expertise to advertisers.”  From 
February 2010 – November 2012, Messineo served as CFO of Issuer A.  In 2012 and 2013, Issuer 
A engaged DKM to perform audit services.       
        
       Issuer B was incorporated in Nevada in 2004 and is currently headquartered in St. 
Petersburg, FL.  During 2012 and 2013, Issuer B’s common stock was registered with the 
Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act.  In its most recent Form 10-K filed 
with the Commission, Issuer B states that its business “creates a unified solution path to securely 
manage Advanced Metering Infrastructure and other Smart Grid optimization applications such as 
substation and distribution automation.”  From September 2010 – October 2012, Messineo served 
as CFO of Issuer B.  In 2012 and 2013, Issuer B engaged DKM to perform audit services. 

       Issuer C was incorporated in Colorado in 1981.  Currently, it is a Florida corporation 
headquartered in Southbury, CT.  During 2012 and 2013, Issuer C’s common stock was registered 
with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act.  In its most recent Form 10-K 
filed with the Commission, Issuer C states that its business consists of “operating motor freight 
carriers, providing truck load service throughout the forty-eight contiguous United States.”  

                                                3  
---------------------Page 4---------------------

Confessore resigned as CFO of Issuer C on April 12, 2011.  In 2012, Issuer C engaged Messineo & 
Co to provide audit services.  Messineo & Co. did not issue an audit report before DKM was 
formed.  In 2013, Issuer C then engaged DKM to provide audit services for the same period for 
which Messineo & Co. had been retained.   
 
       DKM Certified Public Accountants, Inc. (“DKM”) is registered with the Public 
Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) as a public accounting firm based in 
Clearwater, Florida.  DKM is a Florida corporation and successor to audit firms:  (i) Drake Klein & 
Messineo CPAs PA; and (ii) Drake & Klein, CPAs PA (“Drake & Klein”).  In December 2012, 
when Peter Messineo joined DKM, the firm changed its operational name from Drake & Klein to 
DKM.  As of December 2012, DKM had four partners authorized to issue audit reports on behalf 
of the firm, including Messineo, Confessore, and Charles Klein.   

       Charles U. Klein, age 60, resides in Dunedin, Florida and is currently President of DKM.  
From approximately February 2012 through June 2013, Klein was the lead engagement partner for 
the services DKM performed for Issuer A, Issuer B, and Issuer C.   These services included annual 
audits and interim reviews of the financial statements of Issuer A, Issuer B, and Issuer C.  Klein 
has been a licensed CPA in Florida since 1985, excluding 1995 – 1998 when his license was 
inactive. 
        
       Peter Messineo, age 54, resides in Palm Harbor, Florida and is currently a partner at and 
95% owner of Messineo & Co., which is a PCAOB-registered public accounting firm based in 
Clearwater, Florida.  In 2012, he was the sole owner of Messineo & Co. (then named “Peter 
Messineo, CPA”) and CFO of Issuer A and Issuer B.  From December 17, 2012 – April 16, 2013, 
Messineo was a partner and one-third owner of DKM and a shareholder of Issuer A and Issuer B 
stock.   Messineo has been licensed as a CPA in New York since 1989 and in Florida since 2007.   
        
D.  IN 2012, CONFESSORE CAUSED DKM (THEN KNOWN AS DRAKE & KLEIN) 
    NOT TO BE INDEPENDENT BY POSSESSING A BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP 
    WITH THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER OF DKM’S AUDIT CLIENTS. 
        
   1.     Issuer A engaged DKM to perform interim reviews for the quarters ending June 30, 
          2012 (Form 10-Q filed August 14, 2012) and September 30, 2012 (Form 10-Q filed 
          November 14, 2012).  Klein was DKM’s lead engagement partner and Confessore was 
          DKM’s engagement quality review (“EQR”) partner on these engagements. 
    
   2.     During the audit and professional engagement periods for these Issuer A engagements, 
          Messineo was Issuer A’s CFO.  
    
   3.     Issuer B engaged DKM to perform audit services for the annual period ending June 30, 
          2012 (Form 10-K filed October 15, 2012) and the quarter ending September 30, 2012 
          (Form 10-Q filed November 14, 2012).  Klein was DKM’s lead engagement partner and 
          Confessore was DKM’s EQR partner on these engagements. 
    
   4.     During the audit and professional engagement periods for these Issuer B engagements, 
          Messineo was Issuer B’s CFO.  
                                             4  
---------------------Page 5---------------------

    
   5.     In June 2012, Messineo hired Confessore to work for him at Messineo & Co.  
           Confessore worked at Messineo & Co. until mid-December 2012.  Thus, Confessore 
           worked under Messineo -- the Chief Financial Officer of both Issuer A and Issuer B -- 
           at the same time Confessore conducted engagement quality reviews for DKM of:  (i) 
           Issuer A’s interim financial statements filed August 14, 2012 and November 14, 
           2012; (ii) and Issuer B’s annual financial statement filed October 15, 2012 (amended 
           October 22, 2012).  Confessore also worked for Messineo during the entire audit 
           period of Issuer B’s interim financial statements, filed November 14, 2012, which 
           DKM and Confessore reviewed.    
    
   6.     Rule 2-01(b) of Regulation S-X (Qualifications of Accountants) states that the 
           “Commission will not recognize an accountant as independent, with respect to an audit 
           client, if the accountant is not…capable of exercising objective and impartial judgment 
           on all issues encompassed within the accountant's engagement.”  17 CFR §210.2-01. 
    
   7.     Rule 2-01(c) (3) states certain “business relationships” are inconsistent with 
           independence:  
        
                  Business Relationships.  An accountant is not independent if, at any 
                  point during the audit and professional engagement period, the 
                  accounting firm or any covered person in the firm has any direct or 
                  material indirect business relationship with an audit client, or with 
                  persons associated with the audit client in a decision-making capacity, 
                  such as an audit client’s officers, directors, or substantial stockholders. 
                   
           17 CFR §210.2-01(c)(3). 
            
   8.     Confessore’s employment with Messineo constituted an improper business 
           relationship and conflict of interest.     
 
   9.     Rule 2-01(f)(11) defines “covered person” to include partners, principals, 
           shareholders, and employees of an accounting firm on the “audit engagement team.”  
           17 CFR §210.2-01(f)(11).  The “audit engagement team” includes the “concurring or 
           reviewing partner.”  17 CFR §210.2-01(f)(7)(ii)(B).    
    
   10.    PCAOB standards also require auditor independence.  PCAOB Rule 3520 (Auditor 
           Independence) requires that, “[a] registered public accounting firm and its associated 
           persons must be independent of the firm’s audit client throughout the audit and 
           professional engagement period.” 
    
   11.    PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 7 (Engagement Quality Review) requires that “an 
           engagement quality reviewer must have competence, independence, integrity, and 
           objectivity.”  See PCAOB AS 7.4. 
        

                                               5  
---------------------Page 6---------------------

   12.    Confessore and DKM were not independent of Issuer A and Issuer B with respect to 
          DKM’s audit and interim reviews of financial statements filed from August 2012 
          through November 2012 because Confessore -- the engagement quality reviewer -- had 
          a direct business relationship with Messineo -- the CFO of clients Issuer A and Issuer B 
          -- during DKM’s audit and professional engagement periods.  See Rule 2-01(c)(3) of 
          Regulation S-X; see also PCAOB AS 7 and PCAOB Rule 3520. 
        
E.     IN 2013, CONFESSORE FAILED TO MAINTAIN PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS 
       BY PERFORMING ENGAGEMENT QUALITY REVIEWS WHEN HE AND DKM 
       LACKED INDEPENDENCE. 
        
   13.    Messineo resigned as CFO of Issuer A effective November 15, 2012 and as CFO of 
          Issuer B effective October 30, 2012. 
    
   14.    In mid-December 2012, Messineo joined DKM.  Messineo was a one-third owner of 
          DKM.  While not a shareholder, Confessore was a partner authorized to issue audit 
          reports on behalf of DKM.    
    
   15.    Issuer A engaged DKM to perform audit services for the annual period ending 
          December 31, 2012 (Form 10-K filed April 15, 2013).  Klein was DKM’s lead 
          engagement partner and Confessore was DKM’s engagement quality review partner on 
          this engagement.   
    
   16.    Issuer B engaged DKM to perform interim review services for the quarter ending 
          December 31, 2012 (Form 10-Q filed February 19, 2013).  Klein was DKM’s lead 
          engagement partner and Confessore was DKM’s engagement quality review partner on 
          this engagement.   
    
   17.    PCAOB AS 7 requires that “an engagement quality reviewer must have competence, 
          independence, integrity, and objectivity.”  See PCAOB AS 7.4 (emphasis added). 
        
   18.    Confessore lacked independence from Issuer A and Issuer B because Messineo, his 
          partner at DKM, had financial and employment relationships with Issuer A and Issuer 
          B.   
    
   19.    Rule 2-01(c) (1) (Financial Relationships) states that an accountant is not 
          independent if, at any point during the audit and professional engagement period, the 
          accountant has a “direct financial interest” in the accountant’s audit client, including 
          when:  
        
              A.  The accounting firm [or] any covered person in the firm…has any 
                 direct investment in an audit client, such as stocks, bonds, notes, 
                 options, or other securities. 
 
                                   *      *      * 

                                             6  
---------------------Page 7---------------------

               B.  Any partner, principal, shareholder, or professional employee of the 
                  accounting firm…has filed a Schedule 13D…with the Commission 
                  indicating beneficial ownership of more than five percent of an audit 
                  client’s securities 
                   
           17 CFR §210.2-01(c)(1)(i)(A)-(B). 
 
   20.    Rule 2-01(f)(11) defines “covered person” to include any “other partner, principal, or 
           shareholder from an ‘office’ of the accounting firm in which the lead audit 
           engagement partner primarily practices in connection with the audit.”  17 CFR 
           §210.2-01(f)(11).  “Office” means “a distinct sub-group within an accounting firm, 
           whether distinguished along geographic or practice lines.”  17 CFR §210.2-01(f)(15). 
    
   21.    Rule 2-01(c) (2) (Employment Relationships) states that an accountant is not 
           independent if, at any point during the audit and professional engagement period, the 
           accountant has an “employment relationship” with an audit client, including when: 
        
               A former officer, director, or employee of an audit client becomes a 
               partner, principal, shareholder, or professional employee of the accounting 
               firm, unless the individual does not participate in, and is not in a position 
               to influence, the audit of the financial statements of the audit covering any 
               period during which he or she was employed by or associated with that 
               audit client. 
        
           17 CFR §210.2-01(2)(iv) Employment at Accounting Firm of Former Employee of 
           Audit Client.   
            
   22.    From December 2012 to April 2013, Messineo worked at DKM’s small office in 
           Clearwater, Florida along with Klein and approximately 6-8 staff personnel.  Messineo’s 
           office was less than 10 feet away from the offices of those providing audit services to 
           Issuer A and Issuer B.   
    
   23.    From December 2012 to April 2013, Messineo had access to all of DKM’s audit files, 
           including those for the audit of Issuer A and the interim review of Issuer B.  Messineo 
           supervised the audit staff at DKM, including the audit manager who worked on the 
           Issuer A audit, in some of DKM’s other engagements. 
    
   24.    During a significant portion of the professional engagement period for DKM’s audit of 
           Issuer A, Messineo possessed Issuer A’s books and records.  
    
   25.    During Messineo’s tenure as a shareholder and partner at DKM, he owned stock in 
           DKM’s clients Issuer A and Issuer B.  As of April 15, 2013, when Issuer A’s Form 10-K 
           was filed, Messineo owned approximately 6% of the outstanding shares of Issuer A’s 
           stock.   
    

                                                7

   26.    Confessore knew Messineo owned stock in Issuer A and Issuer B during the audit and 
           professional engagement periods for those clients.  Despite his knowledge, he performed 
           the EQR for DKM’s audit of Issuer A and review of Issuer B without objection and 
           consented to the issuance of DKM’s audit report. 
    
   27.    Confessore caused DKM to not be independent of Issuer A and Issuer B with respect to 
           their public filings made in February 2013 and April 2013 because Messineo -- a 
           partner and shareholder of DKM -- possessed a direct financial interest (stock 
           ownership) in clients Issuer A and Issuer B during DKM’s audit and professional 
           engagement periods.  See Rule 2-01(c)(1) of Regulation S-X; see also PCAOB AS 7.4.        
    
   28.    Confessore caused DKM to not be independent of Issuer A and Issuer B with respect to 
           their public filings made in February 2013 and April 2013 because Messineo -- a partner 
           and shareholder of DKM -- was the CFO of Issuer A and Issuer B during the audit 
           period and in a position to influence DKM’s audit and interim review.  See Rule 2-
           01(c)(2) of Regulation S-X; see also PCAOB AS 7.4.        
 
F.     IN 2013, CONFESSORE CAUSED DKM NOT TO BE INDEPENDENT BY 
       PARTICIPATING IN AN AUDIT OF HIS FORMER EMPLOYER.  
 
   29.    Confessore was the CFO of Issuer C until April 12, 2011.  Following his resignation, 
           Confessore made himself available to Issuer C on a part-time basis to assist with 
           accounting matters.  On June 29, 2011, Issuer C filed a “Notification of Late Filing” for 
           its Form 10-K.  The notification explained that Issuer C was unable to complete its 
           accounting at the subsidiary level.  Issuer C’s notification identified Confessore as the 
           person to contact in regard to the notification. 
    
   30.    In 2012, Issuer C engaged Messineo & Co. to perform audit services for the period from 
           April 1, 2011 – March 31, 2012.  Confessore performed work for Messineo & Co. 
           concerning Issuer C, including the period for which he had been CFO and/or worked for 
           Issuer C.  Messineo & Co. did not complete its audit or issue an audit report before 
           DKM was formed.   
    
   31.    In 2013, DKM agreed to audit Issuer C’s financial statements for the same period (April 
           1, 2011 – March 31, 2012) despite Confessore’s prior position as CFO of Issuer C 
           during that audit period.  DKM incorporated Messineo & Co.’s work into its audit of 
           Issuer C, including Confessore’s work.  On behalf of DKM, Klein signed the 
           engagement report issued to Issuer C in June 2013.   
    
   32.    Confessore caused DKM to not be independent of DKM’s client Issuer C with respect to 
           its public filings made in June 2013 because Confessore – a partner of DKM – 
           participated in the audit of Issuer C, which covered the period Confessore had been the 
           CFO and/or worked for Issuer C.  See Rule 2-01(c)(2) of Regulation S-X. 
        

                                               8  
---------------------Page 9---------------------

   33.    Finally, Confessore failed to comply with PCAOB Interim Auditing Standard AU 230 
          (Due Professional Care in the Performance of Work).  AU 230.02 “requires the 
          independent auditor to plan and perform his or her work with due professional care.  
          Due professional care imposes a responsibility upon each professional within an 
          independent auditor's organization to observe the standards of field work and reporting.”  
          Confessore did not exercise due professional care when he performed EQRs while he 
          lacked independence. 
        
G.     CONFESSORE AIDED AND ABETTED AND CAUSED DKM TO VIOLATE 
       RULE 2-02 OF REGULATION S-X BECAUSE DKM'S AUDIT REPORTS DID 
       NOT COMPLY WITH PCAOB STANDARDS. 
        
   34.    Rule 2-02(b)(1) of Regulation S-X (Representations as to the Audit included in 
          Accountants' Reports) requires an accountant's report to state “whether the audit was 
          made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.”  17 CFR §210.2-02(b).  
          These standards include the standards of the PCAOB.  “[R]eferences in Commission 
          rules and staff guidance and in the federal securities laws to [generally accepted auditing 
          standards “GAAS”] or to specific standards under GAAS, as they related to issuers, 
          should be understood to mean the standards of the PCAOB plus any applicable rules of 
          the Commission.”  See SEC Release No. 34-49708. 
    
   35.    DKM issued audit reports for its audits of Issuer C, Issuer A, and Issuer B for fiscal 
          years ending March 31, 2012, December 31, 2012 and June 30, 2012, respectively.  
          Confessore was the engagement quality review partner for these audits.  The audit 
          reports incorrectly state that DKM “conducted [its] audit in accordance with the 
          standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).”   
    
   36.    DKM's audits were not conducted in accordance with PCAOB auditing standards 
          because the firm lacked independence as described above.  See PCAOB Rule 3520 
          (requiring independence); PCAOB AS 7.4 (same).  
    
   37.    Accordingly, Confessore aided and abetted and caused violations of Rule 2-02 of 
          Regulation S-X. 
  
H.     CONFESSORE CAUSED ISSUER A, ISSUER B, AND ISSUER C TO FILE FALSE 
       OR MISLEADING REPORTS WITH THE COMMISSION IN VIOLATION OF 
       SECTION 13(a) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT AND RULES 13a-1 AND 13a-13 
       THEREUNDER.   
        
   38.    Exchange Act Sections 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 require an issuer to file 
          accurate annual and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. Section 13(a) of the 
          Exchange Act also requires issuers file annual reports certified by “independent 
          public accountants,” and Rule 10-01(d) of Regulation S-X requires an “independent 
          public accountant” review an issuer’s interim financial statements before the issuer 
          files its Form 10-Q. 

                                             9  
---------------------Page 10---------------------

    
   39.    As a result of Confessore’s conduct, Issuer A, Issuer B, and Issuer C filed annual and 
           quarterly reports which had not been audited or reviewed by independent accountants in 
           violation of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13. 
 
I.      VIOLATIONS 
     
   40.     As a result of the conduct described above, Confessore willfully aided and abetted and 
           caused (i) issuers to violate Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 
           13a-13 promulgated thereunder, and (ii) DKM to violate Rule 2-02 of Regulation S-X.    
    
   41.     As a result of the conduct described above, Confessore engaged in improper 
           professional conduct as defined in Rule 102(e)(1)(iv) in that Confessore violated 
           applicable professional standards or committed repeated instances of unreasonable 
           negligent conduct each resulting in a violation of applicable professional standards that 
           indicate a lack of competence to practice before the Commission.  
        
J.      FINDINGS      
        
   42.    Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that Confessore engaged in improper 
           professional conduct pursuant to Section 4C(a)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rule 
           102(e)(1)(ii) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice. 
     
   43.    Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that Confessore willfully violated, or 
           willfully aided and abetted the violation of, a provision(s) of the Federal securities 
           laws or the rules and regulations thereunder pursuant to Section 4C(a)(2) of the 
           Exchange Act and Rule 102(e)(1)(iii) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice    . 
    
   44.    Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that Confessore:  willfully aided and 
           abetted and caused issuers to violate Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 
           and 13a-13 promulgated thereunder and DKM to violate Rule 2-02 of Regulation S-X.      

                                               IV. 
                                                  
       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in Respondent’s respective Offer. 
 
       Accordingly, pursuant to Sections 4C and 21C of the Exchange Act, it is hereby 
ORDERED, effective immediately, that: 
 
       A.     Confessore shall cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any 
future violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 promulgated 
thereunder, and Rule 2-02 of Regulation S-X. 
        
       B.      Confessore is denied the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission as 
an accountant. 

                                                10   
---------------------Page 11---------------------

 
       C.      After 2 years from the date of this order, Confessore may request that the 
Commission consider his reinstatement by submitting an application (attention: Office of the Chief 
Accountant) to resume appearing or practicing before the Commission as:   
        
       1.      a preparer or reviewer, or a person responsible for the preparation or review, of any 
               public company’s financial statements that are filed with the Commission.  Such an 
               application must satisfy the Commission that Confessore’s work in his practice 
               before the Commission will be reviewed either by the independent audit committee of 
               the public company for which he works or in some other acceptable manner, as long 
               as he practices before the Commission in this capacity; and/or  
                
       2.      an independent accountant.  Such an application must satisfy the Commission that:   
        
                  (a)  Confessore, or the public accounting firm with which he is associated, is 
                       registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“Board”) 
                       in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and such registration 
                       continues to be effective; 
                        
                  (b)  Confessore, or the registered public accounting firm with which he is 
                       associated, has been inspected by the Board and that inspection did not 
                       identify any criticisms of or potential defects in Confessore’s or the firm’s 
                       quality control system that would indicate that the Confessore’s will not 
                       receive appropriate supervision; 
  
                  (c)  Confessore has resolved all disciplinary issues with the Board, and has 
                       complied with all terms and conditions of any sanctions imposed by the 
                       Board (other than reinstatement by the Commission); and 
 
                  (d)  Confessore acknowledges his responsibility, as long as Confessore appears or 
                       practices before the Commission as an independent accountant, to comply 
                       with all requirements of the Commission and the Board, including, but not 
                       limited to, all requirements relating to registration, inspections, concurring 
                       partner reviews and quality control standards. 
 
       3.      The Commission will consider an application by Respondent to resume appearing or 
               practicing before the Commission provided that his CPA license is current and he 
               has resolved all other disciplinary issues with the applicable boards of accountancy.  
               However, if CPA licensure is dependent on reinstatement by the Commission, the 
               Commission will consider an application on its own merits.  The Commission’s 
               review may include consideration of, in addition to the matters referenced above, 
               any other matters relating to Respondent’s character, integrity, professional conduct,  
               or qualifications to appear or practice before the Commission.  
                
D.     Confessore shall within 14 days of the entry of this Order, pay a civil money penalty in the 
       amount of $15,000 to the Securities and Exchange Commission.  If timely payment is not 

                                                 11   
---------------------Page 12---------------------

       made, additional interest shall accrue pursuant to SEC Rule of Practice 600 and 31 U.S.C. § 
       3717.  Payment must be made in one of the following ways:   
 
              (1)     Respondent may transmit payment electronically to the Commission, which 
                      will provide detailed ACH transfer/Fedwire instructions upon request;  
               
              (2)     Respondent may make direct payment from a bank account via Pay.gov 
                      through the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ofm.htm; or  
               
              (3)    Respondent may pay by certified check, bank cashier’s check, or United 
                      States postal money order, made payable to the Securities and Exchange 
                      Commission and hand-delivered or mailed to:
