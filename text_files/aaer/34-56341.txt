                                           I. 
 
              The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) deems it appropriate that cease-
and-desist proceedings be, and he reby are, instituted pursuant to  Section 21C of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), against David A. Miller (Miller or Respondent).   
                                            
                                          II. 
 
              In anticipation of the institution of these  proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the Offer) whic h the Commission has determined  to accept.  Solely for the 
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings

proceedings, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Cease-

Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Order), as set forth below.

                                                 III. 
 
              On the basis of this Order and Respondents Offer, the Commission finds1
                                                                                     that:  
 
                            1.           Miller, age 36, is a resident of Houston, Texas.  During the relevant time 
period, Miller was the Chief Accounting Officer of Integrated Electrical Services, Inc. (IES).  
Among his duties, Miller was responsible for ensuring proper disclosure in IES's financial 
statements.  Miller is currently self employed.  From January 2005 to April 2007, Miller was the 
Chief Financial Officer of IES.  Miller is a licensed CPA in the State of Texas. 

               2.           IES is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Houston, Texas.  During the 
relevant time period, IES was a leading provider of electrical contracting services in the United 
States, whose shares were traded on the New York Stock Exchange and registered with the 
Commission under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act.   

                     3.           For the quarter ended June 30, 2003, the fiscal year ended September 30, 
2003, the quarter ended December 31, 2003, and the quarter ended March 31, 2004, IES failed to 
properly disclose material loss contingencies related to its accounts receivable.2
                                                                                     The loss 
contingencies surrounding IESs accounts receivable comprised approximately $3 million in 
revenues recorded on unsigned, disputed change orders from two electrical construction contracts 
at an IES subsidiary, Pan American Electric, Inc. (Pan Am).   
 
                     4.           In February 2000, Pan Am contracted with Centex Rodgers, Inc. (Centex) 
for work on construction of the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.  By the end of 2002, IES 
had recorded revenue of approximately $1.7 million based on work performed pursuant to 
unsigned change orders.  Centex later disputed payment on those change orders.  After 
negotiations, in June 2004 IES accepted $35,000 as payment in full and wrote-off the remaining 
balance associated with the disputed account receivable, approximately $1.7 million, with the 
agreement that Centex would continue to work with IES and its subsidiaries. 
 
                     5.           In June 2000, Pan Am contracted with Beers Skanska for work on 
construction of the Bay Medical Center Surgery/ER unit in Panama City, Florida.  By the end of 
2002, IES had recorded revenue of approximately $1.3 million based on work performed pursuant 
to unsigned change orders.  Beers Skanska later disputed payment on those change orders.  IES 
wrote down the value of the change orders by 50% in September 2004.  After negotiations and 
litigation, IES recovered $810,000 on the project in January 2005. 
 
                                                 
       1
         The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent's Offer of Settlement and are not binding 
on any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding. 
       2
         On August 29, 2007, the Commission filed a Complaint in the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, 
entitled SEC v. IES, et al. (Complaint), alleging that IES and certain individuals violated the federal securities laws.  
Simultaneous with the filing of the Complaint, without admitting or denying the allegations therein, IES agreed to the 
entry of a permanent injunction for violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and 
Rules 13a-1, 13a-13, and 12b-20 thereunder.  Miller is not a party to, or named as a defendant in, the Complaint. 
 
                                                  2

                            6.            Prior to writing down the value on the Vanderbilt and Bay Medical 
account receivables, IES failed to properly disclose the material loss contingencies that existed 
on the two projects.  Moreover, Miller failed to ensure IES's proper disclosure of these material 
loss contingencies. 
 
                      7.           IES maintained an allowance for doubtful accounts, which IES disclosed in 
its filings with the Commission.  Among other things, IESs disclosure states that the allowance 
maintained is subject to judgments and estimates, and the specific amount of the allowance was 
reflected quarterly and annually in IESs financial statements.  However, IES failed to properly 
disclose material changes in estimates for its allowance for doubtful accounts reserve when it 
lowered such reserve by nearly $2 million over the course of three consecutive quarters.     
                 
                            8.           During the quarters ended September 30, 2003, December 31, 2003, and 
March 31, 2004, IES changed the percentage basis for estimating the general portion of its 
uncollectible accounts receivable from approximately 1% down to 0.25%.  This resulted in IES 
reducing its allowance account and thereby increasing its pre-tax income by $550,000 for the 
quarter and fiscal year ended September 30, 2003, by $1.1 million for the quarter-ended December 
31, 2003, and by $200,000 for the quarter-ended March 31, 2004.  These reductions were material 
to IESs pre-tax income in each period.  However, IES failed to properly disclose that it had 
changed the percentage basis for its doubtful accounts.  Moreover, Miller failed to ensure IES's 
proper disclosure of the changes of the percentage basis for its doubtful accounts.        
  
                      9.           As a result of the conduct described above, Miller caused violations of 
Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1, 13a-13 and 12b-20 thereunder.   
  
                                                    IV. 
                                                       
        In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in Respondents Offer. 
 
        Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that Miller cease and desist from causing any 
violations and any future violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1, 13a-13, 
and 12b-20 thereunder.   
 
 By the Commission.
