                                                                       UNDER RULE 102(e)(5) OF THE 
JORDAN H. MINTZ                            :   COMMISSIONS RULES OF PRACTICE 
______________________________:                                                                                    
                                                                    
                                                        I. 
                                        
       On January 26, 2009, the Commission, pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(i) of its Rules of 
Practice, suspended attorney Jordan H. Mintz (Mintz) from appearing or practicing before the 
Commission as an attorney, with the right to apply to resume appearing and practicing after two 
years.  See        Opinion and Order, Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Release No. 2926 (January 26, 
2009).   As part of a separate consent judgment to resolve a related civil injunctive action 
brought by the Commission, Mintz was ordered by the U.S. District Court for the Southern 
District of Texas to pay a civil penalty of $25,000 and $1.00 disgorgement.  
        
                                                                                 II. 
        
       On or about January 27, 2011, more than two years after his suspension by the 
Commission, Mintz filed an application for reinstatement.     Mintz has paid the $25,000 civil 
penalty and $1.00 disgorgement in the related enforcement action.  As part of the reinstatement 
process, Mintz has sworn under penalty of perjury that he has complied with the Order, that he is 
not subject to any suspension or disbarment as an attorney by a court of the United States or of 
any state, territory, district, commonwealth, or possession, and that he has not been convicted of 
a felony or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude.  Since the entry of the Order, no information 
has come to the attention of the Commission relating to Mintzs character, integrity, professional 
conduct or qualifications to practice before the Commission that would be a basis for an adverse 
action against him pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commission's Rules of Practice.        

                                                 III.

        Based on the foregoing, the Commission has determined that it is appropriate to reinstate 
Mintz, pursuant to Rule 102(e)(5), to appear or practice as an attorney before the Commission.                 

 
        Accordingly, it is HEREBY ORDERED that Mintz may resume practicing as an attorney 
before the Commission. 

        By the Commission.
