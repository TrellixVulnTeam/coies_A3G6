In the Matter of                                          ORDER DENYING MOTION 
                                                          TO LIFT TEMPORARY SUSPENSION 
        STORMY L. DEAN                                    AND DIRECT HEARING 
         

 
 
        On October 24, 2012, we issued an order instituting proceedings against Stormy L. Dean 
                                                         1
pursuant to Commission Rule of Practice 102(e)(3)         that temporarily suspended him from 
                                                     2
appearing or practicing before    the Commission    .  

        The OIP alleges that   D ean  was  the chief financial officer  of infoUSA, Inc. from 
approximately   January 2000    through  September 2003 and January 2006 through December 
                                                                                                           3
2008 ,  and in that position certified infoUSA   ’s Forms 10-K that were filed with the Commission.          
                                                           
1
        Rule of Practice 102(e)(3)(i), 17 C.F.R. § 201.102(e)(3)(i), provides: 
 
        The Commission, with due regard to the public interest and without preliminary hearing, may, by order, 
        temporarily suspend from appearing or practicing before it any attorney, accountant, engineer, or other 
        professional or expert who has been by name: 
         
                (A) Permanently enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction, by reason of his or her 
                misconduct in an action brought by the Commission, from violating or aiding and abetting the 
                violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or of the rules and regulations thereunder; 
                or 
                 
                (B) Found by any court of competent jurisdiction in an action brought by the Commission to 
                which he or she is a party or found by the Commission in any administrative proceeding to which 
                he or she is a party to have violated (unless the violation was found not to have been willful) or 
                aided and abetted the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or of the rules and 
                regulations thereunder.

        Id. at *1. The OIP also alleges that Dean “passed the certified public accountant (‘CPA’) examination in 
1995 and holds a CPA certificate in the state of Nebraska” but “has never obtained a CPA license.” Id. at *1.

On March 15, 2010, the Commission filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the 

District of Nebraska alleging that Dean engaged in securities fraud and other violations of the 

securities laws by preparing and reviewing infoUSA’s Forms 10-K and proxy statements that 

materially understated and failed to properly disclose perquisite compensation to Vinod Gupta, 

infoUSA’s former chief executive officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors, and failed to 
                                                                        4
properly disclose related party transactions involving Gupta.             The complaint also alleged that 

D ean  aide d and abetted the filing of    info USA   ’s false Forms 10-K. 

        A jury found that Dean violated the antifraud, false proxy statements, false certifications, 

false statements and omissions to accountants and auditors, and books-and-records provisions of 

the federal securities laws. A jury also found that Dean aided and abetted infoUSA’s violations 
                                                                                                        5
of the reporting and record-keeping provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.                    On  May 

29, 2012  , the  district court entered a judgment permanently enjoining           Dean   from   future 

violations , direct  ly  or indirectly ,  of §§  10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A),  13(b)(2)(B), 13(b)(5), and 14(a)        

of the Exchange Act, and       Rules 10b   -5, 12b  -20, 13a  -1, 13a  -14, 13b2 -1, 13b2  -2, 14a  -3, and 14a  -9  
                             6
promulgated    thereunder.     The judgment also barred D       ean  from serving as a director or officer of 

a publicly  traded company for a p      eriod of three years, and ordered D       ean  to pay a c ivil monetary 
                       7
penalty of $  50,000  .  

        In issuing the OIP, we found it       “appropriate and in the public interest” that Dean be 

temporarily suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission based on the District 

Court’s final judgment. We stated that the temporary suspension would become permanent 

unless Dean filed a petition challenging it within thirty days of service of the order, pursuant to 

Rule of Practice 102(e)(3)(ii). We further advised that, pursuant to Rule of Practice 

102(e)(3)(iii), upon receipt of such a petition, we would either lift the temporary suspension, set 

the matter down for hearing, or both. 

        In his petition, Dean requests that the temporary suspension be lifted, arguing that (i) he 

has appealed the injunction entered against him, and it would be improper and in derogation of 

his rights “to allow a temporary suspension to become permanent based upon an injunction that 

may not be upheld on appeal,” (ii) the OIP was filed more than ninety days after final judgment 

and was therefore untimely under Rule 102(e)(3), (iii) the doctrine of collateral estoppel prevents

        The jury found that Dean violated (i) the antifraud provisions in Exchange Act §  10(b), 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b), 
and Rule 10b -5 thereunder, 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b  -5; (ii)  the  false proxy statements provisions of Exchange Act 
§  14(a),   15 U.S.C. § 78n(a), and Rules 14a-3 and 14a-9  thereunder, 17 C.F.R. §§ 240.14a  -3 and 14a-9; (iii)   the false 
certifications provisions of Exchange Act R ule 13a  -14,  17 C.F.R. § 240.13a  -14; (iv)   the false statements and 
omissions to accountants and auditors provisions of Exchange Act  Rule 13b2  -2, 17 C.F.R. § 240.13b2 -2; and (v) the 
books  -and -records provisions of Exchange Act § 13(b)(5), 15 U.S.C. § 78m(b)(  5), and   Rule 13b2-1  thereunder, 17 
C.F.R. §   240.13b2-1. The jury further found that Dean aided and abetted infoUSA ’s violations of (i) the issuer 
reporting requirements in Exchange Act § 13(a), 15 U.S.C. § 78m(a), and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 
thereunder, 17 C.F.R. §§ 240.12b-20 and 240.13a-1; and (ii) the books-and-records provisions of Exchange Act 
§ 13(b)(2), 15 U.S.C. § 78m(b)(2).

the Commission from imposing a permanent suspension based on findings made by the district 
court, and (iv) the suspension is not in the public interest. The Division of Enforcement has not 
filed an opposition to Dean’s petition. 

         Rule 102(e)(3)(i)(a) permits the Commission to suspend any accountant or other 
professional or expert who has been “[p]ermanently enjoined . . . from violating or aiding and 
abetting the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or of the rules and 
                             8
regulations thereunder.”  Generally, a respondent in a “follow-on” proceeding is precluded from 
                                                                                        9
challenging the basis for, or findings in, the underlying injunction action.              Although Dean is 
entitled to appeal the underlying case against him, the possibility of an appeal to the court of 
appeals  “does not alter the effect” of the jury’s finding of securities law violations or the court’s 
                                       10
imposition of an injunction here.         

         A t this stage it appears that the findings made in the injunctive proceeding and the 
injunction issued against D      ean  “justify the continuance of his suspension until it can be 
                                                                                                               11
determined what, if any, action may be appropriate to protect the Commission’s processes.”   As 
                                     12
provided in Rule 102(e)(3)(iii),         therefore, we will set the matter down for public hearing.            

         Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that this proceeding be set down for public hearing before 
an  administrative law judge in accordance with Rule of Practice 110. As specified in Rule of 
Practice 102(e)(3)(iii), the hearing in this matter shall be expedited in accordance with Rule of 
Practice 500; it is further    

         ORDERED that the administrative law jud             ge shall issue an initial decision no later than 
210 days from the date of service of this order; and it is further           

         ORDERED that the temporary suspension of               Stormy L. Dean      , entered on October 24, 
2012, remain in effect pending a hearing and decision in thi            s matter.
