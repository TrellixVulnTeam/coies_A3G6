                                                  I. 
 
       The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in 
the public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against 
Debra L. Hobbs (“Respondent” or “Hobbs”) pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(i) of the Commission’s 
                  1
Rules of Practice.  
        
                                                  II. 
 
       In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the “Offer”), which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the 
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the 

                                                           
1
   Rule 102(e)(3)(i) provides, in relevant part, that: 
 
       The Commission, with due regard to the public interest and without preliminary hearing, may, by order, . . . 
suspend from appearing or practicing before it any . . . accountant . . . who has been by name . . . permanently 
enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction, by reason of his or her misconduct in an action brought by the 
Commission, from violating or aiding and abetting the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or of 
the rules and regulations thereunder.

findings herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over her and the subject matter of 
these proceedings, and the findings contained in Section III. C. below, which are admitted, 
Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant 
to Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial 
Sanctions (“Order”), as set forth below. 
        
                                              III. 
                                                 
       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that: 
 
       A.     Hobbs, age 56, was a certified public accountant licensed to practice in the State 
of Virginia, but that license expired in 1988.  Hobbs served as Chief Financial Officer of Volt 
Delta Resources, LLC (“VDR”), a subsidiary of Volt Information Sciences, Inc. (“Volt” or “the 
Company”), from 1996 until April 2008.  In April 2008, Hobbs became the Chief Operating 
Officer of VDR.  Volt terminated Hobbs in February 2012.   
        
       B.     Volt is a New York corporation with its principal executive offices located in 
New York, New York.  Its common stock, previously registered under Section 12(b) of the 
Exchange Act, traded on the New York Stock Exchange (symbol VOL) until it was de-listed on 
May 9, 2011, for the Company’s failure to file periodic reports with the Commission.  Volt now 
trades in the Over-the-Counter market (OTC symbol VISI).  Volt provides services relating to 
staffing, telecommunications, computer systems, and printing through four corresponding 
business units. 
        
       C.     On January 18, 2013, a final judgment was entered against Hobbs, permanently 
enjoining her from violations of  Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(“Exchange Act”), and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5(a), 10b-5(b), 10b-5(c); and from aiding and 
abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and 
Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-11 thereunder, in the civil action entitled Securities 
and Exchange Commission v. Volt Information Sciences, Inc. and Debra L. Hobbs, Civil Action 
No. 13-CV-237 (S.D.N.Y.) (January 10, 2013).  The Court did not impose payment of a civil 
penalty based on Hobbs’ agreement to cooperate in a related enforcement proceeding. 
        
       D.     The Commission’s Complaint alleges that for Volt’s fiscal year ended October 28, 
2007, Volt’s computer-segment subsidiary recognized $7.55 million of revenue that it included 
in its financial statements filed with the Commission.  The Complaint further alleges that the 
recognition of the revenue was improper and caused Volt’s net income for its fourth quarter and 
fiscal year ended October 28, 2007, to be overstated materially and falsely.  The Complaint 
further alleges that Hobbs justified the improper revenue recognition by asserting the existence 
of, and the subsidiary’s substantial performance on, a purported $10 million contract of sale with 
a customer, even though the purported contract did not lead to any revenue event recognizable 
under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

                                               IV. 
                                                 
       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest 
to impose the sanction agreed to in Respondent Hobbs’ Offer. 
                                                 
       Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, effective immediately, that: 
        
       A.      Hobbs is suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an 
accountant.   
 
       B.      After 5 years from the date of this order, Respondent may request that the 
Commission consider her reinstatement by submitting an application (attention: Office of the 
Chief Accountant) to resume appearing or practicing before the Commission as: 
      
               1.     A preparer or reviewer, or a person responsible for the preparation or 
                      review, of any public company’s financial statements that are filed with 
                      the Commission.  Such an application must satisfy the Commission that 
                      Respondent’s work in her practice before the Commission will be 
                      reviewed either by the independent audit committee of the public company 
                      for which she works or in some other acceptable manner, as long as she 
                      practices before the Commission in this capacity; and/or 
 
               2.     An independent accountant.  Such an application must satisfy the 
                      Commission that: 
      
                      (a)     Respondent, or the public accounting firm with which she is 
                              associated, is registered with the Public Company Accounting 
                              Oversight Board (“Board”) in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley 
                              Act of 2002, and such registration continues to be effective; 
 
                      (b)     Respondent, or the registered public accounting firm with which 
                              she is associated, has been inspected by the Board and that 
                              inspection did not identify any criticisms of or potential defects in 
                              the respondent’s or the firm’s quality control system that would 
                              indicate that the respondent will not receive appropriate 
                              supervision; 

                      (c)     Respondent has resolved all disciplinary issues with the Board, and 
                              has complied with all terms and conditions of any sanctions 
                              imposed by the Board (other than reinstatement by the 
                              Commission); and 
 

                                                3 
 
---------------------Page 4---------------------

 
 
 
 
                      (d)     Respondent acknowledges her responsibility, as long as 
                              Respondent appears or practices before the Commission as an 
                              independent accountant, to comply with all requirements of the 
                              Commission and the Board, including, but not limited to, all 
                              requirements relating to registration, inspections, concurring 
                              partner reviews and quality control standards.   
 
       C.      The Commission will consider an application by Respondent to resume appearing 
or practicing before the Commission provided that her state CPA license is current and she has 
resolved all other disciplinary issues with the applicable state boards of accountancy.  However, 
if state licensure is dependent on reinstatement by the Commission, the Commission will 
consider an application on its other merits.  The Commission’s review may include consideration 
of, in addition to the matters referenced above, any other matters relating to Respondent’s 
character, integrity, professional conduct, or qualifications to appear or practice before the 
Commission. 
 
       By the Commission.
