 UNITED·STATES DISTRICT  COURT 
 EASTERN DISTRICT        OF  NEW YORK                                 *   JUN   f 8 2009   *:

     SECURITIES  AND EXCHANGE  COMMISSION,                            BROOKLYN      OFFICE

                                  Plaintiff, 
     v.·                                                         Civil Action  No. 

     LISA M. ROBERTS, 

                                 Defendant. 

        Plaintiff  Securities and Exchange Commission  ("Plaintiff' or "Commission")  alleges for 

. its Complaint, as follows: 

                                         SUMMARY 

        1.     Lisa  M.  Roberts  ("Roberts"  or  "Defendant")  participated  in  two  separate 

 fraudulent schemes to materially misstate the financial results of Ulticom, Inc. ("Ulticom" or the 

 "Company"),  while  serving  in  various  senior  accounting  and  management  positions  at  the 

 Company,  including  Chief  Financial  Officer  ("CFO").   The  first  scheme  involved  certain 

 improper  practices  in  connection  with  the  backdating of Ulticom  stock  options.  The  second 

 scheme  involved  improper  accounting  practices,  including  (i)  the  improper  establishment, 

 maintenance,  and  release of reserves,  and  (ii)  the  improper  recognition of revenue on certain 

 inter-company shipments and service contracts. 

        2.     From April  2000 through  at least June  2002,  at the direction of former  Ulticom 

 executives, Roberts  participated  in the  backdating of company-wide  grants of employee  stock 

 options  to coincide  with  near-term  lows  in the  Company's  stock  price.  In four  instances,  the 

 options  were  "in-the-money,"  meaning  the  exercise  prices of the  backdated  Ulticom  options 
---------------------Page 2---------------------

were  less  than  the  Company's  stock  price  on the  date  the  grants  were  formally  approved  by 

Ulticom's  Stock Option Committee  (the "Committee").  Roberts's  participation  in this scheme 

caused  Ulticom  to  award  employees  disguised  in-the-money  options  without  recording  a 

corresponding non-cash compensation  expense for the    in-th~-money  portion  of the option grant 

in  conformity  with  U.S.  Generally  Accepted  Accounting  Principles  ("GAAP").  As  a  result, 

Ulticom (i) filed materially false and misleading financial statements that materially understated 

its  compensation  expenses  and  materially  overstated  its  net  income. and  earnings  per  share 

through  the  fiscal year  ended  January  31,  2005,  and  (ii) made  disclosures  in  certain  periodic 

filings and proxy statements during this time that falsely portrayed Ulticom's  options as having 

been granted at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of Ulticom's  common stock on the 

date of the grant. 

       3.      In  the  second  fraudulent  scheme,  largely  at  the  direction of former  Ulticom 

executives, Roberts engaged in certain long-standing and improper accounting practices that she 

knew or recklessly did not know were not in conformity with GAAP.  Beginning in 1996, when 

Ulticom was a wholly-owned  subsidiary    of Comverse  Technology,  Inc. ("Comverse"),  Roberts 

made improper adjustments to Ulticom's  reserve accounts in order to stockpile reserves.  Roberts 

continued  to  make  these  and  related  improper  adjustments  after  Ulticom  became  a publicly­

tradedconipany,   while  still  majority-owned  by  Comverse,  in  2000.  In the  first  fiscal  year 

following  its initial public  offering  ("IPO"),  Ulticom  released  some of these  improper  excess 

reserves  into  income.  Without  these  releases,  the  Company  would  not  have  met  Wall  Street 

analysts'  earnings estimates.  In addition, from 1998 to April 2001, Roberts improperly deferred 

to subsequent periods the recognition  of revenues from certain  shipments  and service contracts 

between Ulticom and another subsidiary   of Comverse.  As a result, Ulticom filed materially false 

                                                2
 
---------------------Page 3---------------------

and misleading financial statements that misstated its revenues, expenses, liabilities, net income, 

and earnings per share through the fiscal year ended January 31, 2004.  In furtherance      of this· 

scheme, Roberts also misled the Company's  outside auditors. 

       4.      Roberts's  participation in these improper accounting practices caused Ulticom to 

include in its IPa registrat\on  statements fi~ancial statements and related disclosures that were 
                                       _    . _4" . 

materially  false  and  misleading  as  a  result of the  Company's  improper  accounting  practices. 

Roberts's  participation in these improper accounting practices also caused Ulticom to include in 

its registration  statements  for its follow-on  offering in  October  2000 financial  statements  and 

disclosures that were materially false  and misleading  as a result of both  the improper options 

backdating and other improper accounting practices described herein. 

       5.      Ulticom  has  announced  that  its  historical  fmancial  statements  and  any  related 

reports of its  independent registered  public  accounting  firm  should  no  longer be relied upon. 

Ulticom has announced that it will restate its historical financial  statements  for its fiscal years 

ended December 31, 1996 ("Fiscal Year 1996") through January 31, 2005 ("Fiscal Year 2004"), 

in order to record additional material non-cash charges for option-related compensation expenses 

and to correct the material misstatement of its revenues and earnings. 

       6.      By committing the acts alleged in this Complaint, Roberts violated Section 17(a) 

of the  Securities  Act of 1933  ("Securities  Act") [15  U.S.C.  §  77q(a)],  Sections  lO(b)  and 

13(b)(5) of the  Securities Exchange  Act  of 1934 ("Exchange  Act")    [15 U.S.C.  §§  78j(b) and 

78m(b)(5)]  and  Exchange  Act  Rules  lOb-5,  13b2-1,  and  13b2-2  [17  C.F.R.    §§ 240.IOb-5, 

240.13b2-1,  and 240.13b2-2].    In addition,  by committing  the  acts alleged  in this  Complaint, 

Roberts aided  and abetted  Ulticom's  violations of Exchange  Act  Sections   13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 

13(b)(2)(B),  and  14(a) [15 U.S.c.  §§  78m(a),  78m(b)(2)(A),  78m(b)(2)(B),  and  78n(a)]  and 

                                                3
 
---------------------Page 4---------------------

Exchange  Act  Rules  13a-l,  13a-ll,  13a-13,  and  14a-9  [17  C.F.R. §§ 240.13a-l,  240.13a-ll, 

240.13a-13,  and 240.14a-9].  An  injunction  is necessary to ensure that Roberts will not continue 

to violate the foregoing provisions ofthe federal securities laws. 

       7.      The  Commission  seeks  a judgment  from  the  Court:  (i)  enjoining  Roberts  from 

engaging in future violations of those sections of the federal securities laws that she violated; (ii) 

requiring her to pay a civil monetary penalty  pursuant  to Section 20(d) of the Securities Act and 

Section 21(d)(3)  of the Exchange  Act [15 U.S.C.   §§ 77t(d) and 78u(d)(3)];  and (iii) barring her 

from acting as an officer or director of a public company  pursuant to 20(e)  of the Securities Act 

and Section 21 (d)(2) ofthe Exchange Act [15 U.S.C.    §§ 77t(e) and 78u(d)(2)]. 

                                JURISDICTION        AND VENUE 

       8.      The  Court  has  jurisdiction  over  this  action  pursuant  to  Section  22(a) of the 

Securities Act  [15 U.S.C. §  77v(a)] and  Sections  21(d),  21(e) and 27 of the Exchange  Act  [15 

U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u(e) and 78aa]. 

       9.      Roberts,  directly  or indirectly,  used the means  and instrumentalities of interstate 

commerce,  or  of the mails,  or the facilities of a national  securities exchange in connection  with 

the'acts, transactions, practices and courses of business alleged herein. 

       10.     Venue is proper in this District because certain  of the acts, transactions,  practices 

and  courses of  business  alleged  herein  took  place  in  the  Eastern  District of New  York  and 

Ulticom's  parent  company,  Comverse,  was  headquartered  and/or  maintained  an  office  in 

Woodbury,   New  York at all relevant times. 

                                      THE   DEFENDANT 

       11.     Defendant   Lisa  M.  Roberts,   43,  a  resident of Cape  May,  New  Jersey,   IS a 

certified public accountant  ("CPA")  in New Jersey.  Roberts joined  Ulticom  in December  1994 

                                                 4
 
---------------------Page 5---------------------

and served in various aGcounting positions  until becoming Vice President and CFO on July 2, 

1998.  Once she was replaced by a new CFO in  1999, Roberts served as the    Company~s   Vice 

President of Finance  until  September  2001,  when  she  became  Vice  President of Corporate 

Administration.  Her  title  changed  to  Vice  President of Operations  in November  2002.  She 

became Ulticom's  Senior Vice President of Operations in March 2006, a position she held  Until 

her termination on October 31, 2007.  From March 13, 2000 to April 27, 2001, Roberts signed 

management  representation  letters  to the  Company's  outside auditors.  From  at least  January 

2000 to May 2002, Roberts prepared and/or reviewed Ulticom's  periodic reports on Forms 10-Q 

and 10-K, proxies, and registration statements. 

                                   RELATED      PARTIES 

       12.    Comverse  Technology,  Inc.,  a New York corporation which at all relevant times 

was based in Woodbury, New York, makes software systems and provides related services for 

multimedia  communication  and  information  processing  applications.  Comverse is the  parent 

company and majority shareholder   of Ulticom and, at various times relevant to this Complaint, 

former  Comverse  executives  and board members  also  served as former  executives' and  board 

members ofUlticom.  Specifically, Comverse's  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") 

was  Chairman   of Ulticom's  board   of directors  from  October  1997  until  May  1, 2006. 

Comverse's  CFO was Ulticom's  CFO from December 1999 to September 2001, and an Ulticom 

Director  from  April  2000  to  May 1, 2006  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  "Former  CFO"). 

Comverse's  General  Counsel was the  Corporate  Secretary and a Director of Ulticom  from  at 

least 2000 until June 2004.  He also served on several board committees,  including Ulticom's 

Compensation Committee, and provided legal services   to Ulticom through a services agreement 

between Comverse and Ulticom.

       13.     Ulticom,  Inc. is a New Jersey corporation based  in Mount Laurel, New  Jersey, 

that   provides.  service-enabling   signaling   software   for     fixed,  mobile,   and   internet 

communications.  Ulticom was a wholly-owned  subsidiary     of Comverse  until its IPa  in April . 

2000;  it  has  been  a  majority-owned  subsidiary of Comverse  since  April 20qO.·  Ulticom's 

common stock was registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b)       of the Exchange 

Act and traded on the NASDAQ  Global Market.  Trading in Ulticom stock was suspended on 

February .1, 2007, and the stock was eventually delisted, due to Ulticom's  failure to file timely its 

fiscal  2005  annual  report  on  Form  10-K and  fiscal  2006  quarterly  reports on Forms  10-Q. 

Ulticom  has  not  filed  any  periodic  reports  with  the  Commission  since  December  2005. 

Currently Ulticom's  stock is registered  with the Commission  pursuant to  Section  12(g) of the 

Exchange Act and is quoted on the "Pink Sheets" under the symbol "ULCM" or "ULCM.PK." 

                                            FACTS 

       A.     .Ulticom's Backdating   of Stock Options 

       14.    Ulticom  used  employee  stock  options  as  a  form of  compensation  to  recruit, 

incentivize and retain key employees, as did many other companies at the time.  Between April 

2000  and  April  2004,  however,  in  part  through  Roberts's  participation,  four of Ulticom's 

backdated  stock  option  grants  resulted  .in  the  award of disguised  in-the-money  options  to 

employees  of the  Company.  Ulticom  did not disclose the in-the-money  status  nor record  the 

corresponding  non-cash  compensation  expenses  for the  in-the-money  portion of these  option 

grants in conformity with GAAP. 

       15.    As a result, Ulticom filed materially false and misleading financial statements that 

materially understated its compensation  expenses and materially overstated  its net income and 

earnings  per share through the fiscal  year ended January 31, 2005.  The  Company also made 

                                               6
 
---------------------Page 7---------------------

disclosures in certain periodic filings and proxy statements during this time that falsely portrayed 

Ulticom's  options  as having  been granted  at exercise prices  equal to the  fair market  value of 

Ulticom's  common stock on the date   of the grant. 

               1.      The Ulticom  Stock  Option   Plan 

        16,    Since going public in 2000, and continuing to June 2005, Ulticom granted options 

to  its  employees  and  employee-directors  pursuant  to'"the  Company's  1998  Stock  Incentive 

Compensation  Plan  ("Plan"),  which  was  amended  effective  January  20,  2000.  The Plan  was 

diafted  by Comverse's  General Counsel and was approved by Ulticom's  board      of directors and 

voted upon by its shareholders. 

        17.    The  stated  purpose of Ulticorn's  Plan  was  to attract  and  retain  employees  and 

directors at Ulticom and its subsidiaries by giving those persons  "a greater stake in [Ulticom's] 

success  and a closer  identity  with  it."  The Plan gave Ulticom's  Stock  Option  Committee the 

power  to interpret and administer the Plan and the authority:  (i) to select the specific employees 

to  whom awards  would  be granted;  (ii) to detennine  the type and amount    of the  award to be 

granted such employees; and (iii) to detennine  the tenns  of the option agreements to be entered 

into  with  such  employees.  In practice,  the  Committee  approved  an  option  grant  based  on  a 

master list of grantees compiled  by Ulticom' s management.  The Plan expressly prohibited the 

award of incentive stock options at less than the fair market value of a share of common stock  on 

the date of grant.  "Fair market value" was defined as the mean between the highest and lowest. 

sale price of Ulticom  common  stock on the principal  national  securities  exchange  on which it 

was listed on the date ofthe grant. 

                                                7
 
---------------------Page 8---------------------

               2.     The  Ulticom  Bylaws 

        18.    Ulticom's  bylaws, effective from March 2000 to the present, make clear that the 

Committee can formally act upon stock option grant proposals in two ways.  The Committee can 

act without a formal meeting,  if all members consent in writing to the adoption  of a resolution 

authorizing  the  action  (i.e.,  the  consent  must  be  unanimous),  or  the  Committee  can  act  by 

holding a meeting  at which a quorum   of Committee members is present,    if a majority of those 

present at the meeting approve the action. 

               3.     The  Ulticom  Option  Grant  Process 

        19.    Beginning in 2000,  and continuing  until April  2004, Ulticom  made eight  stock 

option  grants  in  which  the  grant  dates  preceded  the  date  on  which  Ulticom's  Stock  Option 

Committee  had  formally  acted  to  approve  the  grant  proposals.   The  exercise  price of the 

underlying  options  did  not  reflect  the  "fair  market value"  on  the  date  when  the  Committee 

formally acted to approve such grants, and, by the time the Committee did formally act, options 

underlying four of the grants were in-the-money.  Throughout the relevant period, Roberts had 

an administrative role in the  option granting process and, until late 2001, was responsible  for 

recording any compensation expenses related to the option grants.  As a CPA, Roberts knew, or 

was reckless in not knowing, that the in-the-money portion  of these grants should have been, but 

was not, recorded as a compensation  expense  on Ulticom's  books and records  or reflected  in 

Ulticom's financial statements. 

       20.     Ulticom's   options-grant   process   commenced   with   Ulticom   executives 

approaching the Former CFO or Comverse's  CEO to obtain authorization to initiate a grant.  As 

part of that  initial  contact  regarding  initiation of a  grant  or  shortly  thereafter,  Ulticom's 

executives  and  employees  would  forward  to  the  Former  CFO  or  Comverse's  CEO  a  list of 

                                                8
 
---------------------Page 9---------------------

proposed grantees along with the proposed number     of shares to be granted to each.  If a grant 

was detennined  to be appropriate, the Fonner  CFO then instructed certain Ulticom executives, 

including Roberts, and employees to review the Company's  historical stock prices and select a 

date on  which  the  stock  was  trading  at  a  low  price.  Roberts and  other  individuals  typically 

looked back a week or two and presented the Fonner  CFO with the lowest closing price during 

the  look-back  period.   The  Fonner  CFO  approved  a  grant  date  based  on  the  infonnation 

provided. 

       21.     A  master  list of proposed  option  grantees,  which  identified  for  each  person  a 

proposed number   of options to be granted, typically then was forwarded to Comverse for review 

and, sometimes, revision. 

       22.     While the master list of grantees was being reviewed, Roberts and other Ulticom 

executives and employees prepared a Unanimous Written Consent, based on a template provided 

by Comverse's  General  Counsel, to be forwarded  to and signed  by all members    of Ulticom's 

Stock Option Committee in order to approve the grant.  Roberts and other Ulticom executives 

and employees inserted into each Unanimous Written Consent an "as     of' date that was the date 

that had been selected using the look-back procedure at the outset of the grant process, instead of 

the date when the COInmittee had approved  the grant.  Following  approval    of the Unanimous 

Written Consents by Comverse's  General Counsel and approval    of the master list of grantees by 

Comverse, the Unanimous Written Consents were forwarded to the Committee for signature. 

       23.    The  Fonner  CFO,  General  Counsel,  and  certain  fonner  Ulticom  executives, 

including  Roberts,  and  employees. knew  that  the  "as of' date  reflected  in  each  Unanimous 

Written Consent - which, in turn, detennined  the exercise price for the underlying options - not 

only preceded the date on which the Committee had acted on the option grant proposal, it also 

                                               9
 
---------------------Page 10---------------------

preceded the date on which anyone had even begun to prepare the Unanimous Written Consents. 

As  a  result,  Roberts  knew,  or  was  reckless  in  not  knowing,  that  Ulticom's  options  were 

backdated and granted at less than fair market value on the date of the grant. 

       24.    Ultimately, for the eight option grants made by Ulticom betWeen April 2000 and 

April 2004, a Unanimous Written Consent and master list  of proposed grantees was forwarded to 

each  member   of Ulticom' s  Stock  Option  Committee  for  review  and  signature.  Committee 

members signed their individual copies of the Unanimous Written Consents and returned them to 

Ulticom where they subsequently were forwarded to Comverse's  General Counsel for filing as 

corporate records.  The Committee acted upon option grant proposals during this period solely 

through Unanimous Written Consents. 

       25.    None   of the  Unanimous  Written  Consents that  were  signed in connection with 

stock option grants between April 2000 and April 2004 identified the specific dates on which any 

Committee members  had signed them.  None      of the Unanimous  Written  Consents during that 

period identified the date on which any stock option· grant had been approved by the Committee. 

The sole date reflected on the Unanimous Written Consents was the "as    of' date that had been 

approved by the Former CFO and that preceded any Committee action. 

       26.    Ulticom  changed  its  options-grant  practices  in or  around  Apri( 2004,  at which· 

point  Ulticom  adopted  the  practice of recording  a  grant  date  only  after  receipt of signed 

Unanimous Written Consents from all Committee members. 

              4.	     Ulticom's  Materially  Misleading  Financials  And 
                      Disclosures  Resulting From  Its Options  Practices 

       27.    Options underlying four  of the eight grants made by Ulticom between April 2000 

and April 2004 were in-the-money on the date when Ulticom's  Stock Option Committee acted 

upon the grant proposals. 

                                              10 
---------------------Page 11---------------------

       28.     The four grants were in-the-money,  by the following amounts per option, when 

the Committee acted upon the grant proposals: 

       "As  Of'     Exercise     Date  Of      Fair Market   Value    In-The-Money

                                                                      Approval  Date

Because it stated in its public filings that it accounted for its options during the relevant period in 

conformity with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for  Stock Issued to 

Employees," ("APB 25"), Ulticom was required to record a compensation expense in connection 

with these four grants over the four-year vesting period of the options. It did not do so. 

       29.     As a CPA and one   of the Company's  senior accounting executives  who directly 

participated in the options granting process, Roberts knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that 

the  in-the-money  portion  of these  grants  should  have  been,  but  was  not,  recorded  as  a 

compensation  expense  on  Ulticom's  books  and  records  or  reflected  in  Ulticom's  financial 

statements in conformity with APB 25. 

       30.    As a result of the conduct of Roberts and others, Ulticom materially overstated its 

net income and earnings per share for fiscal yearsellded  January 31, 2001 ("Fiscal Year 2000") 

through January 31,2005  ("Fiscal Year 2004").  Ulticom's  overstatement, as a percentage  of its 

previously-reported pre-tax income, ranged from as little as 2.7% to as much as 16.3% between 

Fiscal Years 2000 and 2004. 

       31.    Ulticom issued quarterly earnings press releases, which contained materially false 

and  misleading  financial  results,  in  current  reports  filed  with  the  Commission  on  Form  8-K 

                                              11
 
---------------------Page 12---------------------

between June 2003 and December 2005.  Ulticom knew or was reckless in not knowing that the 

net  income  and  earnings  figures  reported  in  such  documents  were  materially  false  and 

misleading as a result of its improper options-grant practices. 

       32.     Ulticom  published   (or  incorporated  by  reference)  its  materially  false  and 

misleading financial results for Second Quarter 2000 in, among other documents filed with the 

Commission and prepared and/or reviewed by Roberts, its registration  statement on Form       S-1 

and the offering prospectus for its follow-on offering, pursuant to which it (and certain of its and 

Comverse's  executives)  sold  4,250,000  shares of common  stock at  $50 per  share  in  October 

2000.  Through her involvement in the preparation  of these filings, her knowledge as a CPA, and 

her position as a senior accounting executive who directly participated  in the options granting 

process, Roberts knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that the net income and earnings figures 

reported  in  such documents  were materially  false  and  misleading  as a result of the· improper 

options-grant practices. 

       33.     The Form  S-1  and related prospectus for Ulticom's  follow-on offering in October 

2000 also contained materially  false and misleading  disclosures about Ulticom's  stock option­

granting practices and accounting, which Roberts knew, or was reckless in not knowing, were 

materially false and misleading due to her role in the options backdating scheme.  There, less 

than  two ,months after  the  grant  dated  "as of' July 10, 2000,  Ulticom  made  the  following 

materially  misleading  statements  in  three  separate  sections of its  registration  statement  and 

prospectus: 

       The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, 'Accounting 
       For Stock Issued to Employees,'  and related interpretations in accounting for its 
       option plans.  Accordingly,  as all options  have  been  granted  at exercise prices 
       equal to fair market value on the date of grant, no compensation expense has been 
       recognized  by  the  Company  in  connection  with  its  stock-based  compensation 
       plans. 

                                               12

                                           *  *  *   *  * 
        Options which are designated as "incentive stock options" under    the option plans 
       may be granted with an exercise price not less than the fair market value     of the 
       underlying shares at the date  of grant and are subject to certain quantity and other 
        limitations specified in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code. 
                                           *  *  *  *   * 
       The price per share at which common stock may be purchased upon exercise       of an 
       option is determined by the committee; however, in the case    of grants of incentive 
        stock options, the price per share may not be less than the fair market value  of a 
        share of common stock on the date   of grant. 
                                                     .... 
        34.    Ulticom made additional materially misleading disclosures about its options-grant 

process in proxy statements prepared and/or reviewed by Roberts on Form DEF 14A, filed with 

the Commission  on May 10, 2002 and May 16,2003.  Specifically, with respect to options that 

Ulticom  had  granted  to  certain of  its  executives  in  the  "last  fiscal  year,"  Ulticom  falsely 

represented_that  "[t]he  exercise  price of the  options  is  equal  to  the  fair  market  value of the 

underlying shares at the date of grant."  The grants referred to - the March 5, 2001 and June 25, 

2002  grants - in fact were  in-the-money  on the date   of Committee  approval  and the  exercise 

prices of the underlying options did not reflect fair market value.  Through  her involvement  in 

the  options  backdating  fraud,  Roberts  knew,  or  was  reckless  in  not  knowing,  that  these 

disclosures in the proxies and registration statements were materially false and misleading. 

       35.     Based  on  her  involvement  in  the  option  grant  process,  Roberts  knew,  or  was 

reckless  in not knowing, that  the Unanimous  Written Consents  were false because the "as     of' 

dates inserted into the Unanimous  Written Consents, and later reflected in Ulticom's  books and 

records, did not represent the date on which the Committee approved the option grants.  Roberts 

knew that no corporate action to approve the option grants had actually occurred on    the  "as of' 

dates. 

       36.     By  virtue  of  the  involvement   of Roberts  and  others  in  the  stock  options 

backdating, Ulticom's  books and records falsely and "inaccurately reflected, among other things, 

                                                13
 
---------------------Page 14---------------------

the compensation and income tax expense   ass_ociated with the Company's  grants of stock options 

to  its employees, the Company's  net income  and earnings per share, and   its general financial 

condition.  In addition, Roberts circumvented internal accounting controls by her involvement in 

this  fraud,  and,  as  a  result,  Ulticom  also  failed  to  maintain  a  system of internal  accounting 

controls sufficient to provide assurances that its stock option grants were recorded as necessary 

to permit the proper preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP. 

       B.Ulticom's       Reserve   and Revenue  Recognition  Practices 

       37.     Pre-dating Ulticom's  stock options backdating practices, and continuing through 

atleast January 31, 2002 ("Fiscal Year 2001"), Ulticom engaged in other improper accounting 

practices,  including  (i)  the  improper  creation,  maintenance  and  use of reserves  from  1996 

through Ulticom's  fiscal quarter ending October 31, 2001 ("Third  Quarter   2001 "); and (ii) the 

improper deferral of revenues on certain transactions between Ulticom and another subsidiary   of 

Comverse,  Comverse Network  System's  Israeli  Division  ("CNS-Israel"  or  "Comverse  Ltd."), 

between 1998 and April 2001. 

       38.     At  the  direction of the  Former  CFO  and  others,  Roberts  implemented  and/or 

directed  these  improper  accounting  practices.  As  a  CPA  and  one of the  Company's  senior 

accounting  executives,  however,  Roberts  knew,  or  was  reckless  in  not  knowing,  that  such 

practices were not in conformity with GAAP. 

       39.     Through the misconduct   of Roberts and others, Ulticom filed materially false and 

misleading  financial  statements,  including  those  that  were  incorporated  into  registration 

statements  for  the  Company's  IPO  and  follow-on  offerings,  that  misstated  the  Company's
               / 

revenues,  expenses,  liabilities,  net  income,  and earnings  per  share through  Fiscal  Year  2003. 

                                               14
 
---------------------Page 15---------------------

 Although  these  improper  practices  ceased  by  late  2001,  they  continued  to  cause  Ulticom's 

 reported financials to be misstated in subsequent  fiscal years, up through Fiscal Year 2004. 

                 1.     Ulticom's  Improper    Reserves Practices 

         40.     Beginning  in  1996  and  continuing  through  Third  Quarter  2001,  Ulticom 

 improperly  increased  the reserves  that Were on Ulticom's  books and records  and/or maintained 

 reserves  that  were  no  longer  needed    in  periods  when  the  Company  performed  above 

 expectations. 

         41.'    Specifically, under the direction of certain former executives,  Ulticom, including 

 Roberts,  maintained  and routinely  updated  spreadsheets  that tracked  its revenues  and earnings. 

 The spreadsheet  that tracked Ulticom's  revenues  was entitled "Rev  Proj."  The spreadsheet  that 

 tracked  Ulticom's  earnings  was  known  among  Ulticom  executives  as  the  "cancer  table." 

 Together these spreadsheets enabled Ulticom  quickly to identify gaps between actual results and 

 projected  results and Wall Street analyst  estimates  as each quarter  and year progressed,  and to 

 make adjustments  (including adjustments  to reserve balances) as necessary to  lessen or close the 

 gap. 

         42.    Roberts  and/or  other  Ulticom  executives  also  tracked  the  Company's  reserve 

 balances  (and reserve usage) on a spreadsheet  entitled  "Accruals-Buffers."   The spreadsheet ­

 updated on a monthly (and later quarterly)  basis -listed  for each reserve the reserve balance (in 

. one column) and the amount   of the balance that was excess and thus available for release (in an 

 adjacent column).  The excess amounts were denoted either as "buffer"  or "amount excess." 

        43.     During Ulticom'squarter-end   and year-end  closing  processes,  Ulticom's  Former 

 CFO directed Roberts, and/or Roberts,  in turn, directed  others on the accounting  staff, to make 

 improper adjustments to Ulticom's  reserve levels, as necessary, either to stockpile reserves in the 

                                                 15
 
---------------------Page 16---------------------

event an earnings boost was needed in the future or to close the gap between Ulticom' s actual 

and projected earnings. 

       44.     Such adjustments, for the most part, were Unrelated to the underlying liability for 

which any reserve had initially been created and were not in conformity with GAAP, including 

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards   No.5,  Accounting for Contingencies ("SFAS 5"), 

at ~ 8, or Accounting  Principles Board Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes ("APB 20"), at     ~~ 

13 and 36-38. 

       45.     As a CPA and one   of the Company's  senior accounting executives, Roberts knew, 

or was reckless in not knowing, that these adjustments were not in conformity with GAAP. 

       46.     In September 200I, a new CFO arrived at Ulticom, and the Company undertook 

to reverse a number  of its excess  reserve balances during the quarter ended January  31, 2002 

("Fourth Quarter 2001").  However, the reversals were not done in conformity with GAAP and 

Ulticom  did  not  release  the  excess  balances  into  the  proper  historical  periods.  In  addition, 

certain excess reserves remained on Ulticom' s books and records in each period through the end 

of Fiscal Year 2004. 

              2.      Ulticom's  Improper   Deferral of Revenues 

      . 47.   Beginning in  1998 and continuing through April 2001, at the direction   of senior 

management, .Roberts  implemented  and/or  directed  the  implementation  of  improper  revenue 

recogriition practices with respect to contracts between Ulticom and Comverse subsidiary CNS­

Israel,  in  an  effort  to  smooth  revenues  and  demonstrate  steady  (as  opposed  to  volatile  and 

unsustainable) revenue growth to Ulticom investors. 

       48.    The  improper  and  unsupported  revenue  deferrals  involved  inter-company 

shipments between Ulticomand  CNS-Israel.  Ulticom's  accounting staff fabricated problems to 

                                               16
 
---------------------Page 17---------------------

prohibit the acceptance of products by CNS-Israel when in reality no such problems existed, or, 

if the products had already been shipped, Ulticom's  accounting  staff worked  with CNS-Israel 

accounting staff to coordinate a delay in the recording of invoices on their respective books and 

records.  Also,  on  occasion,  Ulticom's  accounting  staff  asked  CNS-Israel  to  delay  making 

payments for services that Ulticom had performed on behalf  of CNS-Israel for third parties. 

       49.     By engaging in such practices, Ulticom violated its own long-standing policy    of 

recognizing revenue on the date that the product was shipped to the customer, which also waS  the 

date on which Ulticom was required to invoice the customer.  In addition, these practices were 

not in conformity with  GAAP, including  Statement    of Financial Accounting  Concepts   No.5, 

Recognition and Measurement in Financial Statements    of Business Enterprises ("SFAC 5"), at   ~ 

83. 

       50.     As a CPA and one   of the Company's  senior accounting executives, Roberts knew, 

or was reckless in not knowing, that these revenue deferrals were not in conformity with either 

the Company's  revenue recognition policy or GAAP. 

       51.     As a result of these revenue recognition practices, Ulticom materially understated 

its revenues and pre-tax earnings in Fiscal Year 1998 and it overstated its revenues and pre-tax 

earnings in Fiscal Years 1999,2000  and2001: 

                                                     $  838,700) 
                                                        $ 67,100 
                                                       $ 461,600 
                                                       $ 310,000 

       52.    Ulticom  published  (or  incorporated  by  reference)  these  materially  false  and 

misleading  financial  results for Fiscal Years  1998 and  1999 in, among  other  documents  filed 

                                               17
 
---------------------Page 18---------------------

with the Commission  and prepared  and/or  reviewed  by Roberts,  its registration  statements on 

Form  8-1 and offering prospectuses for its IPO and follow-on offering. 

       53.     Further, because the impact ofUlticom's  revenue-recognition practices from these 

periods remained  on the  Company's  books  and records  in subsequent fiscal  periods,  Ulticom 

materially misstated its revenues, net income and earnings per share through Fiscal Year 2001. 

       54.     As  a  result of these  improper  revenue  recognition  practices  implemented  by 

Roberts  and  others,  Ulticom's  books  and  records  falsely  and  inaccurately  reflected  the 

Company's  revenues,  net  income,  earnings  per  share  and  the  Company's  general  financial 

condition.   Roberts  circumvented  internal  accounting  controls  by  her  involvement  in  the 

improper revenue recognition practices, and, as a result, Ulticom also failed to maintain a system 

of internal accounting  controls  sufficient  to  provide  assurances that  its  expenses  and revenue 

were recorded as necessary to permit the proper preparation of financial statements in conformity 

withGAAP. 

               3.·    Ulticom's  Public  Stock  Offerings 

                      a.     IPO 

       55.     On or about April 5,2000,  Ulticom commenced its    IPa  of 4.25 million shares of 

common  stock  at  a  price of $13  per  share.   In  connection  with  its IPa, Ulticom  filed  a 

registration statement on Form  8-1 and a prospectus,  which were prepared and/or reviewed by 

Roberts  and  which  included  audited  fmancial  statements  for  Ulticom's  fiscal  years  ending 

January 31, 1998("Fiscal  Year 1997"), January   31,1999   ("Fiscal Year 1998") andJanuary  31, 

2000 ("Fiscal  Year 1999").  The registration  statement and prospectus also included unaudited 

financials for Fiscal Year 1996.  This was the fIrst time that the public had been provided with 

                                               18
 
---------------------Page 19---------------------

 Ulticom-specific  earnings  data,  its financial  results having been  consolidated  with  those of its 

parent (Comverse) prior to that time. 

        56.     In Fiscal  Years  1996,  1997, and  1999, at the  direction of the  Former  CFO  and 

 others, Roberts  established  unnecessary  reserves and inflated existing  reserves.  In Fiscal  Year 

 1998, Ulticom improperly took some    of the excess amounts in its reserve accounts into income. 

        57.     These  improper  reserve  practices  caused  Ulticom  to  report,  in  the  registration 

statement on Form    S-1 and prospectus for its IPO, the following materially misleading earnings 

and loss amounts: 

          1996           $        1,577,000) 
          1997           $        2,055,000 
          Jan. 1998      $         (431,000) 
          1998           $        1,567,000 
          1999           $        1,574,000 

Roberts knew, or was reckless  in not knowing,  that Ulticom thereby falsely presented  itself as 

having achieved steady earnings  on a per share basis for the three years leading up to its lPG, 

when, in fact, its actual results had been more volatile. 
                                       \') 
        58.     After  the  close of Fiscal  Year  1998, at  the  direction of the  Former  CFO  and 

others, Roberts,  and/or those acting at her direction, deferred a substantial  amount  of revenues 

into  Fiscal  Year  1999 to  smooth  the  Company's  financial  results.  In  Fiscal  Years  1999 and 

2000, Ulticom overstated its revenues. 

        59.    Through her involvement  in the improper reserve and revenue practices,  Roberts 

knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that the historical earnings and loss amounts reported  in 

Ulticom's  IPO Form   S-l  registration  statement and prospectus were materially  misleading  as  a 

result of the improper reserve and revenue recognition practices. 

                                                 19 
                                                                                                              .0 
---------------------Page 20---------------------

                      b.      Follow-On Offering 

        60.    On or about October 17,2000,  Ulticom commenced its follow-on offering     of 4.25 

million  shares of common stock at a price   of $50 per share.  In connection  with  its offering, 

Ulticom filed a registration statement on Form S-l and a prospectus, which were prepared and/or 

reviewed by Roberts and which included the same rp.aterially misleading financials that Ulticom 

had included  in its IPO registration  statement - i.e., Fiscal  Year  1996 (unaudited)  and  Fiscal 

Years 1997 through 1999 (audited) - and it added unaudited financials for the six month period 

ending July 31, 2000 ("First and Second Quarter 2000"). 

       61.     For the First and Second Quarters   of 2000, as a result of its continued improper 

reserve practices, Ulticom reported materially misleading cumulative earnings   of $2,677,000 (or 

$0.07 diluted EPS). 

       62.     Through her involvement in the improper reserve and revenue practices, Roberts 

knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that the historical earnings and loss amounts reported in 

the  Form  S-l  registration  statement  for  Ulticom's  follow-on  offering  and  prospectus  were 

materially misleading as a result ofthe improper reserve and revenue recognition practices. 

       63.     Ulticom issued quarterly earnings press releases, which contained materially false 

and  misleading  financial  results,  in  current  reports  filed  with  the  Commission  on  Form  8-K 

between June 2003 and December 2005.  Through her involvement in the improper reserve and 

revenue practices, Roberts knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that Ulticom's  net income and 

earnings figures reported in such documents were materially false and misleading as a result   of 

the improper reserve and revenue recognition practices. 

       64.     By virtue of  her  involvement  in the  improper  reserve  and  revenue  recognition 

practices,  Roberts  knew, or was  reckless  in  not  knowing,  that  Ulticom's  books  and  records 

                                               20

falsely and inaccurately reflected, among  other things, the Company's  net income and earnings 

per share, and its general financial condition.  Roberts circumvented internal accounting controls 

by her involvement   in the improper reserve and revenue recognition practices, and, as a result, 

caused Ulticom to fail to maintain a system  of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide 

assurances that  its liabilities, expenses,  and revenue  were recorded  as necessary to permit  the 

proper preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP. 

       C.      Roberts's  Material  Misrepresentations  to Ulticom's  Auditors 

       65.     As  Ulticom's  Vice  President   of ·Finance,  Roberts  signed  false  management 

representation letters that were provided  to Ulticom's  outside auditor from March  13, 2000 to 

April 27, 2001.  Among other things, Roberts represented to auditors that the audited financial 

statements included in the prospectuses  for Ulticom's  IPO and follow-on offering "present[ed] 

fairly the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the Company for the periods 
                                                                                                             .. 
given." 

       66.     With the knowledge   of the Former CFO, Roberts also made other oral and written 

misrepresentations  to the  Company's  outside  auditor, primarily  about  the  reasons for revenue 

deferrals in  1999 and  2000.  Roberts  improperly  claimed  that  such  deferrals  were  related  to 

acceptance  issues,  when  in  fact  there  were  no  acceptance  issues.   For  example,  Roberts 

knowingly misrepresented to Ulticom's  outside auditor the reasons for the deferral  of $775,000 

in revenues related to a certaincontract to the first quarter offiscal 1999.
