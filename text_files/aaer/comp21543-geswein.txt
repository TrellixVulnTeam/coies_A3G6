       Plaintiff United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) alleges:  

                                           SUMMARY  

       1.       This action involves earnings management fraud by the financial management of 

Diebold, Incorporated (“Diebold”), an Ohio corporation that manufactures and sells automated 

teller machines (“ATMs”), bank security systems, and electronic voting machines.  Gregory 

Geswein, Diebold’s former Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), Kevin Krakora, Diebold’s former 

Controller and later its CFO, and Sandra Miller, Diebold’s former Director of Corporate 

Accounting, engaged in fraudulent accounting practices to inflate earnings to meet forecasts.  

From at least 2002 to 2007, these fraudulent practices included (i) improper use of “bill-and-

hold” accounting; (ii) improper recognition of revenue on a lease agreement subject to an 

undisclosed side buy-back agreement; (iii) manipulating reserves and accruals; (iv) improperly 

delaying and capitalizing expenses; and (v) improperly writing up the value of used inventory.

         Case: 5:10-cv-01235  Doc #: 1   Filed:  06/02/10  2 of 36.  PageID #: 2  

       2.      As a result of these practices, Diebold filed at least 40 annual, quarterly, and 

current reports with the Commission, issued dozens of press releases, and otherwise made public 

statements that contained material misstatements and omissions concerning the company’s 

financial performance.  Diebold’s improper, and in many instances fraudulent, accounting 

practices misstated the company’s reported pre-tax earnings by at least $127 million.  To correct 

the most recent misstatements, on September 30, 2008, Diebold restated its financial statements 

for the years 2003 through 2006, and the first quarter of 2007, in its Form 10-K for 2007. 

       3.      By engaging in the practices and transactions alleged in this Complaint, Geswein, 

Krakora, and Miller violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) [15 

U.S.C. §77q(a)], Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange 

Act”) [15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b) and 78m(b)(5)] and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 [17 

C.F.R. §§ 240.10b-5 and 240.13b2-1] and aided and abette                                 d Diebold’s violations of  Exchange 

Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and13(b)(2)(B) [15 U.S.C. §§ 78m(a), 78m(b)(2)(A), and 

78m(b)(2)(B)] and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 [17 C.F.R. §§ 

240.12b-20, 240.13a-1, 240.13a-11, and 240.13a-13].   Geswein and Krakora also violated 

Exchange Act Rules 13a-14 and 13b2-2 [17 C.F.R. §§ 240.13a-14 and 240.13b2-2], and Section 

304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 [15 U.S.C. § 7243].   

       4.      The Commission seeks entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining each 

defendant from further violations of these federal securities laws, ordering disgorgement of ill-

gotten gains with prejudgment interest, imposing civil monetary penalties, and, with respect to 

Geswein and Krakora, ordering that they reimburse Diebold for bonuses and other incentive and 

equity compensation that they received, and that the Court impose an officer-and-director bar.

       5.      This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Securities Act Sections 20 

and 22(a) [15 U.S.C. §§ 77(t) and 77v(a)] and Exchange Act Sections 21 and 27 [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u 

and 78aa].  Defendants, directly or indirectly, made use of the means or instrumentalities of 

interstate commerce or the mails, or a facility of a national securities exchange, in connection 

with the conduct alleged herein. 

       6.      Venue is proper because certain of the acts, practices, and courses of business 

constituting the violations occurred within this judicial district.

       7.      Gregory Geswein, 55, is a resident of Toledo, Ohio.  He was the CFO of Diebold 

from 2000 to 2005.  He was Diebold’s principal accounting officer from 2000 to 2002 and 

principal financial officer from 2000 to 2005. 

       8.      Kevin Krakora, 54, is a resident of Canton, Ohio.  He was Diebold’s Controller 

from 2001 through 2005, and the company’s CFO from 2005 through April 2009.  Krakora was 

Diebold’s principal accounting officer from 2003 to 2006 and principal financial officer from  

2005 to 2009.  When Krakora was Diebold’s Controller, he reported directly to Geswein.  

Krakora stepped down as Diebold’s CFO in April 2009, but remains an employee of Diebold.  

Krakora was a certified public accountant licensed in Ohio, but his license is now inactive. 

       9.      Sandra Miller, 42, is a resident of Paris, Ohio.  She was Diebold’s Director of 

Corporate Accounting from 2002 to 2006.  During her tenure at Diebold, Miller reported to

common stock is registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(b) and is 

listed on the New York Stock Exchange. 

                                           FACTS  

       11.     From 2002 to 2007, Diebold management conducted meetings known as monthly 

business reviews (“MBRs”), in which each Diebold business unit would review the past month’s 

financial performance and that quarter’s projected results.  Geswein, and later Krakora, would 

then compare the company’s projections to stock analysts’ consensus earnings projections for  

Diebold.  Typically, Diebold’s internally projected earnings were lower than the analyst  

consensus earnings projection.  Toward the end of most quarters, Krakora compiled “opportunity  

lists” of ways to close the gap between the company’s actual financial results and analyst 

forecasts.  Krakora reviewed such lists with Geswein. While some items on the “opportunity 

lists” represented legitimate business opportunities, others were fraudulent accounting 

transactions designed to improperly recognize revenue or otherwise inflate Diebold’s financial 

performance.  

       12.     As quarters came to a close, Geswein and Krakora received “flash reports,” 

sometimes on a daily basis, comparing Diebold’s actual earnings to analyst consensus earnings 

forecasts, which were often referred to as “required” or “necessary” earnings.  Geswein and 

Krakora used the often improper “opportunities” from the “opportunity lists” that they devised to 

reach this earnings target.  Miller made various manual accounting entries corresponding to these 

“opportunities” to Diebold’s books.  Miller knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that these 

“opportunities” and the corresponding manual journal entries were improper.  The Defendants 

knew or were reckless in not knowing that their actions were causing Diebold to report 

materially false financial results to the public.

       13.     As described below,  Geswein, Krakora, and Miller, acting knowingly or 

recklessly, each orchestrated and/or participated in one or more of the following fraudulent 

accounting practices, which caused Diebold to report materially false and misleading financial 

results to the public: (i) improper use of “bill-and-hold” accounting; (ii) improper recognition of 

revenue on a lease agreement subject to an undisclosed side buy-back agreement; 

(iii) manipulating reserves and accruals; (iv) improperly delaying and capitalizing expenses; 

and/or (v) improperly writing up the value of used inventory.  As a result of these fraudulent 

accounting schemes, Geswein and Krakora made numerous material false and misleading 

statements and omissions of material fact in press releases, to investment analysts on conference 

calls, and in Diebold’s Forms 8-K, 10-Q, and 10-K filed with the Commission.  

     Improper Use of “Bill-and-Hold” Accounting to Prematurely Recognize Revenue  

                 Background on Diebold’s Use of “Bill-and-Hold” Accounting 

       14.     Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), a seller of goods 

generally may not recognize revenue until, among other things, the product is delivered to the 

customer.  An exception exists, however, for what is known as “bill-and-hold” transactions.  If a 

transaction meets the criteria for “bill-and-hold” treatment, the seller may be permitted to 

recognize the revenue under GAAP before delivery of the product to the customer.  

       15.     For a transaction to qualify as “bill-and-hold” (thus allowing revenue recognition 

under GAAP before delivery to the customer), the following criteria must be satisfied:  (i) the             

buyer, not the seller, requests that the transaction be on a bill-and-hold basis, (ii) the buyer has a 

substantial business purpose for ordering on a bill-and-hold basis, (iii) there is a fixed delivery 

schedule that is reasonable and consistent with the buyer’s business purpose, (iv) the seller does  

                                                5 

---------------------Page 6---------------------

not retain any specific performance obligations such that the earnings process is incomplete, and 

(v) the products are ready for shipment. 

       16.     From at least 2002 through 2007, Diebold designated numerous of its sales 

contracts as “F-term” orders, or “Factory” orders.  Diebold recognized revenue on F-term orders 

when the products were shipped from Diebold’s factory to a Diebold warehouse, rather than when 

the products were delivered and installed at the customer’s location.  Thus, Diebold recognized 

revenue under all of its F-term  orders on a bill-and-hold basis. 

       17.     To satisfy the delivery requirement under GAAP, as described above, recognition 

of revenue when the products were shipped from Diebold’s factory to its warehouse – such as in  

Diebold’s F-term orders – would only be proper if those transactions met the criteria for bill-and-

hold transactions. 

                      Diebold Improperly Used Bill-and-hold Accounting 

       18.     As detailed below, during at least the period of 2002 through early 2007, Diebold 

routinely recognized revenue on products before the company delivered the products to the 

customer (i.e., under F-term orders), even though many of those transactions did not meet the bill-

and-hold criteria for doing so.  As a result, Diebold prematurely recognized material amounts of 

revenue and earnings.  This caused Diebold’s reported financial results to be materially false and 

misleading.   

       19.       Geswein, Krakora, and Miller knew or were reckless in not knowing that Diebold 

systematically recognized revenue on F-term orders prematurely, in violation of GAAP, and that, 

therefore, Diebold’s reports filed with the Commission, as well as Diebold’s press releases and 

other statements to the public, made false and misleading statements and omissions of material fact  

about Diebold’s financial performance. 

                                               6

         Case: 5:10-cv-01235  Doc #: 1   Filed:  06/02/10  7 of 36.  PageID #: 7  

       20.     Geswein and Krakora knew or were reckle   ss in not knowing that F-term orders did 

not meet the bill-and-hold criteria, but did not want to eliminate this improper accounting because 

it would reduce Diebold’s reported revenue in the short-term, and also force the disclosure of  

Diebold’s widespread bill-and-hold practices.  

       21.     After the Commission’s Staff Accounting Bulletin 104 was published in 

December 2003 (which, among other things, reiterated the criteria for bill-and-hold accounting), 

Defendants became concerned that Diebold’s revenue recognition practices would not withstand  

scrutiny. 

       22.     Beginning in 2004, Defendants carried out plans to create and rely on form 

documents that purported to show that many of Diebold’s sales supposedly met the criteria for 

bill-and-hold revenue recognition under GAAP, even though the Defendants knew or were 

reckless in not knowing that the documents were untrue in many transactions, and those 

transactions did not legitimately qualify for bill-and-hold treatment. 

       23.     For example, in early 2004, Krakora, with Miller’s assistance, redrafted the 

company’s form sales contract, known as a Memorandum of Agreement (“MOA”) in an effort to 

make it appear that Diebold customers using the MOA were requesting a product on a bill-and-

hold basis for the customer’s business purposes even if the customers had not actually requested 

this and/or did not have a business purpose for bill-and-hold. 

       24.      Geswein, Krakora, and Miller knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that 

notwithstanding the revisions to the MOA, the transactions did not meet the criteria for bill-and-

hold treatment to recognize revenue under GAAP because, for example, customers were not 

generally requesting products on a bill-and-hold basis, and bill-and-hold treatment was not being 

used for the customers’ own business purposes.   Thus, Geswein, Krakora and Miller knew or 

                                               7

          Case: 5:10-cv-01235  Doc #: 1   Filed:  06/02/10  8 of 36.  PageID #: 8  

were reckless in not knowing that Diebold could not properly recognize revenue before delivery 

of the products to the customer.   

                    Improperly Converting Contracts to Bill-and-Hold Status 

       25.     In 2004, Krakora and Miller also drafted a standard form contract to convert “I-

term” orders – orders for which Diebold recognized revenue upon installation at the customer 

site – to purported bill-and-hold transactions.  With regard to customers who agreed to sign this 

form at Diebold’s request, rather than at the customer’s request and for the customer’s business 

purposes, Diebold improperly recognized revenue on the transaction when the product was 

shipped from Diebold’s factory to its warehouse.   

       26.     As discussed previously, the accounting criteria for bill-and-hold transactions 

require that, in order for Diebold to recognize revenue before delivery to the customer, the 

customer – not Diebold – must request that the transaction be on a bill-and-hold basis, and the 

buyer must have a substantial business purpose for ordering on a bill-and-hold basis.   

       27.     Contrary to the above requirements for bill-and-hold accounting, Geswein, 

Krakora, and other Diebold management encouraged its sales force to request that customers  

execute the forms to convert “I-term” orders to bill-and-hold transactions.  Geswein and Krakora 

often did this on “make the quarter” calls, notwithstanding concerns raised by sales personnel.  For          

example, in June 2005, a Diebold sales manager wrote an email that was forwarded to Krakora 

stating that the sales staff was “trying to help Diebold’s revenue recognition drive,” but raised 

concerns about asking customers to sign bill-and-hold forms in instances when Diebold was at 

fault for installation delays.  Krakora took no action at the time to correct this improper practice.  

Another employee responded to the sales manager’s original email stating:  “This is like the 

crazy aunt in the cellar no one wants to talk about.” 

                                                8

         Case: 5:10-cv-01235  Doc #: 1   Filed:  06/02/10  9 of 36.  PageID #: 9  

       28.     As an example of the improper efforts to create the false appearance that 

customers had requested bill-and-hold transactions in the fourth quarter of 2004, a Diebold sales 

representative had a customer, Charter One Bank (“Charter One”), sign a bill-and-hold form to 

convert a $4 million I-term order into a purported bill-and-hold transaction.  The sales  

representative was carrying out instructions from his superiors to get a bill-and-hold form from  

Charter One, rather than responding to a request from Charter One for bill-and-hold treatment. 

       29.     In late 2004, Diebold personnel informed Geswein that Charter One would sign a 

bill-and-hold form but that Charter One was unwilling to actually pay for the equipment until it 

was installed.   

       30.     Geswein nevertheless instructed his subordinates to have Charter One sign the 

bill-and-hold form, even though he knew that Charter One had not requested bill-and-hold and 

would not pay until installation. 

       31.     The Charter One transaction did not meet the criteria for bill-and-hold treatment 

and recognition of the revenue from the sale in the fourth quarter of 2004. 

       32.     In a later conference call among Geswein and other Diebold personnel in early 

2005, Geswein was again told that Charter One had signed the bill-and-hold form (which by its 

terms required payment upon receipt of the invoice sent when Diebold shipped the products to its 

own warehouse), but that Charter One would not pay for the ATMs before they were installed.  

Geswein’s response was that the company should take the revenue, and “we’ll worry about the 

receivables later.”  Geswein thus caused Diebold to improperly recognize revenue on the 

transaction in the fourth quarter of 2004. 

       33.     Geswein knew or was reckless in not knowing that Diebold could not properly 

recognize the revenue from the Charter One transaction in the fourth quarter of 2004.  Even 

                                               9

        Case: 5:10-cv-01235  Doc #: 1   Filed:  06/02/10  10 of 36.  PageID #: 10  

though Charter One was invoiced in the fourth quarter of 2004, it did not pay for this transaction 

until the second quarter of 2005 (after Diebold delivered and installed the products).  This 

transaction inflated Diebold’s earnings in the fourth quarter of 2004 by about $2 million. 

       34.     By prematurely including the revenue from the Charter One transaction, Diebold 

was able to report that it met the low end of its projected earnings for the fourth quarter of 2004.  

Without the revenue from the Charter One transaction in that quarter, Diebold would have 

missed its projected earnings.         

       35.     Geswein announced Diebold’s revenues and earnings for the fourth quarter of 

2004 in a conference call with analysts on January 26, 2005.  On or about March 4, 2005, 

Geswein signed Diebold’s Form 10-K for 2004, which also reported Diebold revenues and 

earnings for the fourth quarter of 2004.  Geswein knew or was reckless in not knowing that 

financial figures Diebold announced and reported were materially false and misleading because, 

among other things, they included prematurely recognized revenue from the transaction 

described above.       

               Improperly Recognizing Revenue Regarding Incomplete Products 

       36.     By at least 2005, Krakora and Miller knew or were reckless in not knowing that 

many of Diebold’s supposed bill-and-hold sales of ATMs failed to meet another of the bill-and-

hold criteria:  That the products must be complete and that the seller must not retain any specific 

performance obligations.  In fact, many of the ATMs sold under purported bill-and-hold terms 

were not complete because key software had not been loaded by the time that Diebold 

recognized revenue from the sales.  Krakora and Miller knew, or were reckless in not knowing, 

that Diebold was prematurely recognizing revenue on such incomplete products.   

           Improperly Recognizing Revenue For Professional Services and Upgrades

       37.     Additionally, by at least 2005, Krakora and Miller knew or were reckless in not 

knowing that Diebold was recognizing revenue for professional services and upgrades on a bill-

and-hold basis.   Krakora and Miller knew, or  were reckless in not knowing, that revenue cannot 

be recognized on services and upgrades on a bill-and-hold basis.       

                                   “Pulling in” F-Term orders 

       38.     At certain times during the period 2004 through 2006, in connection with 

Diebold’s efforts to meet its earnings forecasts, Geswein and Krakora resorted to recognizing 

revenue even earlier on some F-term orders by directing the manufacturing and shipment of 

products to the warehouse before the shipment dates contained in the MOAs.  Diebold would 

then record revenue on the products it shipped to its warehouse early.  This practice was known 

as “pulling in” F-terms. 

       39.     The amount of F-term orders “pulled in” varied by quarter, but in many instances 

was done purposely to inflate earnings in order to meet forecasts.  In these instances, Geswein 

and Krakora instructed Diebold’s manufacturing personnel to manufacture products early, 

without customer notice or approval, for the purpose of recognizing revenue in an earlier 

reporting period.  For example, in June 2004 (the last month of the second quarter), Diebold 

“pulled in” about $3.4 million of F-term orders that were scheduled to be shipped to the 

warehouse in July 2004, and in December 2004 (the last month of the fourth quarter), Diebold 

“pulled in” about $3.8 million of F-term orders that were scheduled to ship to the warehouse in 

January 2005.   These “pull ins” inflated Diebold’                                    s earnings in these quarters by about $1.1 

million and about $1.3 million, respectively.

        Case: 5:10-cv-01235  Doc #: 1   Filed:  06/02/10  12 of 36.  PageID #: 12  

       40.      Geswein and Krakora knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that “pulling in” 

F-term orders was not in accordance with GAAP,  and that Diebold was prematurely recognizing 

revenue on these transactions and, therefore, falsely reporting its revenues and earnings.   

                         The $7.5 Million Revenue Recognition Reserve 

       41.     In January 2004, as part of its 2003 year-end audit, Diebold’s auditor tested a 

sample of Diebold’s 2003 bill-and-hold transactions.  This testing found that Diebold had 

prematurely recognized revenue on certain transactions, and that in certain instances Diebold had 

recognized revenue on transactions inconsistent with company policy.  In response, Diebold 

established a reserve representing $7.5 million of profit margin in the last quarter of 2003.  This 

reserve was derived by extrapolating the errors found in the auditor’s sample.   

       42.     In February 2004, Krakora and Miller learned that Diebold had prematurely 

recognized revenue in the fourth quarter of 2003, on a $5.2 million order from PNC Bank.  This 

had not been identified as an error by the company’s auditor during its testing.  Notwithstanding, 

Krakora and Miller did not correct this error or adjust the $7.5 million profit margin reserve that 

the company had established to account for errors the auditor had found during its audit, even 

though this error demonstrated that the reserve was inadequate.  

       43.     Krakora and Miller knew or were reckless in not knowing that GAAP required 

Diebold to correct the applicable 2003 financial statements to reflect the effect of this known 

error of $5.2 million.  Yet, Krakora and Miller failed to do so.    

                          Improper “Smoothing” of Earnings Impact 

       44.     In 2004, when Defendants began using the revised MOA, Geswein and Krakora 

knew that this would result in fewer F-term orders and less revenue in 2004, as it was envisioned 

that many customers would not agree to the new terms.   

                                               12

        Case: 5:10-cv-01235  Doc #: 1   Filed:  06/02/10  13 of 36.  PageID #: 13  

       45.     To improperly “smooth” the negative impact to earnings from these changes, 

Geswein and Krakora decided to stagger the implementation of the new practices.  Starting in 

April 2004, Diebold started applying the new practices to orders from its larger national bank 

customers.  Diebold decided to wait until July 2004 to apply the practices to orders from its 

smaller regional bank customers.  
                                   

       46.     However, certain Diebold personnel began applying the new revenue recognition 

practices to some regional bank orders earlier than Geswein and Krakora had planned, resulting 

in fewer orders being designated as F-term, and thus less revenue being recognized early.  

Geswein and Krakora discovered this and realized that the company would not meet its earnings 

forecast for the third quarter of 2004.  In or about August and September 2004, Geswein and 

Krakora instructed Diebold financial personnel to make a significant “top line” journal entry that 

would prematurely and artificially pull revenue into the third quarter of 2004 with regard to sales 

that, based upon the new bill-and-hold procedures, actually would not generate revenue until 

later.  In accordance with Geswein’s and Krakora’s direction, Diebold financial personnel made 

an $18.8 million top line journal entry that prematurely recognized revenue that otherwise would 

not and should not have been recognized until later quarters.  

       47.     As a result of this improper $18.8 top line entry, Diebold met its revised earnings 

forecast in the third quarter of 2004.  Geswein and Krakora knew, or were reckless in not 

knowing, that the making of such a top line entry had no accounting basis, violated GAAP, and 

was solely used to “smooth” or mitigate the impact of Diebold’s 2004 revenue recognition 

changes.

                      False and Misleading Statements and Omissions of 

                       Material Fact Involving Bill-and-Hold Accounting 

                                                 
       48.     Diebold’s premature recognition of revenue on certain F-term orders, based upon 

the many improper actions of Defendants Geswein, Krakora and Miller, described above, 

resulted in revenue and earnings misstatements in each of Diebold’s quarterly and annual 

financial statements from 2003 through the first quarter of 2007.  In 2003 alone, Diebold 

overstated its earnings before taxes by $29.5 million (or over 11%) due to premature recognition 

of revenue on supposed bill-and-hold transactions.  

       49.     In 2008, Diebold restated its financial statements for the reporting periods from  

2003 through the first quarter of 2007, and announced that going forward it would recognize 

revenue upon customer acceptance of goods or services, and not on an F-term basis.  In its 

restatement, Diebold retroactively applied this new revenue recognition policy which alone 

resulted in a decrease of the company’s total earnings before taxes of $56.2 million. 

       50.     As a result of the misuse of bill-and-hold accounting and the resulting premature 

recognition of revenue, as described above, Geswein and Krakora signed and caused Diebold to 

file materially false and misleading Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K with the Commission during the 

periods from 2003 through the first quarter of 2007, and made materially false and misleading 

statements and omissions of material fact in those reports, in statements in press releases issued 

to the public and in statements by Geswein and Krakora during conference calls with stock 

analysts. 

       51.     As a result of the foregoing, Geswein and Krakora knowingly or recklessly made 

misrepresentations or omissions of material fact when they signed Diebold’s Forms 10-K for the 

years 2003 and 2004 (signed by Geswein and Krakora), the Forms 10-K for the years 2005 and 

2006 (signed by Krakora), and each of Diebold’s Form 10-Q reports covering the quarterly 

                                              14

        Case: 5:10-cv-01235  Doc #: 1   Filed:  06/02/10  15 of 36.  PageID #: 15  

periods within those years and the first quarter of 2007.  Geswein and Krakora also made 

materially false and misleading statements and omissions of material fact in statements in press 

releases issued to the public and in statements by Geswein and Krakora during conference calls 

with stock analysts with regard to those same periods of time.  

       52.     As Geswein and Krakora knew or were reckless in not knowing, those reports and 

statements contained false and misleading statements and omissions of material fact about 

Diebold’s revenues and earnings, and failed to disclose the material facts surrounding Diebold’s 

use of bill-and-hold accounting, including but not necessarily limited to the fact that Diebold was 

improperly using bill-and-hold accounting, that Diebold had prematurely recognized material 

amounts of revenue and was not complying with GAAP requirements, that Diebold changed its 

procedures and documentation for bill-and-hold transactions in 2004 and anticipated a significant 

drop in revenue as a result, and that in 2004 Diebold was staggering its implementation of its 

revised policies regarding revenue recognition in order to smooth earnings and hide the impact of 

its changed policies. 

       53.     As examples of the foregoing, on or about February 27, 2004, Geswein and 

Krakora signed Diebold’s Form 10-K for 2003, on or about August 12, 2005, Geswein and 

Krakora signed a restatement of Diebold’s income for 2003, and on or about March 13, 2006, 

Krakora signed Diebold’s Form 10-K for 2005, all of which stated Diebold’s revenues and 

earnings for years including 2003.  Each of those reports – which were filed with the 

Commission – materially overstated Diebold’s revenues and earnings figures for 2003 because 

they included material amounts of revenue and earnings from bill-and-hold transactions that did 

meet the applicable criteria.  For example, according to Diebold’s 2008 restatement, Diebold’s 

                                              15

net income for 2003 had been overstated by $29.5  million attributable to improper bill-and-hold 

accounting. 

       54.     
               Miller, as Director of Corporate Accounting, was responsible along with Geswein 

and Krakora for ensuring that Diebold’s revenue recognition policies, including its policies 

regarding bill-and-hold, complied with GAAP, and for overseeing Diebold’s filings with the 

Commission.  Miller, acting knowingly or recklessly, through actions including but not 

necessarily limited to those described above, participated in and helped enable the practices by 

which Diebold misused bill-and-hold accounting and by which Diebold made the resulting 

materially false and misleading statements and omissions of material fact in reports filed with the 

Commission as discussed herein. 

   Recognition of Revenue on a Lease Agreement Subject to a Side Buy-back Agreement  
        
       55.     Under GAAP, the full amount of revenue from a transaction cannot be recognized 

if the transaction is subject to significant future obligations or contingencies, such as a buy-back 

agreement. 

       56.     As detailed below, Geswein and Krakora participated in a scheme to prematurely 

recognize revenue from a transaction that was subject to a buy-back agreement.  

       57.     In the first quarter of 2005, Diebold entered into an agreement to lease a portfolio 

of ATMs located in WalMart stores to a private company, Cash Depot, for $5 million.  In this 

transaction, Diebold entered into a side agreement with Cash Depot, giving Cash Depot the right 

to “sell” the ATMs back to Diebold at a later date.  

       58.     Geswein agreed to the buy-back provision when he met with Cash Depot’s CEO to  

negotiate the transaction in the first quarter of 2005.  Geswein told the Diebold sales representative 

working on the transaction to speak with Krakora about how to draft the agreement with Cash 

                                              16

Depot with a buy-back provision, so that the company ostensibly could still recognize all the 

revenue from the transaction in the first quarter of 2005.   

       59.     In the first quarter of 2005, Krakora advised the Diebold sales representative that 

two agreements would be needed:  an agreement for the sale of the ATMs to Cash Depot and a  

separate side agreement regarding the buy-back provision.  After meeting with Krakora, the sales 

representative told Geswein that Krakora said that a separate side agreement regarding the buy-

back provision was needed for revenue recognition in the first quarter of 2005.  
                                                                              

       60.     Because the Cash Depot transaction was subject to significant future obligations 

or contingencies (i.e., the buy-back agreement), it was improper under GAAP for Diebold to 

recognize the entire $5 million in revenue on this transaction in the first quarter of 2005.  

       61.     Geswein and Krakora failed to inform Diebold’s auditors of the existence of the 

side agreement with Cash Depot. 

       62.     Notwithstanding the foregoing, Diebold improperly recognized all $5 million in 

revenue on this transaction in the first quarter of 2005.  Approximately $3.3 million of that 

amount represented earnings, which accounted for approximately 8% of Diebold’s total pretax 

earnings that quarter. 

       63.     At all relevant times, Geswein and Krakora knew, or were reckless in not 

knowing, that Diebold was recognizing the $5 million in revenue from the Cash Depot 

transaction, that the sale was subject to a buy-back agreement, and that therefore the company’s 

recognition of the full amount of revenue and earnings on the transaction was improper.    

       64.     As a result of the foregoing, Diebold’s revenue and earnings figures for the first 

quarter of 2005 were materially false and misleading.  Geswein, knowingly or recklessly, gave 

such false and misleading figures to the public through various means, including but not 

                                               17

necessarily limited to Diebold’s Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2005, which was signed by 

Geswein on or about May 5, 2005, as well as in a conference call with analysts on April 20, 

2005.  Geswein knew or was reckless in not knowing that the Form 10-Q and his statements 

were materially false and misleading in that they included the $5 million in revenue and resulting 

earnings from the Cash Depot transaction, which could not all properly be included under 

GAAP, and he failed to disclose that the Cash Depot transaction was subject to the side  

agreement, as described above. 

                            Manipulating Reserves and Accruals  

       65.     Under GAAP, an issuer is required to                 accrue for anticipated liabilities, and a  

liability should only be released in appropriate circumstances such as the occurrence of a 

specified event or when the estimate should be revised in response to new information.  

Moreover, maintaining general or excess reserves (i.e., cookie jar reserves) is prohibited under 

GAAP. 

       66.     From 2002 to 2006, as discussed below, Geswein, Krakora, and Miller routinely 

manipulated Diebold’s reserves and accruals in order to manage earnings in violation of GAAP 

requirements, as detailed below. 

                                   Under-accrued Liabilities 

       67.     During the relevant time period, Geswein, Krakora and Miller inflated Diebold’s 

earnings by failing to accrue for known liabilities, in violation of GAAP.  As detailed below, this 

caused Diebold’s financial results to be materially inflated.  

       68.     For example, Geswein and Krakora knew, or were reckless in not knowing, the 

liability account for the company’s Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) – an employee benefit 

plan intended to reward long term company performance – was under-accrued for much of 2002 

and 2003.  For example, in a May 9, 2003 email from Krakora to Geswein, Krakora explained 

                                              18

        Case: 5:10-cv-01235  Doc #: 1   Filed:  06/02/10  19 of 36.  PageID #: 19  

that “GAAP requires variable accounting for the LTIP, so technically each quarter we should be 

adjusting the accrual to reflect expected shares to be earned on a pro-rata basis times the price of 

the stock at quarter-end.” 
                           In fact, as Krakora knew, Diebold was not making the required 

adjustments each quarter.  Moreover, at the time of this email, Krakora’s calculations indicated 

that the LTIP accrual was under-accrued by at least $5 million.    

       69.     In order to accrue for the LTIP in 2003 without negatively impacting earnings, 

Diebold, through the actions of Defendants, offset the liability by improperly reducing other 

accounts, including an unreconciled accounts payable account and an unreconciled deferred 

revenue account. 

       70.     For example, in May 2003, Miller, acting in concert with Geswein and Krakora, 

made a manual journal entry in which she funded the LTIP accrual by reducing an inventory 

account even though, contrary to the requirements of GAAP, she had no accounting basis to 

justify reducing the inventory account. 

       71.     Miller made another improper entry by reducing the deferred revenue account 

(internally named “Account 270”) to fund the LTIP reserve.  One of Miller’s staff members 

raised questions concerning the proposed entry.  Notwithstanding these questions, Miller made 

the inappropriate entry. 

       72.     Geswein, Krakora and Miller knew or were reckless in not knowing that making 

improper journal entries regarding such accrual accounts was in violation of GAAP and would 

cause the revenues and/or earnings that Diebold reported to the public to be overstated and false. 

       73.     In 2003 alone, Geswein, Krakora, and Miller’s manipulation of various accrual 

accounts had the effect of improperly under-accruing Diebold’s liabilities, and overstating 

Diebold’s reported pre-tax earnings by at least $16 million.  
                                                                
                                                               

                                               19

       74.     By reason of the foregoing, as a result of the actions of Geswein, Krakora and 

Miller, Diebold’s statements of its earnings for 2003 were materially false and misleading.  Such 

statements were included in Diebold’s Form  10-K for 2003, which Geswein and Krakora signed 

on or about February 27, 2004, and were included in a restatement of Diebold’s income for 2003,  

which Geswein and Krakora signed on or about August 12, 2005, and in the Form 10-K for 

2005, which Krakora signed on or about March 13, 2006. 

       75.      From at least 2002 through 2005, Geswein knew, or was reckless in not 

knowing, that Diebold, in violation of GAAP,  failed to properly accrue for other liabilities, 

including its North American sales commission accrual (commissions to be paid to sales 

personnel) and its team incentive accrual (incentive pay to be paid to service personnel).  In 

2005, Diebold restated its financial statements to correct errors in certain accounts for the years 

2002 to 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, including the North American sales commission 

accrual account (which in 2005 had been materially underaccrued by $11.4 million).      

       76.     Prior to the 2005 restatement, a Diebold vice president had informed Geswein that 

the commission accrual account was materially underaccrued.  Geswein took no action to correct 

the underaccrual. 

       77.     In 2005 and thereafter, as detailed below, Geswein and Krakora made statements 

to the public that were materially false and misleading in that they misrepresented and failed to 

disclose the truth about the commission accrual account and its impact on Diebold’s finances.  

These false statements and omissions include but are not necessary limited to the following 

instances:  

              (a)     On June 30, 2005, Geswein signed a Form 8-K stating that “the company 

       has identified a reconciliation issue in its North American sales commission accrual 

                                               20

       account.”  Geswein further stated on a conference call with analysts that same day that 

       “during management’s review of the second quarter, we noted an error in the 

       reconciliation process of the North American commission accrual.”  He also said “it’s  

       something that, certainly, the process is in place and documentation is in place, but 

       mechanically, the reconciliations weren’t doing the job.”  Geswein knew, or was reckless 

       in not knowing, that his representations in the June 30, 2005 Form 8-K and conference 

       call were materially misleading because the sales commission accrual account was 

       underaccrued due to his desire to meet forecasted targets, not due to an “error” or  

       “reconciliations [that] weren’t doing the job.”  

              (b)     On August 15, 2005, Krakora signed Diebold’s Form 10-Q for the second 

       quarter of 2005, stating that the company needed to restate its financial statements due to 

       a “reconciliation issue in its North America sales commission accrual account.”  On 

       November 4, 2005, Krakora signed Diebold’s Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2005, 

       which repeated the misleading information that the need to restate Diebold’s financial 

       statements was due to a “reconciliation issue.”  Krakora knew, or was reckless in not 

       knowing, that his representations were materially false and misleading because the sales 

       commission accrual account was underaccrued due to a desire to meet forecasted targets, 

       not due to a “reconciliation issue.”   

                                      Cookie Jar Reserves 

       78.     Geswein, Krakora, and Miller used “cookie jar” reserves to manage earnings, in 

violation of GAAP.  As described above, Diebold established a reserve of profit margin of $7.5 

million in the last quarter of 2003.  Over the course of 2004, acting in concert with Geswein and 

Krakora, Miller released the reserve to fill shortfalls in operating results.  Geswein, Krakora and 

                                               21

Miller knew or were reckless in not knowing that releasing the reserve in order to cover 

shortfalls in operating results, rather than based upon a legitimate accounting basis, was in 

violation of GAAP. 

       79.     Miller, acting in concert with Geswein and Krakora, released $1 million of the 

$7.5 million reserve in the first quarter 2004, $1.25 million in the second quarter of 2004, and the 

remaining $5.25 million in the third quarter of 2004.  As a result, Diebold exactly met analyst 

earnings consensus for the first two quarters and the revised analyst earnings consensus in the 

third quarter. 

       80.     Geswein, Krakora, and Miller knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that these 

entries had no legitimate accounting basis, and they were recorded to fraudulently manage 

Diebold’s reported earnings.  
                               

       81.     Geswein, Krakora and Miller knew or were reckless in not knowing that making 

improper journal entries regarding such accrual accounts would cause the revenues and/or 

earnings that Diebold reported to the public to be overstated and false.    

       82.     In another example, in or about January 2004, Miller, acting in concert with 

Krakora and Geswein, established a $4.5 million corporate obsolescence and excess inventory 

account effective December 31, 2003.  This corporate inventory account was used as a cookie jar 

reserve that Geswein, Krakora, and Miller knew, or were reckless in not knowing, had no 

legitimate accounting basis and violated GAAP.   

                       Improperly Delaying and Capitalizing Expenses  

                                   Division 35 and CAP 250 

       83.     As detailed below, Diebold failed to recognize certain expenses as incurred, and 

instead improperly deferred these expenses or spread the expenses over several reporting 

periods, which artificially increased net income in several fiscal years.  With regard to recording 

                                               22

expenses, Geswein had a saying he used with subordinates: “take it by the drink.” The 

expression meant that instead of recording the whole expense, Diebold would recognize its 

expenses a drink at a time.  Diebold engaged in improper expense deferrals in at least two 

accounts:  the “Division 35” and “CAP 250” accounts. 

       84.     Division 35 was a finished goods inventory account.  From 2003 through 2005, 

Geswein and Krakora knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that the value of the account was 

overstated.  Various meetings had taken place in which Geswein and Krakora discussed that the 

Division 35 account had a large unexplained balance, and that the account needed to be 

reconciled. 

       85.     Nevertheless, Diebold improperly failed to reconcile the account until 2005.  

Then, in 2005, instead of restating its prior financial statements to correct the material errors in 

the account and record expenses in the proper reporting periods as required under GAAP, 

Diebold spread $15 million of expenses over two quarters in 2005.  
                                                                     

       86.      Geswein and Krakora knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that the 

overstatement of the Division 35 account inflated Diebold’s earnings by $4.3 million in 2003, 

and more than $6.2 million in periods prior to 2003. 

       87.     CAP 250 was an installation accounting system, primarily consisting of two 

accounts accruing for the cost of installation.  Geswein and Krakora knew, or were reckless in 

not knowing, that the overstatement of this CAP 250 account inflated Diebold’s earnings by $2.1 

million in 2004, $2.2 million in 2003, and $4.4 million in periods prior to 2003.     

                                      The Oracle Project 

       88.     In 2002, Diebold began a project to replace many of its older internal software 

systems with Oracle software.  Under GAAP, capitalization of a software asset requires 

companies to properly capture internal and external costs involved with the various stages of 

                                               23

software development.  Consequently, Diebold was permitted to capitalize certain costs 

associated with the Oracle project.  However, from 2003 through 2006, Diebold improperly 

capitalized costs that should have been expensed in the periods they were incurred. 

       89.     In certain quarters when Diebold’s earnings were short of forecast, Miller, acting 

in concert with Geswein and Krakora, made top-level entries to fraudulently capitalize additional 

expenses to the Oracle project.  These improper “additions,” which often were round numbers 

such as $1 million, had the effect of materially reducing reported expenses, and thus increasing 

reported earnings.  Geswein, Krakora, and Miller knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that 

Diebold had been improperly capitalizing expenses related to the Oracle project since at least 

2004.  For example, Miller made top-level entries to increase capitalization of Oracle expenses in  

the amounts of  $1 million effective September 30, 2004, and $1.6 million effective March 31, 

2005. 

       90.     Diebold’s improper capitalization of expenses to the Oracle project increased 

Diebold’s pre-tax earnings in 2003, 2004, and 2005, by at least $0.5 million, $3 million, and $6.8 

million, respectively.      

       91.     Geswein, Krakora, and Miller knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that making 

such improper journal entries would cause the revenue and/or earnings figures reported by 

Diebold to the public to be overstated and false.  

                                 Used Equipment Write-Ups  

       92.     Under GAAP, used equipment inventory should be valued at the lower of cost or 

market value.  From 2003 to 2005, Diebold often improperly “wrote-up” the value of certain used 

inventory, such as used ATMs.  These “write-ups” had the effect of reducing cost of goods sold 

and thus inflating earnings, and were used by Geswein and Krakora in order to meet earnings 

forecasts.

       93.     For example, in the second quarter of 2004, Geswein and Krakora directed the 

write-up of value of used equipment inventory by $1 million (and thus increased net income by 

$1 million) to inflate earnings to meet forecasts.   

       94.     Miller improperly booked this $1 million entry without any legitimate accounting 

basis. 

       95.     Furthermore, Diebold improperly wrote up the value of other used equipment 

inventory (and inflated earnings) by $750,000 in the fourth quarter of 2004, $1.2 million in the 

first quarter of 2005, and $1 million in the second quarter of 2005.   

       96.     Geswein, Krakora, and Miller knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that these 

used equipment “write-ups,” which were listed on several “opportunity lists,” had no legitimate 

accounting basis, violated GAAP and were used improperly to inflate Diebold’s earnings.  

       97.     Geswein, Krakora, and Miller knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that the 

making of such improper journal entries would cause the revenue and/or earnings figures 

reported by Diebold to the public to be overstated and false.   

                                 Diebold’s 2008 Restatement  

       98.     As result of Diebold management’s improper, and in many instances fraudulent, 

accounting practices from at least 2002 to 2007, the financial statements that Diebold 

incorporated into its periodic filings and other materials disseminated to the investing public 

were materially false and misleading.  Diebold’s improper accounting practices significantly 

inflated the company’s reported earnings.  To correct the more recent misstatements, on 

September 30, 2008, Diebold restated its financial statements for the years 2003 through 2006, 

and the first quarter of 2007, in its Form 10-K for 2007.

                      Impact of the Defendants’ Fraudulent Schemes–
  
                  Materially Misleading Financial Reports and Statements
  
                                                 
       99.     The improper accounting entries that resulted from all of Defendants’ improper 

schemes as discussed above were material, individually or collectively.  This caused Diebold’s 

statements of its revenues and/or earnings from at least 2003 through the first quarter of 2007 to 

present a materially false and misleading picture of Diebold’s financial performance.  Such 

statements appeared in Diebold’s Forms 8-K, 10-K,  and10-Q filed with the Commission and 

available to the public, appeared in other presentations of Diebold’s finances in press releases 

distributed to the public, and were stated in conference calls with stock analysts with respect to 

that time period. 

       100.    The false statements about Diebold’s revenues and/or earnings, which resulted 

from the conduct of Geswein, Krakora and Miller, as described above, included but are not 

limited to the false reports and statements described above, and the following additional 

examples: 

              (a)     After Diebold announced its fourth quarter 2003 earnings results, on 

       January 28, 2004, Geswein stated on a conference call with investment analysts, “let me  

       echo Wally’s sentiments of how pleased we are to report record revenue and profits with 

       EPS of 81 cents per share, which is near the high end of our previous guidance of 78 

       cents to 83 cents per share.”  Diebold’s Form 10-K for 2003 (signed by Geswein and 

       Krakora on or about February 27, 2004), repeated the EPS figure of $0.81 for the fourth 

       quarter of 2003.   However, Diebold’s earnings would not have met the company’s  

       previous guidance without Miller’s improper manual journal entries made in concert with 

       Geswein and Krakora.  Miller made a $14.8 million entry to an unreconciled deferred  

       revenue account and an $8.5 million entry to an unreconciled accounts payable account, 

                                              26

increasing Diebold’s pre-tax income by over $23 million.  Without these journal entries, 

Diebold’s reported fourth quarter 2003 EPS would have been about 25% lower, which 

would have been well outside its previous guidance range.  

       (b)    After Diebold announced its fourth quarter 2004 earnings results, on 

January 26, 2005, Geswein stated on a conference call with investment analysts, “We are 

pleased to report record revenue, earnings, and free cash flow for the quarter.  Reported 

revenue was $717 million, up 10.6 percent while reported EPS was 87 cents, an increase 

of 7.4 percent and within previous guidance of 87 to 92 cents a share.”  However, 

Diebold’s earnings would not have been within Diebold’s previous guidance but for 

several of the Defendants’ fraudulent schemes described above.  For example, Diebold’s 

pre-tax income was increased by over $8 million by “pulling-in” $1.3 million of earnings 

from F-term transactions, switching orders from F-terms to I-terms resulting in an 

increase in $5.6 million of earnings, writing-up inventory by $750,000, and improperly 

capitalizing $1 million of expenses related to the Oracle project.   Without these entries,  

Diebold’s fourth quarter 2004 EPS would have been over 10% lower, and would have 

been well outside its previous guidance range. 

       (c)    In Diebold’s Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2005 (signed by Geswein 

on or about May 5, 2005), the company reported EPS of $.37, which met its earnings 

forecast for that quarter of $.35 to $.40.  Diebold’s reported EPS was inflated by 

improper transactions and accounting entries described above, including but not 

necessarily limited to the premature recognition of revenue from the Cash Depot 

transaction, improper capitalization of expenses on the Oracle project, and improper 

reversal of a portion of the “cookie jar” excess and obsolescence reserve.  Without this 

                                       27

       fraudulent accounting, Diebold’s reported EPS would have been well below the quarterly 

       earnings forecast. 

                           Geswein and Krakora Misled Auditors  
 
       101.    Throughout their scheme, Geswein and Krakora misled Diebold’s external 

auditors by making materially false and misleading statements and omissions in connection with 

the quarterly reviews and annual audits of the financial statements.  Geswein and Krakora 

submitted management representation letters to the auditors with respect to the annual and 

quarterly reports and financial statements referred to herein.  Geswein’s and Krakora’s letters 

concealed their numerous fraudulent schemes and made false statements which included that the 

affected quarterly and annual financial statements were presented in conformity with GAAP and 

that they had no knowledge of any fraud that could have a material effect on the financial 

statements. 

                        Krakora and Geswein Received Bonuses and 

                  Other Incentive-Based and Equity-Based Compensation
  
                                                    
       102.    During the 12-month period following the issuance of Diebold’s 2003 financial 

statements, Geswein received from the company incentive-based and equity-based compensation,  

including cash bonuses, shares of Diebold stock and stock options. 

       103.    During the 12-month period following the issuance of Diebold’s 2005 financial 

statements, Krakora received incentive-based and equity-based compensation, including cash 

bonuses, shares of Diebold stock and stock options.    

       104.    During the 12-month period following the issuance of Diebold’s 2006 financial 

statements, Krakora received incentive-based and/or equity-based compensation, including 

shares of Diebold stock and stock options.
