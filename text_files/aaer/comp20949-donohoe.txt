       The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") alleges the following against 

Defendant John A. Donohoe, Jr.: 

                             SUMMARY      OF ALLEGATIONS 

       1.     From 1999 until 2004, Defendant and other former officers and employees at 

MedQuist Inc. (''MedQuist'' or ''the Company"), a New Jersey-based medical transcription company, 

claimed in SEC filings, press releases and earnings calls that the Company's strong financial 

performance was due to its disciplined and conservative business practices, while at the same time it 

was systematically and secretly inflating customer bills to increase revenues and profit margins. From 

late 1998untilMarch2002, Defendantwas a Director, President, andChiefOperatingOfficer of 

MedQuist. Beginning in about 1999, Defendant and others caused MedQuist to fraudulently overbill 

customers by increasing the number oflines ofmedical text it purportedly transcnbed. The scheme 

was able to continue for several years because the unit ofmeasure upon which bills to many customers 

were based-known   as an "AAMT" line-included invisible characters and computer keystrokes that 
---------------------Page 2---------------------

could not be verified by customers.  Knowing that customers were unable   to verifY line counts on bills, 

Defendant and others in the Company directed it  to stop counting AAMT lines and secretly use 

fonnulas to increase line counts on customer bills to reach specific revenue and margin targets. 

        2.      Defendant and others within the Company misled customers and independent auditors 

into believing that the Company's  bills were based on AAMT   line counts as required by customer 

contracts. At the same time, Defendant and others within the Company misled shareholders and the 

public by stating in Commission filings, press releases and earnings calls, that the Company's  revenues 

were based primarily on contracted rates and that its strong financial performance was the result of 

conservative and disciplined business practices. 

        3.      Since the billing scheme came to light in 2004, the  Company has set aside 

approximately $83 million to resolve customer billing issues. 

                                           VIOLATIONS 

        4.      By engaging  in the conduct descnbed  below, Defendant violated  Section 17(a) ofthe 

Securities Act  and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange  Act and Rules lOb-5, 

13b2-1, and 13b2-2  [15  U.S.C.  §§ 77q(a), 78j(b), and 78m(b)(5) and 17  c.F.R. §§ 240.10b-5, 

204.13b2-1,  and 240.13b-2-2], and aided and abetted violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 

13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20,  13a-l,   13a-ll, and 13a-13  [15 U.S.c.  §§ 78m(a), 

78m(b)(2)(A),  and 78m(b)(2)(B)  and 17  C.F.R. §§  204.l2b-20,  204.l3a-l, 240.13a-ll,  and 240.l3a­

13].

                                   JURISDICTION  AND         VENUE
 

        5.      The Connnission brings this action pursuant  to Sections 20(b), 20( d), and 20(e) ofthe 

Securities Act and Sections 21(d) and 21(e)  ofthe Exchange   Act  [15 U.S.C.  §§ 77t(b), 77t(d),  77t(e), 

78u(d), and 78u(e)], seeking  ajudgment: 

                a       Permanently restraining and enjoining the Defendant from further violations  of 

        the relevant provisions ofthe securities laws; 

                b.      Requiring Defendant   to pay a civil money penalty pursuant  to Section 20(d) of 

        the Securities Act and Section 21 (d) ofthe Exchange Act [15   U.S.c.  §§ 77t(d)] and §78u(d)]; 

        and 

                c.      ProhIbiting Defendant from acting as an officer or director of any issuer that 

        has a class ofsecurities registered under Section 12 ofthe Exchange Act [15   U.S.c.  §781] or 

        that is required to file reports by Section 15(d) ofthe Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §78o(d)]. 

        6.      The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant  to Sections 20(b), 20(d), 20(e) and 

22 ofthe Securities Act [15 U.S.C.  §§ 77t(b), 77t(d),  77t(e) and 77v] and Sections 21(d), 21(e), and 

27 ofthe Exchange Act [15 U.S.C.  §§ 78u(d), 78u(e),  and 78aa].  Venue is proper under Section 22     of 

the Securities Act [15 U.S.C.  § 77v] and Section 27 ofthe  Exchange Act [15   U.S.c.  § 78aa]. 

        7.      Defendant, directly or indirectly, made use ofthe means and instrumentalities  of 

interstate connnerce, ofthe mails, or ofthe facilities ofa national securities exchange in connection 

with the acts, practices, and courses ofbusiness alleged herein.  Certain ofthese transactions,  acts, 

practices and courses of business occurred  in the Southern District ofNew  York,   including, among 

other things, public sales ofMedQuist  stock on the NASDAQ  stock market based      in New  York  City.

                                            DEFENDANT
 

        8.      John  A.  Donohoe,  Jr., age 54, was President, Chief Operating Officer, and a Director 

ofMedQuist   from about August  1998 until March 2002.  Donohoe  resides in the Connnonwealth     of 

Pennsylvania 

                                     STATEMENT        OF  FACTS 

        9.      MedQuist  perfonns  medical transcription services by receiving dictated medical 

records  from customers, usually hospitals, and keying them into computer programs  called 

transcription pIatfonns.  MedQuist has contracts with its customers  governing how  MedQuist  will 

measure and bill the work.  Each contract specifies the unit (such as word, line, or report)  MedQuist 

uses to measure the work, the definition ofthe unit ofmeasure (such  as how  many characters 

constitute  a "line"), and the price per unit.  The contracts require that MedQuist bill the customer  an 

amount equal to the number ofunits  transcnbed  multiplied by the price per unit. 

        10.     From 1998 through 2002, many    of MedQuist' s contracts required MedQuist   to use a 

unit ofmeasure called the AAMT line.  MedQuist's  contracts defined an   AAMT    line as follows: 

        any line having 65 'characters,'  [where a] character is defined as any letter, number, 
        symbol or function key necessary for the :final appearance and content ofa document 
        including, without  limitation, the space bar, carriage return, underscore, bold, and any 
        character contained within the macro, header, or footer. A defined line is calculated by 
        counting all characters contained within a document  and simply dividing the total 
        number  of charactersby 65  to arrive at the number ofdefined lines. 

        11.     Because MedQuist's  contracts specifically stated that AAMT  lines would  be calculated 

by "counting all characters"  and "simply dividing ... by 65", MedQuist was required to count AAMT 

characters in order to bill in accordance with contracts. 

                                                   4 
---------------------Page 5---------------------

        12.     Because AAMT  lines include invisible characters  and formatting codes peculiar to the 

transcription  platforms, MedQuist's  customers  could not independently verifY the AAMT  line totals in 

their bills by looking at their transcnbed  documents. 

        13.     MedQuist  calculated transcriptionist pay by a unit ofmeasure called a ''payroll line," 

which was  not equal to an AAMT line. 

        14.     By  1999, Defendant directed that the Company stop actual counting    of AAMT 

characters  and lines. He directed Company officials to derive the number  of AAMT    lines billed to 

customers  by applying multiples to the number  of payroll lines in the customer's  work. 

        15.     Also by 1999, Defendant  directed that Company officials adjust the line count  multiples 

on customer  accounts  to reach desired revenue and margin targets.  Defendant routinely monitored   the 

effectof changes to line count multiples to ensure that the Company met its desired revenue and 

margin targets. 

        16.     The Company's  use   of and increases to line count multiples, instead ofcounting 

AAMT    characters  and lines as called for in customer  contracts, resulted in overbilling ofcertain 

customers. 

        17.     Neither Defendant  nor other MedQuist  officials told customers  or shareholders  about 

the use ofline count multiples for billing purposes.  Because thechanged methodology    had  the 

potential to increase billed lines counts enough to be noticed by customers,  Defendant directed or 

authorized Company officials to increase the line count multiples of some customers gradually over 

time.  Defendant directed or authorized  Company officials to sometimes secretly increase a customer's 

line  multiple after agreeing to a decrease  in line price, in order to maintain revenues  and profit margins. 

                                                    5
 
---------------------Page 6---------------------

        18.     Defendant knew,   or was  reckless in not knowing, that the Company was    not billing in 

accordance  with customer  contracts  and that the Company   was  increasing its billed line counts  to meet 

revenue and margin targets. 

        19.     Defendant knew,   or was reckless in not knowing, that  certain customers,  including 

those who had left MedQuist  for other transcription  providers,  complained of billing irregularities, 

unjustifiable bill totals, and billing fraud on the part ofthe Company. 

        20.     Defendant  failed to ensure the accuracy ofbilled  AAMT line counts   or the adequacy  of 

the Company's  internal controls surrounding  its billing systems. 

        21.     Defendant knew,   or was  reckless in not knowing, that the Company's  external  auditors 

believed incorrectly that Company transcription platforms actually counted   AAMT     characters  and 

lines, and that the auditors relied on that incorrect belief in performing their audit.  Defendant  failed to 

tell Company external auditors that no Company transcription  platforms actually counted    AAMT 

characters  and lines.  Defendant knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that  the Company   had 

inadequate  controls on its billing processes but did not tell the Company's  external auditors.  Defendant 

knew, or was  reckless in not knowing, that the Company was using line count  multiples   to reach 

revenue and margin targets but did  not tell the Company's  external auditors.  Defendant  knew  that 

certain customers had  complained  of billing irregularities and fraud but did not tell the auditors ofthese 

complaints.  Defendant knew,   or was  reckless in not knowing, that these omitted  disclosures were 

material to the auditors' work and public statements  about the Company.    In addition, Defendant 

signed written representations to the auditors that he knew, or was  reckless in not knowing,  were 

                                                    6
 
---------------------Page 7---------------------

misleading as to the completeness ofthe infonnation that the Company provided and as to the quality 

ofthe records underlying Company transactions and revenues. 

       22.     Defendant and others at MedQuist told shareholders and other public investors that the 

Company's strong financial perfonnance was due to disciplined and conservative business practices and 

that revenues were based primarily on contracted rates, while at the same time it was secretly not 

billing in accordance with contracts and was manipulating billed line counts to reach desired revenue 

and margin targets.  He knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that these statements and omissions 

were misleading and material in that a reasonable investor would consider them important to an 

investment decision about the Company. 

       23.     From 1999  to his departure from the Company in 2002, Donohoe  signed public filings 

and participated in quarterly investor conference calls that he knew, or was reckless in not knowing, 

contained material misleading statements and omissions about the Company. Defendant signed 

misleading Forms 10-K stating that the Company's revenues were based primarily on contracted rates, 

and that its improved financial and revenue perfonnance was due to legitimate business practices such 

as increased sales to existing and new customers.  Defendant participated in misleading quarterly 

investor conference calls in which Company officials stated that its good perfonnance was due to 

''back-to-basics management discipline," "disciplined business practices," and the experience and 

"discipline" ofthe Company's management team.   In truth, the Company's improved revenues and 

financial perfonnance largely were based on and due to the Company's secret increases to billed line 

counts, in violation ofthe terms ofits customer contracts.
