                                               II. 
 
       The Commission finds that: 
        
       A. RESPONDENT           
 
              1.      Shovers, age 54, is and has been a certified public accountant (“CPA”). He 
was first licensed as a CPA in  Wisconsin in 1980; his license has been expired since 1995. He  
served as Chief Financial Officer of Hayes-Lemmerz International, Inc. (“Hayes”) from 
approximately 1999 until October 2001.  He also was Chief Accounting Officer at least during the 
period of October 2000 through October 2001.  From October 2001 until mid-2003, Shovers 
remained an officer with Hayes Lemmerz.                       
 
   
 B.           CIVIL INJUNCTION       
   
              2.      On December 18, 2008, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of 
Michigan entered a final judgment against Shovers.  The Final Judgment followed a jury trial in 
which the jury found that Shovers had violated the following provisions of the securities laws and 
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder: (1) Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934) (“Exchange Act”) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 [17 C.F.R. § 204.10b-5] thereunder; 
(2) Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933  (the “Securities Act”) [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)(3)]; 
and (3) Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78m(b)(5)], and Rules 13b2-1 [17 
C.F.R. § 240.13b2-1] and 13b2-2 [17 C.F.R. § 240.13b2-2] thereunder.  The jury also found that he  
aided and abetted certain of Hayes’ violations of the federal securities laws.    
                
              3.      The Final Judgment permanently enjoined Shovers from violating Section 
10(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 [17 C.F.R. § 204.10b-5] 
thereunder; Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)(3)]; Section 13(b)(5) of the 
Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78m(b)(5)], and Rules 13b2-1 [17 C.F.R. § 240.13b2-1] and 13b2-2 
[17 C.F.R. § 240.13b2-2] thereunder; and from aiding and abetting violations of Section 13(a), 
Section 13(b)(2)(A), and Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §78m(a), 
§78m(b)(2)(A), and §78m(b)(2)(B)], and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 [17 CFR §240.12b-20, 
17 CFR § 240.13a-1, and 17 CFR § 240.13a-13] thereunder.   The Final Judgment also barred  
Shovers, for a period of five (5) years, from acting as an officer or director of any issuer that has a 
class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78l] or that is 
required to file reports pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78o(d)], and 
ordered him to pay a civil  money penalty of $50,000. 

              4.      The Commission's complaint in this matter alleged that, from fiscal year 
1999 through the first quarter of 2001, senior officers and employees of Hayes engaged in a 
fraudulent scheme to achieve corporate earnings targets and mask declining operating results. 
The complaint alleged that Hayes personnel used several mechanisms to increase income and 
revenue fraudulently, including: (1) inappropriately deferring operating expenses to balance 
sheet accounts, (2) failing to process vendor invoices, (3) understating employee fringe benefits 

                                               2

and (4) improperly recording certain customer discounts to balance sheet accounts.   As a result,  
the complaint alleged, Hayes made materially false filings with the Commission in fiscal years 
1999 and 2000 and for the first quarter of 2001, including the company's annual report on Form  
10-K for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2001, and the quarterly reports on Forms 10-Q for the 
quarterly periods ended April 30, 2000, July 31, 2000, October 31, 2000 and April 30, 2001.  

              5.      The complaint alleged that after Shovers learned about the ongoing 
financial fraud at the company, he made affirmative misrepresentations to the company's outside 
independent auditor about Hayes' financial statements and caused Hayes to make Commission 
filings containing material misrepresentations. The complaint also alleged that Shovers took 
affirmative steps to conceal information about the improper accounting practices from Hayes'  
outside independent auditor and Hayes'  Audit Committee and Board of Directors. 

 
                                                 
                                              III. 
        
       Based upon the foregoing, the Commission finds that a court of competent jurisdiction has  
permanently enjoined Shovers, a CPA, from violating the Federal securities laws within the 
meaning of Rule  102(e)(3)(i)(A) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice.  In view of these findings, 
the Commission deems it appropriate and in the  public interest that Shovers be temporarily 
suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission. 
   
       IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Shovers be, and hereby is, temporarily suspended from 
appearing or practicing before the Commission.  This Order shall be effective upon service on the 
Respondent. 
 
       IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Shovers may within thirty days after service of this 
Order file a petition with the Commission to lift the temporary suspension.  If the Commission 
within thirty days after service of the Order receives no petition, the suspension shall become  
permanent pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(ii). 
  

                                               3

          If a petition is received within thirty days after service of this Order, the Commission shall, 
within thirty days after the filing of the petition, either lift the temporary suspension, or set the 
matter down for hearing at a time and place to be designated by the Commission, or both.  If a 
hearing is ordered, following the hearing, the Commission may lift the suspension, censure the  
petitioner, or disqualify the petitioner from appearing or practicing before the Commission for a 
period of time, or  permanently, pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(iii). 
 
          This Order shall be served upon Shovers personally or by certified mail at his last known 
address. 
           
 By the Commission.
