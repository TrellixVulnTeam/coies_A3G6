                                              II. 

       In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement of Michael J. Nolan (“Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept.  
Solely for the purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of 
the Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the 
findings herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these 
proceedings, and the findings contained in Section III.3 below, which are admitted, Respondent 
consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Rule 102(e) 
of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions 
(“Order”), as set forth below.   

                                              III. 

       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that:  

              1.      Nolan, age 47, was a certified public accountant licensed to practice in the 
State of New Jersey from 1985 until 2005.  He served as Chief Financial Officer of United Rentals, 
Inc. (“URI”) from September 1997 until December 2002, when he was terminated. 

              2.      URI is a Delaware corporation based in Greenwich, Connecticut.  URI is a 
holding company that primarily conducts operations through its wholly owned subsidiary, United 
Rentals (North America), Inc.  URI is one of the largest equipment rental companies in the world 
with a network of rental locations in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.  URI’s common stock 
is registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 (“Exchange Act”) and trades on the New York Stock Exchange.   

              3.      On December 12, 2007, the Commission filed a complaint against Nolan in 
the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut (SEC v. Michael J. Nolan (Civil 
Action No. 03:07-cv-01833-AHN)).  On April 8, 2008, the court entered an order permanently 
enjoining Nolan, by consent, from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, 
Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder, 
and from aiding and abetting future violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of 
the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder. 

              4.      The Commission’s complaint alleged, among other things, that over a two 
 year reporting period from 2000 through 2002, Nolan engaged in a series of fraudulent sale-
 leaseback transactions designed both to recognize revenue prematurely and to inflate profit 
 generated from the sales.  The complaint alleges that as a result of Nolan’s actions, URI 
 materially misstated its financial condition and operating results in filings with the Commission, 
 in offering documents, and in other statements to investors.     

                                               2

                                              IV. 

       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
impose the sanction agreed to in Respondent Nolan’s Offer. 

Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that Nolan is suspended from 
appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant.   

 By       the Commission.
