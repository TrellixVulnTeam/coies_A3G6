      These administrative proceedings were instituted pursuant to Rule 102(e)(1)(iii) of our 
Rules of Practice.1
                   They  center on the alleged willful refusal of respondents, all accounting 
firms located in the People's Republic of China, to provide the Commission with audit work 
papers in violation of their obligations under Section 106 of the Sarbanes -Oxley Act as amended 
by Section 929J of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-
Frank Act).2
             On January 22, 2014, the law judge issued an initial decision.  That decision denied 
the privilege of practicing or appearing before the Commission to four of the five respondents for 
a period of six months.3
                       It censured the remaining respondent, Dahua CPA, Ltd. (Dahua) .4
                                                                                    

      On February 12, 2014, the Division filed a petition for review and sought review of, 
among other things, "that portion of the Initial Decision that would exclude Dahua from a 
practice bar."  On February 21, DLA Piper LLP (DLA) , which had previously entered an 
appearance on behalf of Dahua and defended it in the proceedings before the law judge, filed a 
Notice of Withdrawal of Appearance that purported to be effective February 26.  The notice did

not provide a reason for the purported withdrawal and did not identify substitute counsel.  The 
Division filed an opposition to the notice and moved to strike it.  DLA filed a response stating in 
essence that the scope of its agreed-upon engagement with Dahua was limited to the hearing 
before the law judge only and that it has been discharged as counsel.  Attached to the response is 
a declaration by Zhang Yan, who is described as Dahua's "international liaison," reciting the 
same facts. 

       On March 20, Dahua filed, "[p]ursuant to Rule of Practice 102(d)(2)," a notice of 
appearance "by and through its representative partner Zhang Yan, 11/F B Block Union Square 
5022 Binhe Road Shenzhen, China 518033, telephone no. +86 755 82966044, facsimile no. +86 
755 82900965, email yan_zhang@dahua-cpa.com."  Dahua unqualifiedly represented that it 
would "accept documents in English," "communicate with the Commission in English," and 
"abide by the previously agreed terms of the . . . Stipulated Protective Order" and "all other 
orders concerning confidential treatment of documents." 5
                                                            

                                        DISCUSSION 

       We have determined to deny the Division's motion to strike DLA's notice of withdrawal. 

       A.     The requirements of Rule of Practice 102(d)(4) 

       The Division argues that the Commission should strike the February 21 notice of 
withdrawal under Rule of Practice 102(d)(4) because DLA has not established good cause 
insofar as withdrawal would have an adverse effect on the orderly adjudication of this matter.  
DLA responds that Rule 102(d)(4) does not require withdrawing counsel to offer a reason for 
withdrawal and that Commission action is unnecessary to make its withdrawal effective.    

       In our view, a notice of withdrawal that complies with the technical requirements of Rule 
102(d)(4) generally is self-effectuating; no additional showing of good cause need be made.  
That rule provides, among other things, that "[a]ny person seeking to withdraw his or her 
appearance in a representative capacity shall file a notice of withdrawal with the Commission 
. . . . The notice shall be filed at least five days before the proposed                                                          effective date of the 
withdrawal."6
               We reject  the Division's contention that italiciz ed language   of the rule i.e.  , 
"seeking" and "proposed"implicitly confers upon us the discretion to strike (or otherwise to 
reject) a notice of withdrawal whenever we deem appropriate.  As a countervailing textual 
                                                 
5
       The document management system footer of Da     hua's March 20 notice of appearance has 
some similarities in formatting to that of DLA's February 21 notice of withdrawal  (and filings by 
DLA in other proceedings).  We do not draw any further conclusions, but we note that t he 
nondisclosure of attorney participation in the preparation of a filing might raise serious concerns.  
Among other things, it could permit lawyers to evade the certifications required by Rule 153, 17 
C.F.R. § 201.153.  See, e.g.                  , Duran v. Carris , 238 F.3d 1268, 1273-74 (10th Cir. 2001) (per 
curiam); Ellis v. Maine         , 448 F.2d 1325, 1328 (1st Cir. 1971). 
6
       17 C.F.R. § 201.102(d)(4) (emphasis added).   
---------------------Page 3---------------------

                                               3 
                                                 
matter, the rule's consistent use of the word "notice" (as opposed to "motion") is a strong 
indication that a notice of withdrawal neither seeks nor requires Commission approval.7
                                                                                         
Furthermore, we specifically revised Rule 102(d)(4) in 2004 to remove the prior requirement that 
counsel file a motion to withdraw.  Our commentary accompanying the revisions makes clear 
that the need for Commission action to make withdrawal effective was "eliminate[d]" and that 
"only" notice was required.8
                              For these reasons, we conclude a notice of withdrawal properly 
filed and served in accordance with Rule 102(d)(4) is effective without a showing of good cause. 

       This conclusion does not, however, dispose of the Division's motion to strike.  Standing 
alone, the February 21 notice   was deficient because it did not formally apprise an individual 
authorized to act for Dahua of DLA's intent to withdraw its appearance on Dahua's behalf.  
Nonetheless, as we also shall explain, under the circumstances of this caseand relying on 
Dahua's representations as set forth in its March 20 notice of appearancewe find it unnecessary 
to grant the Division's motion to strike and, accordingly, have determined to deny it. 

       B.     DLA's notice of withdrawal was deficient because it was not properly served 
              on Dahua 

       The February 21 notice of w ithdrawal does not comply with Rule 102(d)(4) because it 
does not reflect that it was served on anyone at Dahua, let alone someone with authority to 
appear for Dahua under Rule 102(b).  Rule 102(d)(4) requires that a notice of withdrawal "be 
served on the parties."9
                         This requirement ensures " timely notice to both the Commission and the 
parties of the withdrawal."10
                              The "parties" include " any person named as a respondent," 
necessarily embracing the respondent for which  counsel entered an appearance. 11
                                                                                   In other 
words, we require that an attorney who wishes to withdraw his or her appearance serve the notice 
of withdrawal on the attorney's own client                               here, Dahua  .   

                                                 
7
       See, e.g., United States v. Harris         , 491 F.3d 440, 444 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (contrasting a 
"notice" with a "motion," which "means '[a]n application made to a court or judge'").

11
       Rule 101(a)(8), 17 C.F.R. § 201.101(a)(8) (emphasis added).  By assumption, counsel 
filing the notice of withdrawal desires to discontinue representing the respondent; in this context, 
it would be an empty gesture if counsel seeking to withdraw merely notified itself .  
---------------------Page 4---------------------

                                                4 
                                                  
       When the respondent is an artificial entity (such as Dahua), it has no physical form and 
can act only through its individual agents.12
                                              A responsible individual at the client must be 
formally apprised that the attorney no longer intends to act in a representative capacity.  
Necessarily, the individual so notified must be someone who is authorized by ou  r Rules of 
Practice to step in and act for the client in the proceeding :  It should be plain that the lawyer 
could not, for example, simply inform a parking lot attendant at the corporation of the 
withdrawal.  Our requirement  runs in tandem with an attorne y's professional responsibilities, 
which require that a withdrawing lawyer provide reasonable notice to the client so that the client 
can look after its own interests.13
                                   A partnership can be represented in our proceeding sand 
therefore can protect its interests in that proceedingonly through an attorney or a "  member."14
                                                                                                   
The February 21 notice did not on its face comply with Rule 102(d)(4)'s service requirement   and 
so was deficient under that rule .15
                                   

       The present situation brings into sharp relief why adherence to this service requirement 
protects the integrity of our administrative proceedings and promotes their just and orderly 
determination.  The Division's petition for review, filed more than a week before the February 21 
notice of withdrawal, explicitly seeks to increase the discipline imposed on Dahua.  It argues that 
the Commission should enter an order barring Dahua from serving as a principal auditor and 
issuing audit opinions and barring Dahua from playing a 50% or greater role in the preparation or 
furnishing of an audit report filed with the Commission.  Additionally, we might on our own 
initiative raise and determine any issues found to be material in the course of our review.16
                                                                                             
Furthermore, portions of the recorde.g., material containing commercially sen   sitive, 
proprietary information or sensitive inter -governmental communications  have been designated 
"OUTSIDE COUNSEL'S EYES ONLY,            " and so cannot, by the terms of the stipulated protective 

                                                 
12
       See, e.g., Daimler AG v. Bauman, 134 S. Ct. 746, 759 n.13 (2014); Bus   . Guides, Inc. v. 
Chromatic Commc    'ns, 498 U.S. 533, 548 (1991). 
13
       E.g., D.C. R. Prof'l Conduct R. 1.16(d) ("In connection with any termination of 
representation, a lawyer shall take timely steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a 
client's interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the client . . . ."); N.Y. Code Prof'l 
Responsibility DR 2-110(A)(2) ("A lawyer shall not withdraw from employment until the lawyer 
has taken steps to the extent reasonably practicable to avoid foreseeable prejudice to the rights of 
the client, including giving due notice to the client . . . ."). 
14
       Rule 102(b), 17 C.F.R. § 201.102(b). 
15
       We note also that the February 21 notice identified the respondent merely as "Dahua 
CPA, Ltd., 12th Floor, 7th Building, No. 16 Xi Si Huan Zhong Road, HaiDan District, Beijing, 
China 100039 (attn.: Gaolei Li, Executive Assistant to Managing Partner, tel. +86 10 5835 0046, 
ligaolei@dahuacpfi.com)."  It is not apparent that Li, whose title is given as an "Executive 
Assistant to Managing Partner," would be  authorized to appear on behalf of Dahua. 
16
       Rule 411(d), 17 C.F.R. § 201.411(d).

order, be reviewed directly by any respondent. 17
                                                  The same would be true of any briefs filed in 
the proceeding that cite or reference such material.  And of course, we expect even unrepresented 
parties to comply with our rules, to file all required papers, and to comply with all orders:  
"Parties, including those appearing pro se                                   , are obligated to familiarize themselves with the Rules 
of Practice."18
                Failure to make a required fil ing may result in the imposition of sanctions, which 
may include the entry of a default, the making of an adverse finding as to particular matters, or 
the determination of the proceeding on the basis of the other side's evidence or briefing.19
                                                                                             

       These circumstances illustrate why we have an interest in being assured that when an 
attorney seeks to withdraw, he or she has properly informed  someone authorized to act for the 
client that the client thereafter must represent itself or obtain substitute counsel.20
                                                                                    Indeed, our 
Rules of Practice anticipate that when an attorney does withdraw, the respondent immediately 
will "keep current" its notice of appearance to designate a new individual authorized to represent 
the entity under Rule 102(b).21
                                 We insist that parties "keep the information contained in the 

                                                 
17
       It is undisputed that the stipulated protective order continues to bind DLA and Dahua.  
The Commission retains jurisdiction to ensure that obligations thereunder are, and will continue 
to be, appropriately discharged.  See                                  Rule 102(e)(1)(ii), 17 C.F.R. § 201.102(e)(1)(ii); D.C. R.

exercise our authority             to require compliance with our rules and to protect the integrity of our 
processes, but we do not thereby assume   the responsibility in every case to superintend the 
relationship between respondents and their attorneys.  See, e.g., Tamenut v. Mukasey                                                                , 521 F.3d

       Although the February 21 notice of withdrawal was by itself deficient, as supplemented 
by Yan's declaration attached to DLA's response and Dahua's March 20 notice of appearance, the 
record now shows that Dahua has been fully apprised of DLA's withdrawal      and has chosen to 
represent itself.  Dahua eventually did a file a notice of appearance by and through a responsible 
"representative partner" with current contact information.  Relying on that factas well as 
accepting Dahua's representations in its March 20 notice we de  ny the Division's motion to 
strike DLA's notice of withdrawal .  We direct that Dahua be served by email as well as by mail 
to ensure that it expeditiously receives orders, decisions, and other papers. 

                                              * * * 

       By separate order, we granted the Division's petition for review of the law judge's initial 
decision; in that order, we also determined, on our own initiative, to review what sanctions, if 
any, are appropriate in this matter.23
                                      Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED, pursuant to Rule 450(a), 
that the Division and Dahua shall file briefs as follows:24
                                                          
                                                      
               Opening brief:  The Division shall file an opening brief, not to 
               exceed 5,000 words, by June   23, 2014.  The brief shall be limited 
               to the scope of remedies imposed on Dahua.    
                
               Response brief:   Dahua shall file a response brief, not to exceed 
               5,000 words, by  August 7, 2014.  The brief shall be limited to 
               responding to the Division's opening brief. 
                
       Because Dahua did not file a petition for review or a cross-petition for review, it is not 
entitled to challenge any of the findings or conclusions made by the law judge.25
                                                                                   As provided by 
Rule 450(a), no briefs in addition to those specified in this schedule may be filed without leave

response brief may result in determination of the proceeding as to Dahua on the basis of only the 
opening brief and the Commission's consideration of the record or such other sanction as the 
Commission finds appropriate under Rule 180    (c).28
