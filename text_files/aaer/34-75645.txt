       The Securities and Exchange Commission deems it appropriate to issue an order of 
forthwith suspension of Dawn M. Schlegel (“Schlegel” or “Respondent”) pursuant to Rule 
                                                                         1

       “Any person whose license to practice as an accountant . .  has been revoked or 
suspended in any State; or any person has been convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor 
involving moral turpitude shall be forthwith suspended from appearing or practicing 
before the Commission. . . .”

District Court  for the  Eastern  District of  New York, finding her  guilty of one count of 
conspiracy to commit securities fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit tax fraud. 
 
       3.      As a result of this conviction, Schlegel was sentenced to time served and 
ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $92,065,727.93. 
 
 
                                            III. 
 
       In view of the foregoing, the Commission finds that Schlegel has been convicted of 
a felony within the meaning of Rule 102(e)(2) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice. 
 
       Accordingly, it is  ORDERED, that  Dawn Schlegel  is forthwith suspended from 
appearing   or   practicing   before   the   Commission   pursuant   to   Rule   102(e)(2)   of   the 
Commission’s Rules of Practice. 
 
       By the Commission.
