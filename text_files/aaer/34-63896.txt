Dale G. Rasmussen, Esq.            :      COMMISSION’S RULES OF PRACTICE 
                                    :   
                                               
                                               
                                             I.  
 
       On April 17, 2006, the Commission, pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(i) of its Rules of 
Practice, suspended attorney Dale G. Rasmussen (“Rasmussen”) from appearing or practicing as 
an attorney before the Commission, with the right to apply to resume appearing and practicing 
after three years.  See Opinion and Order, Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Release No. 53662 
(April 17, 2006).  

       In anticipation of the institution of administrative proceedings pursuant to Rule 
102(e)(3)(i), Rasmussen consented to the entry of a Commission order dated April 17, 2006.  In 
doing so, Rasmussen did not admit or deny the findings set forth in the Order except as to the 
Commission’s jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of the proceedings, and the findings 
contained in Section III of the Order, which he admitted.  The Order provided that Rasmussen 
could apply to resume appearing and practicing before the Commission after a period of three 
years. 

                                             II.  

       On or about July 26, 2010, more than three years after he was suspended, Rasmussen 
filed an application for reinstatement of the privilege to appear and practice before the 
Commission.  His application includes a personal affidavit in which he swore under penalty of 
perjury that he has complied with the Commission’s April 17, 2006 Order, that he is not subject 
to any suspension or disbarment as an attorney by a court of the United States or of any state, 
territory, district, commonwealth, or possession, and that he has not been convicted of a felony 
or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude.  Since the entry of the April 17, 2006 Order, no 
information has come to the attention of the Commission relating to Rasmussen’s character,

integrity, professional conduct or qualifications to practice before the Commission that would be 
a basis for adverse action against him pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s Rules of 
Practice.  In addition, Rasmussen has paid the $1 in disgorgement and the $30,000 civil penalty 
ordered by United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas in the related 
enforcement action.  

                                                          III.  
 
         Based on the foregoing, the Commission has determined that it is appropriate to reinstate 
Rasmussen, pursuant to Rule 102(e)(5), to appear or practice before the Commission.  

 
         Accordingly, it is HEREBY ORDERED that Rasmussen may resume practicing as an 
attorney before the Commission. 

 
         By the Commission.
