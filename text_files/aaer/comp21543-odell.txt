                                      DEFENDANT

       5.     Walden O'Dell, age 64, isa residentofOhio. He was the CEO and Chairman of

Diebold from 1999 to 2005. He  iscurrently retired.

                                   RELATED ENTITY

       6.     Diebold isan Ohio corporation headquartered in North Canton, Ohio. Diebold

manufactures and sells ATMs, bank:security systems, and electronic voting machines. Diebold's

common stock  isregistered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(b) andis

listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

                                          FACTS

       7.     In2003, and other years, Diebold engaged in fraudulent accounting practicesin

order to inflate earnings to meet forecasts. These fraudulent accounting practices included (i)

improper useof "bill and hold" accounting; (ii) manipulating reserves and accruals; (iii)

improperly delaying and capitalizing expenses; (iv) use of cookie jar reserves; and (v) writingup

the valueofused inventory.

       8.     As a resultofthese practices, Diebold filed annual, quarterly, and current reports

with the Commission, and issued press releases, that contained material misstatements and

                                             2

omissions concerning the company's financial performance.   To  correct the recent

misstatements, on September 30, 2008, Diebold restated its financial statements for the years

2003 through 2006, and the first quarterof2007, in its Form 10-K for 2007.

                     Fraudulent Revenue Recognition     --F -Term Orders

       9.      In2003, and other years, Diebold prematurely recognized revenue on many   of the

transactions it called "F-term" orders. Diebold recognized revenue on F-term orders, or Factory

orders, when it shipped products from its factory to a Diebold warehouse. Under generally

accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), normally a product must be shipped to the customer

or services must be rendered before revenue can be recognized.

       10.    With a "bill and hold" transaction, however, revenue can be recognized on the

saleof products prior to delivery to a customerifthe "bill and hold" criteria are met. The criteria

for a bill and hold transaction include: (i) the buyer, not the seller, requests that the transaction

be on a bill and hold basis; (ii) the buyer has a substantial business purpose for ordering on a bill

and hold basis; (iii) thereisa fixed delivery schedule thatisreasonable and consistent with the

buyer's business purpose; (iv) the seller doesnotretain any specific performance obligations

such that the earnings processisincomplete; and (v) the products are ready for shipment.

       11.    Diebold prematurely recognized revenue on certain F-term orders by improperly

using bill and hold accounting. A significant numberof Diebold's F-term orders failed to satisfy

the stringent bill and hold criteria.

       12.    Under GAAP, to use bill and hold accounting, the customer, not Diebold, must

request that the transaction be on a bill and hold basis, and the customer must have a substantial

business purpose for ordering on a bill and hold basis. Manyof Diebold's F-term orders failed to

satisfy these criteria.

                                               3

         Case 1:10-cv-00909-PLF   Document 1     Filed 06/02/10   Page 4 of 10     

       13.     With many F-term orders; Diebold asked customers to sign Diebold's form

contract -- its standard Memorandum  of Agreement ("MOA") -- which contained a boilerplate

clause stating that the customer had requested Diebold to hold items for the customer's

convenience. Diebold then recognized revenue when the company shipped the products from its

factory to its warehouse in accordance with a "ship to warehouse" date contained in the MOA.

Notwithstanding the language in the MOA, Diebold's accounting was not in accordance with

GAAP because generally Diebold's customers had not requested that the transaction be on a bill

and hold basis.

       14.     In addition, certain F-term orders also failed to meet other bill and hold criteria.

For example, to recognize revenue on  a bill and hold basis, there must be a fixed delivery

schedule, the seller must not retain any specific performance obligations such that the earnings

process is incomplete, and the products mustbe complete and ready for shipment.

       15.    Many   ofDiebold's F-term contracts failed to meet these criteria. For instance,

these transactions generally did not have fixed delivery schedules. Moreover, in certain

instances when Diebold recognized revenue on ATMs shipped from its factory to its warehouse,

the ATMs were not complete because software had not yet been installed and/or quality testing

had not yet been performed. In addition,on  certain occasions, Diebold recognized revenue on a

bill and hold basisoncertain products and services for which bill and hold accounting is never

appropriate, including software orders and professional services.

       16.    The bill and hold criteria are well established.Many of the F-term orders failed to

satisfy the criteria for bill and hold accounting. As a resultoffraud and other misconduct,

Diebold prematurely recognized revenue  on those transactions.

         Case 1:10-cv-00909-PLF   Document 1     Filed 06/02/10   Page 5 of 10     

       17.    In 2008, Diebold restated its financial statements for the reporting periods from

2003 through the first quarter of 2007, and announced that going forward it would recognize

revenue upon customer acceptance  of goods or services.In its restatement, Diebold retroactively

applied this new revenue recognition policy which, for 2003, resulted in a decreaseofthe

company's earnings before taxes of $29.5 million. Diebold's premature recognitionofrevenue

on certainF-term orders resulted in revenue and earnings misstatements in eachofDiebold's

quarterly and annual financial statements from 2003 through the first quarterof2007.

                            Manipulating  Reserves  and  Accruals

                                  Under-accrued Liabilities

       18.    Under GAAP, an issuer   isrequiredto accrue for anticipated liabilities.In2003,

and other years, Diebold inflated earnings by failingtoaccrue for known liabilities. For

example, Diebold knew that the liability account for the company's Long Term Incentive Plan

("LTIP") --an employee benefit plan intended to reward long term company performance   --was

under-accrued for much of 2003.

       19.    To accrue for the LTIP in 2003 without negatively impacting earnings, Diebold

offset the liability by improperly reducing other accounts, including an unreconciled accounts

payable account and an unreconciled deferred revenue account. In 2003 alone, Diebold's

manipulation of these accounts had the effectofimproperly under-accruing Diebold's liabilities,

and overstating Diebold's reported pre-tax earnings by at least $16 million.

       20.    From at least 2002 through 2005, asa resultoffraud and other misconduct,

Diebold failed to properly accrue for other liabilities, including its North American sales

commission accrual (commissions to be paid to sales personnel) and its team incentive accrual

(incentive pay to be paid to service personnel).In2005, Diebold restated its financial statements

to correct errors in certain accounts for the years 2002 to 2004 and the first quarterof2005,

                                              5

          Case 1:10-cv-00909-PLF   Document 1     Filed 06/02/10   Page 6 of 10     

including the North American sales commission accrual account. In a letter to the audit

committee, a Diebold officer acknowledged that this account was underaccrued because     "[an

accounting manager] felt that given the need to meet forecast, these [commission accrual]

adjustments should be deferred until a later date."

                                     Manipulating Reserves

        21.    Under GAAP, a liability should  be released upon the occurrence  of a specified

event or when  the estimate should be revised in response to new information.  Moreover,

maintaining general  orexcess reserves (i.e., cookiejarreserves) are expressly prohibited under

GAAP.

       22.     In 2003, and later, Diebold manipulated certain reserves in order to manage

earnings. For example, to meet internal forecasts, a Diebold accounting manager improperly

reduced the Master Purchase Agreement accrual    (aliability account established forpayment  of

customer rebates) to inflate net income in the fourth quarterof2003. There was   no legitimate

accounting basis for this entry. Indeed, this and other improper entries were subsequently

reversed in later quarters.

       23.     Diebold also used cookie jar reserves to manage earnings. For example, in 2003,

Diebold established a $4.5 million corporate obsolescence and excess inventory account. This

corporate inventory account was a cookie  jarreserve thathad  no legitimate accounting basis.

                       Improperly Delaying and Capitalizing Expenses

                                          Division 35

       24.     In 2003, and subsequent years, Diebold failed to recognize certain expenses as

incurred, and instead improperly deferred these expenses or spread the expenses over several

reporting periods, which artificially increased net income in several fiscal years. For example,

Diebold engaged in improper expense deferrals in the "Division 35" account.

                                                6

         Case 1:10-cv-00909-PLF   Document 1     Filed 06/02/10   Page 7 of 10     

       25.    Division 35 was a finished goods inventory account. In 2003, and subsequent

years, Diebold knew the value ofthe account was overstated. Nevertheless, Diebold improperly

failed to reconcile the account until 2005.In2003, the overstatementofthe Division 35 account

inflated Diebold's earningsby $4.3 million.

                                      The Oracle Project

       26.    In 2002, Diebold began a project, which isstill ongoing, to replace manyofits

older internal software systems with Oracle software. Under GAAP, capitalization ofa software

asset requires companies to properly capture internal and external costs involved with the various

stagesof software development. Consequently, Diebold was permitted to capitalize certain costs

associated with the Oracle project. However, in 2003, and subsequent years, Diebold improperly

capitalized information technology costs that should have been expensed in the periods they

were incurred.

       27.    In certain quarters when Diebold's earnings were shortofforecast, Diebold made

top-level entries to fraudulently capitalize additional expenses to the Oracle project. These

improper "additions," which often were round numbers, had the effectof materially reducing

reported expenses, and thus increasing reported earnings. In 2003, Diebold's improper

capitalizationofexpenses to the Oracle project increased Diebold's pre-tax earnings by $.5

million.

                                Used Equipment Write-Ups

       28.    Under GAAP, used equipment inventory should be valued at the lower   of cost or

market. In 2003, and subsequent years, Diebold improperly "wrote-up" the value of certain used

inventory, suchas used ATMs. These "write-ups" had the effect  ofreducing cost of goods sold

and thus inflating earnings. The company used these "write-ups" in order to meet forecasts.

                                              7

         Case 1:10-cv-00909-PLF   Document 1     Filed 06/02/10   Page 8 of 10     

       29.    For example, in the fourth quarter of 2003, Diebold improperly wrote up the value

ofparts contained in some used ATMs by $650,000. Tellingly, these parts were never removed

from the ATMs, and the ATMs were later scrapped.

       30.    These used equipment "write-ups," which were listed on several "opportunity

lists," had no legitimate accounting basis and were used improperlytoinflate Diebold's earnings.

                                Diebold's 2008 Restatement

       31.    As resultofDiebold's improper, and in many instances fraudulent, accounting

practices from at least 2002 to 2007, the financial statements that Diebold incorporated into its

periodic filings and other materials disseminatedtothe investing public were materially false and

misleading. Diebold's improper accounting practices materially inflated the company's reported

pre-tax earnings in 2003, and other years. To correct the more recent misstatements, on

September 30,2008, Diebold restated its financial statements for the years 2003 through 2006,

and the first quarterof2007, in its Form 10-K for 2007.

  O'Dell Received Bonuses and Other Incentive-Based and Equity-Based Compensation

       32.    During the 12-month period following the issuance of Diebold's 2003 Form lO-K

on March 2, 2004, which contained the company's annual financial statements for 2003, O'Dell

received from Diebold $470,016 in cash bonuses, 30,000 sharesofDiebold stock, and stock

options for 85,000 sharesofDiebold stock. These were the last bonuses, stock awards, and stock

options that O'Dell received from Diebold before resigning from the company on December12,

2005.

       33.    O'Dell has never reimbursed Diebold for any portionofthese bonuses, stock

awards, or stock options.

       34.    Paragraphs 1 through33 are realleged and incorporated by reference.

       35.    On March 2, 2004, Diebold issued its 2003 Form lO-K, which contained the
