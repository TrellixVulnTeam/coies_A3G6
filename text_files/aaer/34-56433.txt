ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING 
File No. 3-12794 

IN THE MATTER OF MICHAEL DEUTCHMAN, CPA  

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced the 
issuance of an Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings 
Pursuant to Sections 4C and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 102(e) 
of the Commission’s Rules of Practice (Order) against Michael Deutchman, CPA 
(Deutchman). 

The Order alleges that Deutchman, a certified public accountant, knowingly prepared and 
issued an audit report on the financial statements of a public company in 2004, without 
first registering with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (Board).  Section 
102(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley Act) prohibits accounting 
firms not registered with the Board from preparing or issuing audit reports with respect to 
any issuer after October 22, 2003.  The Order alleges that, by this conduct, Deutchman 
lacked the requisite qualifications to represent others and willfully violated Section 102(a) of 
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. 

Based on the above, the Order institutes cease-and-desist proceedings against Deutchman 
pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), as well as 
proceedings under Sections 4C(a)(1) and 4C(a)(3) of the Exchange Act and Rules 
102(e)(1)(i) and 102(e)(1)(iii) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, to determine whether 
the allegations in the Order are true, whether a cease-and-desist order should be entered 
against Deutchman and whether he should be censured or temporarily or permanently 
denied the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant.   

A hearing will be scheduled before an administrative law judge to determine whether the 
allegations in the Order are true, to provide Deutchman an opportunity to dispute these 
allegations, and to determine what sanctions, if any, are appropriate.  The Order directs the 
Administrative Law Judge to issue an initial decision in this matter no later than 300 days 
from the date of service of the Order.
