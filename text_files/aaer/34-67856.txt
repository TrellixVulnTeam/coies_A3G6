                                                       The Commission, with due regard to the public interest and without preliminary hearing,

Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings 
herein, except as to the Commissions jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these 
proceedings, and the findings contained in Section III.2 below, which are admitted, Respondent 
consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Rule 102(e) 
of the Commissions Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions 
(Order), as set forth below.   
 
                                              III. 
 
       On the basis of this Order and Respondents Offer, the Commission finds that: 
 
               1.     Rooks, age 46, is and has been a certified public accountant licensed to 
practice in the State of Georgia since 1992.   
        
               2.     On September 5, 2012, a final judgment was entered against Rooks , 
permanently enjoining him from future violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Exchange Act 
and Rules 10b-5 and 14e -3 thereunder, in the civil action entitled Securities and Exchange 
Commission v. R. Jeffrey Rooks , Civil Action Number 1:12- CV-2988-CAP, in the United States 
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia.  Rooks was also ordered to pay $18,482.12 in 
disgorgement, $1,432.68 in prejudgment interest, and a $4,620.54 civil money penalty. 
 
               3.     The Commissions complaint alleged, among other things, that Rooks 
traded in the securities of Chattem, Inc., while in possession of material, non-public information 
that had been tipped to him from an accounting partner who misappropriated the information from 
an accounting client, while further knowing that the information was obtained in breach of a duty 
of trust in confidence that the accounting partner owed to the accounting client. 
 
                                              IV. 
                                                 
       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
impose the sanction agreed to in Respondent Rook s Offer. 
 
       Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that Rooks is suspended from 
appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant. 
 
       By the Commission.
