Respondent.                                                                 
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
 
 
                                                    
 
                                              I. 
 
       The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate that public 
administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against Brendan N. 
Connors, CPA (“Respondent” or “Connors”) pursuant to Sections 4C and 21C of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rule 102(e)(1)(iii) of the Commission’s Rules of 
        1
Practice.

abetted the violation of, any provision of the securities laws or the rules and regulations thereunder.   
 
Rule 102(e)(1)(iii) provides, in pertinent part, that: 
The Commission may . . . deny, temporarily or permanently, the privilege of appearing or practicing before it . . . to

                                                  II. 
 
       In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (“Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the purpose of 
these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the Commission, or to 
which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings herein, except as 
to the Commission’s jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these proceedings, which are 
admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Public Administrative and 
Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 4C and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 and Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing 
Remedial Sanctions, a Cease-and-Desist Order, and a Civil Penalty (“Order”), as set forth below.   
                            
                                                 III. 
 
                                                                                    2
       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds  that: 
 
                                              Summary 
                                                    
        1.     This matter involves improper tax accounting practices and material weaknesses in 
internal control over financial reporting at Medifast, Inc. (“Medifast” or “the Company”) from 
2006 through 2008.  During that time, Respondent Brendan Connors was Medifast’s Vice 
President of Finance and head of Medifast’s accounting department.  He was one of the officials 
responsible for ensuring that the Company’s financial statements were presented fairly in 
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), and for devising and 
maintaining a system of internal accounting controls.  
        
       2.        Connors calculated Medifast’s income tax expense during the years 2006 through 
2008 in a manner that did not comply with GAAP.  Connors’ improper conduct resulted in 
Medifast filing periodic reports with the Commission for the years 2006 through 2008 that 
materially understated its tax expense and overstated its net income after tax.  Medifast thus 
violated Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 
                                         3
13a-1 thereunder, and Connors willfully    aided and abetted  and  was a cause of those violations. 
               
                                                   Respondent 
               
       3.      Brendan Connors, age 35, joined Medifast in 2005 as its Vice-President of 
Finance.  He was promoted to Chief Financial Officer in May 2010, and resigned from Medifast in 

                                                 
2
  The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent's Offer of Settlement and are not binding on any other 
person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

  A willful violation of the securities laws means “‘that the person charged with the duty knows what he is doing.’”  
Wonsover v. SEC, 205 F. 3d 408, 414 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (quoting Hughes v. SEC, 174 F. 2d 969, 977 (D.C. Cir. 
1949)).  There is no requirement that the actor “‘also be aware that he is violating one of the Rules or Acts.’”  Id. 
(quoting Gearheart & Otis, Inc. v. SEC, 348 F. 2d 798, 803 (D.C. Cir. 1965)).

 Massachusetts.   He resides in Baltimore County, Maryland.   
           
                                                     Other Relevant Entity  
  
          4.       Medifast, Inc. is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Owings Mills, 
 Maryland.  Through its operating subsidiaries, Medifast manufactures, distributes, and sells weight 
 loss and other health and diet products and supplements.  From 2005 to 2010, Medifast’s revenues 
 grew from $40.1 million to $257.5 million.  Medifast’s common stock is registered with the 
 Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange 
 Act”) and trades on the New York Stock Exchange.   
           
                                                          Facts 
                                                                      
          5.        On March 31, 2010, Medifast filed its Form 10-K for the year ended December 
31, 2009 and restated its financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007, and 
2008 (the “2010 Restatement”).  The 2010 Restatement was required to correct material errors in 
the Company’s reported income tax expense that were the result of Connors’ failure to account for 
Medifast’s income tax provision in conformity with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 
109, Accounting for Income Taxes (“FAS 109”).   
           
                                           The Accounting Standard 
                    
          6.        FAS 109 establishes standards for companies to account for and report the effects 
                   4
of income taxes.       Due to differences between tax laws and accounting standards for financial 
statements,   some events are recognized for financial reporting purposes and for tax purposes in 
different years.  This can give rise to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or 
liabilities and their reported amounts in financial statements.  The diffe          rences are temporary 
because the event will become taxable or deductible when the related asset is recovered or the 
related liability is settled. These temporary differences, or deferred taxes, are accounted for under 
FAS 109 using an asset and liability a       pproach.  A deferred tax asset exists when temporary 
differences will result in deductible amounts in future years.  A deferred tax liability exists when 
temporary differences will result in taxable amounts in future years.  Under FAS 109, a company 
must r ecognize both a current tax liability or asset for the amount of taxes payable or refundable 
for the current year, and a deferred tax liability or asset for the estimated future tax effects 
attributable to temporary differences.        
  
           Connors’ Improper Accounting and Failure to Maintain Effective Internal Control 
           
          7.       As head of Medifast’s accounting department, Connors was responsible for 
selecting, applying, and implementing appropriate accounting policies to ensure that the 
Company’s reported financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP.  He was also

   Upon the codification of GAAP, which became effective for periods ending after September 15, 2009, FAS 109 
 became part of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740, Income Taxes.

one of the officials responsible for preparing the Company’s financial statements and for devising 
and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls.   
          
         8.     For the years 2006 through 2008, Connors calculated the Company’s year-end 
income tax provision using a pre-existing spreadsheet that included entries for the calculation of 
deferred taxes and current taxes (“Tax Spreadsheet”).  He used the Tax Spreadsheet to obtain the 
Company’s income tax provision for reporting in the Company’s financial statements.  Connors, 
however, lacked the appropriate accounting expertise and knowledge to calculate the Company’s 
tax provision in accordance with GAAP.  He failed to properly account for the Company’s 
deferred taxes, including failing to correctly record the deferred tax liability resulting from the 
depreciation of certain fixed assets for tax purposes faster than for financial statement purposes.  
He also failed to ensure that the Company had adequate in-house accounting personnel with the 
knowledge to prepare the Company’s income tax provision in accordance with GAAP. 
          
         9.     In addition, Connors’ tax calculations as entered on the Tax Spreadsheets differed 
materially from the current and deferred income tax provisions that were reported in Medifast’s 
Form 10-K filings.  On the Tax Spreadsheet for 2007, for example, Connors calculated the 
Company’s current tax provision as $1,805,708 and a total deferred tax asset of $1,079,321.  In 
contrast to those numbers, however, Medifast’s Form 10-K for 2007 reported the current income 
tax provision as $1,233,000 and a deferred tax expense of $473,000.  On Medifast’s Tax 
Spreadsheet for 2008, Connors calculated a current income tax provision of $2,578,107 and a total 
deferred tax asset of $1,321,072, but Medifast’s Form 10-K for 2008 reported the current income 
tax provision as $1,711,000 and a deferred tax expense of $704,000.   
 
         10.    In fact, both the reported figures for Medifast’s income tax provision in its 2007 
and 2008 Forms 10-K and the tax provision calculations prepared by Connors on the Company’s 
Tax Spreadsheets for those years were wrong, and Medifast’s income tax expense increased 
significantly as reported in its 2010 Restatement.  Connors, who was responsible for preparing the 
tax disclosure in the Company’s reported financial statements, included materially different 
numbers for the Company’s tax provision in its 2007 and 2008 Form 10-Ks than the numbers he 
had calculated on the Tax Spreadsheets for those years.  Connors also failed to ensure that the 
Company’s prior-year income tax returns reconciled with its reported income tax provisions.   
          
          
                                       The 2010 Restatement 
          
         11.    Because of Connors’ improper tax accounting and failure to maintain adequate  
internal accounting controls, Medifast materially overstated its net income after tax for 2006, 2007, 
and 2008 by an average of 12.4% per year:

                 Restatement: 
          
          
         12.    In its 2010 Restatement, Medifast acknowledged that it had a material weakness in 
 its internal controls over financial reporting because the preparation and review process for the 
 calculation of its tax provision was inadequate, which led to errors in the computation of  its 
 deferred tax assets, deferred tax liabilities, and the income tax provision.  Medifast’s audit firm 
 also expressed an adverse opinion in its report on the Company’s internal control over financial 
 reporting as of December 31, 2009, due to the material weakness in Medifast’s accounting for 
 income taxes. 
                         
         13.    Subsequently, in connection with the audit of Medifast’s 2010 internal control 
over financial reporting, the Company’s auditor found that Medifast had a material weakness in its 
internal control over income tax accounting, including a failure to reconcile its prior-year tax 
returns with its reported prior-year tax provisions. 
          
                                       Violations 
                   
         14.    Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act requires issuers that have securities registered 
 pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act to file such periodic and other reports as the 
 Commission may prescribe and in conformity with such rules as the Commission may 
 promulgate.  Exchange Act Rule 13a-1 requires issuers to file annual reports with the 
 Commission.  In addition to the information expressly required to be included in such reports, 
 Rule 12b-20 under the Exchange Act requires issuers to add such further material information, if 
 any, as may be necessary to make the required statements, in light of the circumstances under 
 which they are made, not misleading.  “The reporting provisions of the Exchange Act are clear 
 and unequivocal, and they are satisfied only by the filing of complete, accurate, and timely 
 reports.”  SEC v. Savoy Industries, 587 F. 2d 1149, 1165 (D.C. Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 
 913 (1979).  A violation of the reporting provisions is established if a report is shown to contain 
 materially false or misleading information.  SEC v. Kalvex, Inc., 425 F. Supp. 310, 316 
 (S.D.N.Y. 1975).  As described above, Connors was responsible for preparing Medifast’s 
 financial statements for the years 2006 through 2008 and caused Medifast to issue annual reports 
 on Form 10-K for those years which materially misrepresented the Company’s financial results.  
 Accordingly, Connors aided and abetted and was a cause of Medifast’s violations of Section 
 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 12b-20 thereunder.   

                                                 5  
---------------------Page 6---------------------

 
       15.     Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 require issuers to make 
and keep books, records, and accounts that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and 
dispositions of their assets, and prohibit any person from directly or indirectly causing to be 
falsified any book, record, or account subject to Section 13(b)(2)(A).  Scienter is not required to 
                                                                                               th
establish a violation of Rule 13b2-1.  See, e.g., SEC v. Das, et al., No. 12-2780, slip op. at 17 (8  
Cir. July 29, 2013); SEC v. Softpoint, 958 F. Supp. 846, 865-66 (S.D.N.Y. 1997), aff’d, 159 F. 3d 
1348 (2d Cir.1998).  Instead, violations of this rule may be established by showing negligent 
conduct.  As described above, Connors was responsible for the Company’s improper accounting 
regarding its tax provision from 2006 through 2008 and caused Medifast’s improper recording of 
its tax provision in its books and records.  Accordingly, Connors violated Rule 13b2-1 and aided 
and abetted and was a cause of Medifast’s violations of Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act.   
        
       16.     Section 13(b)(2)(B) requires issuers to devise and maintain a system of internal 
accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as 
necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP.  As 
discussed above, Connors failed to devise and maintain adequate internal accounting controls with 
regard to the Company’s income tax accounting.  As a result, Connors aided and abetted and was a 
cause of Medifast’s violations of Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act.  
 
                                             Findings 
 
 
       17.     Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that Connors violated Rule 13b2-1 
of the Exchange Act and willfully aided and abetted and was a cause of Medifast’s violations of 
Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 
thereunder.  
 
                                               IV. 
                                                  
       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in Respondent Connors’ Offer. 
 
       Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that: 
 
       A.      Connors shall cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any 
future violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 
12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-1 thereunder.   
 
       B.      Connors is denied the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission 
as an accountant.   
 
       C.      After one year from the date of this order, Connors may request that the 
Commission consider his reinstatement by submitting an application (attention: Office of the 
Chief Accountant) to resume appearing or practicing before the Commission as: 
      
                                                 6

               1.     a preparer or reviewer, or a person responsible for the preparation or 
review, of any public company’s financial statements that are filed with the Commission.  Such 
an application must satisfy the Commission that Connors’ work in his practice before the 
Commission will be reviewed either by the independent audit committee of the public company 
for which he works or in some other acceptable manner, as long as he practices before the 
Commission in this capacity; and/or 
      
               2.     an independent accountant.  Such an application must satisfy the 
Commission that: 
      
                      (a)     Connors, or the public accounting firm with which he is associated, 
is registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) in accordance 
with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and such registration continues to be effective; 
 
                      (b)     Connors, or the registered public accounting firm with which 
he/she is associated, has been inspected by the PCAOB and that inspection did not identify any 
criticisms of or potential defects in the respondent’s or the firm’s quality control system that 
would indicate that the respondent will not receive appropriate supervision; 

                      (c)     Connors has resolved all disciplinary issues with the PCAOB, and 
has complied with all terms and conditions of any sanctions imposed by the PCAOB (other than 
reinstatement by the Commission); and 
 
                      (d)     Connors acknowledges his responsibility, as long as he appears or 
practices before the Commission as an independent accountant, to comply with all requirements 
of the Commission and the PCAOB, including, but not limited to, all requirements relating to 
registration, inspections, concurring partner reviews and quality control standards.   
 
       D.      The Commission will consider an application by Connors to resume appearing or 
practicing before the Commission provided that his state CPA license is current and he has 
resolved all other disciplinary issues with the applicable state boards of accountancy.  However, 
if state licensure is dependent on reinstatement by the Commission, the Commission will 
consider an application on its other merits.  The Commission’s review may include consideration 
of, in addition to the matters referenced above, any other matters relating to Connors’ character, 
integrity, professional conduct, or qualifications to appear or practice before the Commission. 
        
       E.      Connors shall, within 180 days of the entry of this Order, pay a civil money penalty 
in the amount of $40,000 to the United States Treasury.  If timely payment is not made, additional 
interest shall accrue pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3717.  Payment must be made in one of the following 
ways:   
 
       (1) Respondent may transmit payment electronically to the Commission, which will 
           provide detailed ACH transfer/Fedwire instructions upon request; 
         
       (2) Respondent may make direct payment from a bank account via Pay.gov through the 
           SEC website at http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ofm.htm; or  
                                                7
