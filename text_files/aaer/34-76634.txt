                                           II.

                                               III. 
 
                                                                                1
       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds  that: 
 
                                            Summary 
  
       1.      Respondent, a former employee of Diebold, Inc. (“Diebold”), entered into a 
cooperation agreement with the Division of Enforcement on April 19, 2010, in connection with the 
Commission’s investigation of violations of the federal securities laws at Diebold, and related 
enforcement proceedings.  That investigation and related enforcement proceedings against the 
company and certain of its former senior executives are now concluded.  The Commission, having 
taken into consideration Respondent’s substantial cooperation, enters this Order resolving the matter 
with respect to Respondent. 
 
       2.      As described below, Respondent, often at the direction of management, made 
improper accounting entries in Diebold’s books, records, and accounts in 2003 and 2004 while he 
was Vice President of Global Finance at the company.  As a result of the conduct described herein, 
Respondent caused violations of Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 
“Exchange Act”), and violated Rule 13b2-1 thereunder. 
     
                                            Respondent 
 
       3.       Michael McKenna, 53, is a resident of New Hartford, New York.  McKenna was 
the Vice President of Global Finance at Diebold from 2002 to 2005, and the company’s Vice

from Diebold.  Since January 2010, McKenna has been the Finance Director and Controller of a 
private company in Utica, New York.  McKenna is a certified public accountant in Ohio.  His 
license is inactive.  McKenna entered into a cooperation agreement with the Division of 
Enforcement on April 19, 2010.

                                          Background 
 
       10.     McKenna is a former employee of Diebold, Inc., a public company based in North 
Canton, Ohio that manufactures and sells ATMs and bank security systems.  McKenna was the 
Vice President of Global Finance at Diebold from 2002 to 2005, and the company’s Vice President 
of North American Finance from 2005 through 2007.  In 2003 and 2004, McKenna, often at the 
direction of senior management, made improper accounting entries in Diebold’s books, records, 
and accounts.  These improper entries assisted the company and its management in artificially 
inflating Diebold’s reported earnings to meet forecasts.       
                                                 
       11.     Under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), normally a product 
must be shipped to the customer or services rendered before revenue can be recognized.  An 
exception exists, however, for what are known as “bill and hold” transactions.  With a “bill and 
hold” transaction, revenue can be recognized on the sale of products prior to delivery to the 
customer if the GAAP criteria for a bill and hold transaction are met.   
 
       12.     From at least 2002 through 2007, Diebold improperly used “bill and hold” 
accounting to recognize revenue on certain transactions it called “F-term” (or “Factory”) orders.  
Diebold recognized revenue on these orders when it shipped products from its factory to a Diebold 
warehouse.  During his tenure at Diebold, McKenna had accounting responsibilities for F-term 
orders.  At the direction of management, McKenna and his subordinates recorded revenue on F-
term orders when the company shipped products from its factory to a Diebold warehouse.  Many 

                                                3  
---------------------Page 4---------------------

of these F-term orders, however, did not satisfy the GAAP criteria for bill and hold accounting.  By 
improperly applying bill and hold accounting to certain F-term orders, the company prematurely 
recognized revenue on many of these transactions.      
 
       13.     In 2004, at the direction of management, McKenna directed Diebold employees to 
ship certain F-term orders from factory to warehouse prior to the shipment dates agreed to with 
customers.  This practice was known at the company as “pulling in” F-term orders.  The amount of 
F-term orders “pulled in” varied by quarter, but in many instances was done purposely to inflate 
earnings in order to meet forecasts.  For example, at the end of the second quarter of 2004, the 
company “pulled in” approximately $3.4 million in orders that were not scheduled to ship until the 
following quarter, and in the fourth quarter of 2004 the company “pulled in” approximately $3.8 
million in orders that were not scheduled to ship until the following year.  This improper practice 
inflated Diebold’s earnings in those quarters by approximately $1.1 million and $1.3 million, 
respectively.  
 
       14.     As a result of changes in the company’s revenue recognition practices in 2004, 
fewer orders were being designated as F-term orders, and thus less revenue was being recognized.  
As a result, by the third-quarter of 2004, the company was not on track to meet earnings forecasts.  
At the direction of senior management to close the gap, McKenna made an $18.8 million top-level 
journal entry that pulled in revenue that would not have been recognized until subsequent quarters 
under its new practices.  As a result of this improper entry, Diebold met its revised earnings 
forecast in the third quarter of 2004.   
 
       15.     As a result of the conduct described above, McKenna caused Diebold’s violations 
of Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act, which requires Commission registrants to make and 
keep books, records, and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the registrant. 
        
       16.     As a result of the conduct described above, McKenna violated Rule 13b2-1 of the 
Exchange Act, which states that no person shall, directly or indirectly, falsify or cause to be 
falsified, any book, record or account subject to section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act. 
 
                                           Cooperation 
        
       17.     McKenna entered into a cooperation agreement with the Division of Enforcement on 
April 19, 2010, in connection with the Commission’s investigation of violations of the federal 
securities laws at Diebold and related enforcement proceedings.  As a result of the investigation, the 
Commission filed the following enforcement actions, all of which are now concluded:   
 
       18.     On June 2, 2010, the Commission filed a settled enforcement action against 
Diebold in which it consented to a final judgment ordering injunctive relief and a $25 million civil 
penalty.  See SEC v. Diebold, Inc., Civ. Action No. 1:10-CV-00908 (D.D.C.) / Lit. Rel. No. 21543. 
 
       19.     On June 2, 2010, the Commission filed a settled compensation claw-back action 
against Walden O’Dell, Diebold’s former CEO and Chairman, pursuant to Section 304 of the 

                                                 4

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, in which he consented to a final judgment ordering him to reimburse 
$470,016 in cash bonuses, 30,000 shares of Diebold stock, and stock options for 85,000 shares of 
Diebold stock.  See SEC. v. O’Dell, Civ. Action No. 1:10-CV-00909 (D.D.C.) / Lit. Rel. No. 
21543. 
 
       20.     On June 2, 2010, the Commission filed a contested enforcement action against 
Gregory Geswein, Diebold’s former CFO.  On May 26, 2015, pursuant to a settlement, the court 
entered a final consent decree against Geswein ordering him to pay $680,000 in disgorgement, a 
$170,000 civil penalty, and prohibiting him for three years from acting as an officer or director of a 
public company.  See SEC v. Geswein, et al., Civ. Action No. 5:10-CV-01235 (N.D. Ohio) / Lit. 
Rel. Nos. 21543 and 23268. 
 
       21.     On June 2, 2010, the Commission filed a contested enforcement action against 
Kevin Krakora, Diebold’s former Controller and later CFO.  On May 26, 2015, pursuant to a 
settlement, the court entered a final consent decree against Krakora ordering him to pay $400,000 in 
disgorgement, a $100,000 civil penalty, prohibiting him for three years from acting as an officer or 
director of a public company, and prohibiting him from appearing or practicing before the 
Commission as an accountant, with a right to apply for reinstatement after three years.  See SEC v. 
Geswein, et al., Civ. Action No. 5:10-CV-01235 (N.D. Ohio) / Lit. Rel. Nos. 21543 and 23268.  
 
       22.     On June 2, 2010, the Commission filed a contested enforcement action against 
Sandra Miller, Diebold’s former Director of Corporate Accounting.  On May 26, 2015, pursuant to 
a settlement, the court entered a final consent decree against Miller that permanently enjoins her 
from aiding and abetting any violation of Section 13(a), Section 13(b)(2)(A), and Section 
13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, and 12b-20 thereunder, and 
ordered disgorgement of $29,057, which was waived, and no penalty imposed, based on her 
financial condition.  See SEC v. Geswein, et al., Civ. Action No. 5:10-CV-01235 (N.D. Ohio) / Lit. 
Rel. Nos. 21543 and 23268. 
 
       23.     McKenna provided significant cooperation in connection with the Commission’s 
investigation of this matter and its related enforcement actions.   
                                                  
                                               IV. 
 
       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in Respondent McKenna’s Offer. 
        
       Accordingly, pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, it is hereby ORDERED that:

       B.      Respondent shall pay disgorgement of $42,700 to the Securities and Exchange
