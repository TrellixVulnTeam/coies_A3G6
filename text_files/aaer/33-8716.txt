                                                III. 
                                            FINDINGS 
 
              The Commission makes the following findings:2
 
       A.     RESPONDENTS 
        
       Vedco, a privately owned veterinary buying gr  oup based in St. Joseph, Missouri, with 
approximately $114 million in annual sales, accounted for 18% and 12% of Virbac Corporations 
(Virbac or the Company) net revenues in 2002 and 2001, respectively.   3

 Campbell      , age 52, is the general manager of Vedco and is Virbacs principal Vedco 
contact. 
 
       B. RELATED PARTIES               
 
       Virbac, a Delaware corporation headquartered in  Fort Worth, Texas, is  the result of the 
March 1999 acquisition of Agri-Nutrition Group Limited (AGNU), a publicly held company, by 
Virbac Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Virb       ac S.A., a French vete  rinary pharmaceutical 
manufacturer.  Virbacs common stock is registered with the Commission under Section 12(g) of 
the Exchange Act and trades in the Pink Sheets under     the symbol VBAC      since it was delisted 
from the NASDAQ National Market  on January 23, 2004  for Virbacs failure to  file timely its 
periodic reports. 
 
       Thomas L. Bell, age 45, served as president and CEO of Virbac from April 1999, as well as 
a director from May 2002, until he resigned effective January 27, 2004. 

       Joseph A. Rougraff, age 46, and a CPA licensed in the state of Indiana, served as vice 
president, CFO, and corporate  secretary of Virbac fr om May 2000 until he resigned effective 
January 27, 2004. 

 Douglas A. Hubert                    , age 38, joined Virbac in March 1991 as a sales territory manager and 
served as vice president of the Veterinary Division from April 2000 until his resignation in January 
2005. 
        
        
       C. FACTS         
 
                                                                                                                                                             
2
                The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondents Offer and are not binding on any other person or entity 
in these or any other proceedings. 
 
3
       During the relevant time period, Vedco was owned by ni ne veterinary supply companies that use Vedco to 
achieve economies of scale when purchasing products.

---------------------Page 3---------------------

               1. Background     

       Shortly after the March 1999      merger of Virbac, Inc. with AGNU, Bell was named 
Virbacs CEO.  Primarily through the introduction of new products, Virbacs revenues grew from 
$44 million in 1999 to $64 million in 2002.  From January 2000 through September 2002, Bell, in 
press releases and conference calls, consistently  expressed confidence that the Company would 
achieve its strategic goal of more than doubling revenues to $100 million by 2004.  Together with 
Rougraff, Bell touted positive ear  nings results in press releases  , investor presentations, and 
conference calls which they attributed primarily     to successful product launches.  Virbacs 
Veterinary Division, the larges   t of its three repo    rtable segments, which accounted for 
approximately 50% of Virbacs co nsolidated revenue, was portrayed  as the principal driver of 
the Companys growth and success. 
 
       Virbacs stock price rose in response to the Companys favorable operating results and Bell 
and Rougraffs upbeat statementsfrom $1.1 25 on March 5, 1999 to $8  .35 on November 12, 
2003. The November 12 price peak immediately   preceded Virbacs announcement of delay in 
filing its third quarter 2003 Form   10-Q.  Within two weeks of       this announcement, Virbac 
confirmed it would be restating its financial statements. Virbacs stock price tumbledfrom $8.35 
per share on November 12, 2003, when Virbac disclosed delays in filing its Form 10-Q, to $2.70 
on February 20, 2004, when Virbac disclosed the Commissions investigation. 
 
               2.           Elements of the Scheme 
        
       To foster the illusion of rapid revenue and ea rnings growth, Virbac orchestrated a multi-
pronged scheme to manipulate Virbacs financial statements.  The scheme involved, among other 
things: 1) accelerating revenue  recognition on shipments  of product that exceeded distributors 
current demands (i.e., Virbacs loading cycle); 2) recognizing revenue on sham transactions; 3) 
failing to cut off sales at fiscal period-end; and 4) deferring expenses, principally by manipulating 
reserves and accruals. 
 
              Bell and Hubert were able to convince Vedco to assist in the scheme.4
                                                                                 Virbac was one of 
Vedcos top five suppliers.  In order to mainta  in that relationship, Campbell consented to the 
transactions requested by Bell and Hubert.  Vedco did not derive any direct benefit from its 
participation in the scheme. 
 

                                                                                                                                                             
4
                Vedco accounted for 60% of the invoices that Virbac used to inflate its revenue.

               3.         Vedco and Campbells Participat  ion in the Revenue Inflation and 
                       Expense Deferral Scheme 
        
                       a.           Virbacs Loading Strategy 
 
       In early 1999, Virbac began a loading strategy with its distributors to meet Bells sales and 
income targets and to fulfill its mission statement: double-digit earnings growth through successful 
product launches.  Virbac relied heavily upon Vedco and another distributor to execute its loading 
strategy, granting whatever concessions were necessary to make sales in excess of distributors 
current requirements.  In some instances, Virbac offered very long payment termsoften 180 
days or more instead of a more typical 30 daysor even consignment terms to Vedco.  On other 
occasions, various volume discounts and rebates were  given to induce large purchases.  In many 
cases, Virbac promised Vedco that it could simp      ly return large quantities of product for full 
credit, or exchange it for replac ement product, at a later date.   These return or exchange terms 
were rarely reflected in Vedcos purchase or        ders to Virbac.  Through these distributor 
enticements, Virbac improperly recorded revenue in violation of Generally Accepted Accounting 
Principles (GAAP).  5
        
       Virbacs most excessive loading strategy involved new product launches, such as Preventic 
Plus (flea and tick collar), Iverhart Plus (heartworm medication), and its generic ivermectin pour-
on products (cattle de-wormers).  Additionally, Virbac used product launches to accelerate revenue 
through a scheme in which Vedco was asked to purchase an existing product with the understanding 
it could be exchanged for a newly launched product when available. For example, Virbac pushed 
Preventic in the fourth quarter  of 2000 in advance of the Preventic Plus launch, and pushed 
Preventic Plus and other products in the second and third quarters of 2001 in advance of the Iverhart 
Plus launch.  In none of these  instances did Vedcos purchase orders reflect the true nature of the 
transactions. 
        
       After initial Preventic  Plus sales lagged behind its       projections, Virbac created the 
appearance of a successful product launch by pushi ng Preventic Plus to Vedco to meet Virbacs 
second and third quarter 2001 sales and earnings ta  rgets.  For example,  Hubert requested that 
Campbell issue a Vedco purchase order for half of  his first order of Iverha rt Plus in Preventic 
Plus, with the inducement that the product could be kept on a trailer until needed.  Contrary to 
their previous practices, Campbell acceded to Huberts request for the purchase order and caused 
Vedco to issue a $351,000 purchas  e order for Preventic Plus after Hubert granted unusually 
extended payment terms of 150 days, versus the normal 30 days.  Virbac paid for 102 days of 
storage fees until Campbell, at Huberts insistence, finally accepted delivery of the collars.  Contrary 
to FAS 48, Virbac recognized revenue, without regard to expected returns, when it invoiced Vedco 
on September 29, 2001. 
        

                                                                                                                                                             
5
               GAAP requires the following criteria  for revenue recognition: 1) persuasive evidence that an arrangement 
exists; 2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; 3) the seller's price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; 
and 4) collectibility is reasonably assured.  See, e.g., Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 48 (FAS 48); 
Statements of Financial Accounting Concepts Nos. 2 a nd 5 (SFAC 2 and SFAC 5); and Accounting Research 
Bulletin No. 43 (ARB 43).

---------------------Page 5---------------------

       When the Vedco $351,000 invoice became due on February 26, 2002, Rougraff and Bell 
were aware of, or approved, one  or more due date extensions, totaling more than a year, through 
February 28, 2003, in lieu of requiring payment.  Vedco viewed this shipment as a consignment, 
and ultimately paid only $41,000 for collars it actually sold.  The balance of the shipment expired in 
Vedcos warehouse, and Virbac was forced to issue Vedco a $308,000 credit in the fourth quarter of 
2003.  Virbac should not have included the $351,000 in revenue for the third quarter of 2001, 
because payment was contingent upon resale by Vedco and because it was probable th  at the collars 
would be returned or replaced after they expired.  See FAS 48.  This transaction resulted in a 3% 
overstatement of actual third quarter 2001 revenues. 
        
       In early 2001, Virbac heralded Iverhart Pl   us as a high-growth opportunity.  Due to 
regulatory delays, however, Virbac did not have the necessary approvals to ship Iverhart Plus until 
the fourth quarter of 2001.  Approximately $600,000 of Iverhart Plus was shipped to Vedco in the 
fourth quarter of 2001 with the explicit agreement, approved by Bell and documented in an e-mail 
between Hubert and Campbell, that any unsold product could be returned in 90 days for full credit. 
        
       In an effort to meet Virbacs revenue and earnings targets, Hubert convinced Campbell at 
the end of the first quarter of 2002 to issue a purchase order for $1.6 million of Iverhart Plusall of 
Virbacs available inventory.  Hubert reiterated  to Campbell, with Bells concurrence, that any 
expired product would be replaced at no cost to Vedco.  Although payment terms were stated as 90 
days on the invoice, Vedco had no obligation to pay unless, and until, it sold the product. 
        
       Because Virbac shipped all remaining Iverhart Plus inventory to Vedco, it had no available 
inventory to fill other customers orders at the beginning of the second quarter of 2002.  To remedy 
this problem, Hubert, Bell, and Rougraff decided, with the assistance of Campbell, to ship product 
from Vedco to other Virbac customers.  As a result, Virbac improperly recognized revenue from a 
second shipment of the same productfrom Vedco to another distributorand sidestepped reversal 
of the first sale to Vedco by shipping replacement product at no cost to Vedco.  Campbell and 
Hubert had agreed to this unusual arrangement during the first quarter of 2002.  Hubert informed 
Campbell that he did not want to issue a credit   for the Iverhart Plus because it might present a 
problem with Virbacs auditors.   Although Vedco made some payments on Iverhart Plus sales 
throughout 2002, Virbac was forced to issue $857,000 of credits to Vedco in the fourth quarter of 
2003 for the remainder of this product, which had expired.  Virbac further inflated reported earnings 
by not recording a reserve for anticipated returns of Iverhart Plus. 
        
       In its May 2, 2002 earnings release, Virbac announced record revenue and operating income 
results for the first quarter of 2002.  In the release, Bell stated that the Veterinary Divisions sales 
jumped 72% year-over-year, marked by early impressive sales for newcomers Iverhart Plus and 
Preventic Plus.  Virbacs rest ated revenues included a $1.6 million adjust ment (due to an 11% 
overstatement of actual first quarter 2002 sales) to reduce first quarter 2002 Iverhart Plus revenues. 
        
       At the end of the second quarter of 2002, Campbell again agreed to issue a Vedco purchase 
order for $598,000 of Iverhart Plus, even though Vedco had not sold $1.4 million of the $1.6 million 
of Iverhart Plus it acquired in the prior quarter.  Again, Campbell viewed Vedcos obligation to pay 
as contingent upon resale, despite Vedcos issuance of a purchase order reflecting fixed payment

terms.  Vedco was unable to sell any of the product.  Virbac recorded a mere $64,000 reserve for 
returns of Iverhart Plus at the end of the seco nd quarter of 2002; however, Virbacs management 
knew that anticipated returns would be higher as a result of    the high percentage of inventory at 
Vedco that would become unmarketable within 90 days and require replacement due to expiration 
dates.  Vedco ultimately made no payments on the second quarter 2002 shipment and Virbac was 
forced to issue a credit to Vedco for the entire  $598,000 invoice amount in the fourth quarter of 
2003. 
        
                             b.          Fraudulent Bill-and-Hold Sale 
        
       Virbac improperly recognized $775,000 of revenue related to the pour-on invoiced to Vedco 
on December 28, 2001.  The transactions were documented as valid bill-and-hold sales.    6
                                                                                            The sales, 
however, did not comply with th e bill-and-hold criteria spelled out in GAAP for two reasons: 1) 
Virbac, rather than Vedco, initiate d the transactions and 2) they     lacked fixed delivery dates.  
Virbacs auditors were misled into believing that all b ill-and-hold criteria had been met as of the 
date of the transaction.  When   Virbacs auditors requested thir d-party confirmation, Campbell 
approved a subordinates signing and returning the confirmation, even though Campbell knew, or 
should have known, that some of the representations were false. 
        
                                   c.           Vedco Assisted Virbac in Manipulating Reserves and Accruals 
        
       In addition to overstating revenues, Virbac  s management also manipulated expenses 
such as reserves, accruals, and sales credits, a nd their associated books and records, to maintain 
the illusion that Virbac was meeting internal a    nd external sales and earnings forecasts.  For 
example, although Virbac emphasized to its distribu tors that expired product could be returned 
for full credit or replacement product, Virbac re    sisted issuing credits in order to lessen the 
negative impact on its reported earnings.  Inst      ead, it promised, but often failed, to ship 
replacement product.  The full exte nt of expiring or expired product, especially Iverhart Plus, 
was concealed in schedules provided by Virbac to  its auditors for testing the reasonableness of 
its accruals. 
        
       For example, Vedco and Campbell participated in Iverhart Plus reserve manipulation during 
the fourth quarter of 2002.  To avoid increasing Virbacs accrual, Hubert, with the knowledge and 
consent of Campbell, caused Virbac to invoice Vedco for $258,000      of product previously shipped 
to Vedco at no cost as replacement for expired product.  Hubert explained to Campbell in January 
2003 that he needed this favor to help Virbac   avoid increasing its Iverhart Plus replacement 
reserve.  Vedco paid the invoice, but was issued a credit for the full amount by Virbac.  As a result 
of this subterfuge, Virbac achieved two positive outcomes.  First, Virbac was able to disguise as 
revenue from a new sale what sh ould have been recognized as an expense.  More significantly, 
however, Virbac was able to mask the true percentage of expired product, which in turn understated

               SFAC 5 states that revenue should not be recognized until the seller has substantially accomplished what it 
must do pursuant to the terms of the agreement, which usually occurs upon delivery.  A bill-and-hold sale is an exception 
in that revenue is recognized prior to delivery.  See also, SAB 101 which lists specific criteria for bill-and-hold sales.
