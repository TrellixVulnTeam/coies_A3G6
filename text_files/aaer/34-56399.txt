2003 fiscal year ended September 30, 2003.  

B.     FACTS 

       1.     The Flamemaster Corporation (“Flamemaster”) is a corporation with its 
headquarters in Sun Valley, California.  Flamemaster’s common stock traded on the pink sheets 
and was registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act until 
May 26, 2005, when the company filed a Form 15 with the Commission to terminate the 
registration of its stock.  For its fiscal year ended September 30, 2003, Flamemaster reported 
revenues of $5.1 million and total assets of $7.4 million.   

       2.     Flamemaster has at all relevant times been an issuer as defined by the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Act”). 

       3.     The Firm audited Flamemaster’s 2003 financial statements included in 
Flamemaster’s annual report for fiscal year 2003 on Form 10-KSB, filed with the Commission 
on December 19, 2003.  As part of that audit, the Firm prepared and issued an audit report dated 
December 8, 2003 (the “Flamemaster audit report”), which the company included in its 2003 
Form 10-KSB.  Flamemaster paid the Firm $25,800 for the audit work.   4 

       4.     At the time the Firm issued the Flamemaster audit report, it was not registered 
with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the “Board”), as required by Section 
102(a) of the Act. 

       5.     Kirkland was the engagement partner on the Firm’s audit of Flamemaster’s 2003 
financial statements, and Whitney was the reviewing partner on the audit.  Kirkland and Whitney 
participated in the preparation and issuance of the Flamemaster audit report. 

       6.     By order dated June 8, 2005, the Board accepted an offer of settlement made by 
the Firm and disapproved an application for registration it had submitted based in part on the 
Firm’s violation of Section 102(a) of the Act in issuing the Flamemaster audit report.5
                                                                                      The order 
effectively prevented the Firm from becoming registered with the Board until after October 1, 
2005.6
        Kirkland and Whitney have only worked as accountants through the Firm since before 

4 
       During the course of the Commission’s investigation, the Firm voluntarily reimbursed 
Flamemaster $25,800 in audit fees.  In view of the Firm’s reimbursement, the Commission is not 
ordering disgorgement in this matter. 
5 
       PCAOB Release No. 2005-012 (June 8, 2005).  The order also found that the Firm’s 
issuance of the Flamemaster audit report violated Board Rule 2100, which implemented Section 
102(a) of the Act.  Id. 
6 
       The order states that with respect to any new registration application the Firm submits 
after October 1, 2005, the Board will not issue a notice of hearing to determine whether to 
approve or disapprove such application based solely on the violations subject to the Board’s 
order.  Id.  The Board noted in its order that it had received a registration application from the 
Firm on December 30, 2003.  The Board issued a Notice of Hearing on that application dated 

                                               3

the Board’s order and have not otherwise been associated with a public accounting firm 
registered with the Board. 

C.     VIOLATIONS 

       1.     Section 102(a) of the Act provides that “it shall be unlawful for any person that is 
not a registered public accounting firm to prepare or issue, or to participate in the preparation or 
issuance of, any audit report with respect to any issuer.”7 

       2.     The provisions of Section 102(a) of the Act became effective on October 22, 
2003.8 

       3.     Based on the conduct described above, the Firm willfully 9
                                                                         violated Section 102(a) 
of the Act. 

       4.     Based on the conduct described above, Kirkland and Whitney caused the Firm’s 
violation of Section 102(a) of the Act. 

D.     FINDINGS 

       Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that the Firm willfully violated Section 
102(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and that Kirkland and Whitney caused the Firm’s 
violation of Section 102(a) of the Act. 

February 2, 2004.  In response, the Firm requested a hearing but then, withdrew its application 
before a determination by the Board.  Id. 
7 
       A violation of the Act or any rule that the Board issues under the Act is treated for all 
purposes in the same manner as a violation of the Exchange Act, including with respect to 
penalties.  Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 15 U.S.C.A. § 7202(b)(1) (West 2002). 
8 
       Section 102(a) became effective “[b]eginning 180 days after the date of the determination 
of the Commission under Section 101(d)” of the Act that the Board was prepared to undertake its 
statutory responsibilities.  The Commission made the required determination on April 25, 2003.  
See Order Regarding Section 101(d) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Securities Act Release 
No. 8223, Exchange Act Release No. 47746, 2003 WL 1956164  (Apr. 25, 2003). 
9 
       “Willfully” as used in this Offer means intentionally committing the act that constitutes 
the violation.  There is no requirement that the actor also be aware that he is violating a rule or 
statute.  See Wonsover v. SEC, 205 F.3d 408, 414 (D.C. Cir. 2000); Tager v. SEC, 344 F.2d 5, 8 
(2d Cir. 1965).
