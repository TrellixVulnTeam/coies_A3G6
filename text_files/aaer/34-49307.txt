B.
Background
Ralphs operates retail grocery stores in southern California.
In March 1998, Fred Meyer acquired Ralphs and its parent Food 4 Less.
At that time, Hall was Ralphs' controller and chief accounting officer.
In June 1998, Ralphs promoted Hall to senior vice president of finance and administration.
Hall served in that position until January 12, 1999.
Four months later, in May 1999, Kroger acquired Fred Meyer, Food 4 Less, and Ralphs.
Approximately sixteen months after the acquisition, Kroger's internal auditors confirmed the existence of seven general liability accounts on Ralphs' general ledger that were used for general and unspecified purposes (the "General Liability Accounts").
These General Liability Accounts contained insufficiently supported transactions.
Kroger engaged outside professionals to investigate the activity in the General Liability Accounts.
On March 5, 2001, Kroger announced that as a result of its investigation it would restate earnings for fiscal years 1998, 1999, and the first two quarters of 2000 to conform with generally accepted accounting principals (GAAP).
In a press release dated March 5, 2001, Kroger stated that Ralphs had engaged in certain improper accounting practices that began more than one year before Fred Meyer acquired Ralphs.
Kroger also announced specific adjustments to its financial statements.
These adjustments restated amounts that had been improperly placed in the seven General Liability Accounts, and corrected the reduction of the General Liability Accounts in later periods.
It affected Kroger's net income, earnings per share, and assets, and liabilities as follows:
1998*
1999
Q1 2000
Q2 2000
Net Income ($ millions

(.01)
Total Assets ($ millions)

Total Liabilities ($ millions)

As evidence of the effect on Kroger of the restatement, in its press release on March 5, 2001, Kroger disclosed the following changes to its prior financial statements:
EARNINGS PER SHARE*
Fiscal Period

Restated
1998*
$ 0.58
$ 0.59

$ 0.24

Q2, 1999
$ 0.06

Q3, 1999

Q4, 1999

Q1, 2000
$ 0.12
$ 0.12
Q2, 2000
$ 0.26
$ 0.25
Kroger's adjustments also affected the fiscal year 1998 pre-tax income of Fred Meyer.
In that year, the adjustments, on balance, released amounts from the General Liability Accounts that had the effect of increasing Fred Meyer's reported income (before income taxes, extraordinary items, and adjustments for GAAP changes) by $16.36 million or 8.9 percent.
According to the restatement, the reported earnings should have been greater than originally reported for Fiscal Year 1998.
More specifically, Kroger's adjustments for the first three quarters of Fiscal Year 1998 (the three interim periods Hall was involved) amounted to $2.92 million of the total $16.36 million of adjustments for the year.
Unsupported Balances in Balance Sheet Accounts
For Ralphs' fiscal year 1998, Ralphs misstated its earnings.
Ralphs placed excess income in the General Liability Accounts on its balance sheet instead of recognizing the income immediately through its income statement in conformity with GAAP.
When an accounts receivable employee at Ralphs received an atypical, or non-recurring, check or other income receipt, Ralphs, on occasion, recorded that item in one of the General Liability Accounts that functioned without proper documentation or accounting basis as reserve accounts.
Ralphs also inflated certain expenses and correspondingly built up the General Liability Accounts.
Then, from time to time, Ralphs transferred amounts from the General Liability Accounts into income without proper documentation or accounting basis.
One of these General Liability Accounts was Account 122118 (Accounts Receivable Transfers).
By May 1998, Ralphs had recorded at least $1,302,000 in receipts related to Ralphs' racecar and $833,000 from fees collected from certain marketing promotions into subledgers of Account 122118.3 On June 1, 1998, Ralphs transferred these amounts into a grocery income account.
Likewise, by August 6, 1998, an additional $1,902,000 in racecar receipts and advance payments from an egg supplier had accumulated in subledgers to Account 122118.
Ralphs also transferred these amounts into a grocery income account.
Instead of being directed to the General Liability Accounts and held there pending a subsequent transfer into income, these receipts should have been consistently recognized as income when earned.
Ralphs also placed excess expense accruals in the General Liability Accounts.
By the end of a period, if operating expenses reported to the accounting department (such as repairs, maintenance, and supplies) lagged behind forecasted expenses, Ralphs booked additional, estimated expenses, often conforming expenses to forecast.
At period end, Ralphs transferred the amount of expenses, as adjusted, into one of the General Liability Accounts, such as account number 239133 (Other Liabilities).
Quarter End Dispersals from the General Liability Accounts
At the end of each quarter, including year-end, Ralphs used journal entries to transfer substantial portions of the balances of the General Liability Accounts to other liability accounts.
At the beginning of the next period, Ralphs automatically reversed these journal entries and restored the pre-existing balances to the General Liability Accounts.
This process had the effect of reducing the balances in the General Liability Accounts at quarter end.
For the period 1997 to 1999, each of Ralphs' successive controllers made these reversing journal entries at quarter end on Ralphs' general ledger.
In fact, no one other than the controller or his assistant made these adjustments to the trial balance at the end of the quarters.
Ralphs continued to make unsupported adjustments, including reversing journal entries, at the end of each quarterly period for each of the three years.
Hall's responsibility for overseeing the accounts ceased after the third quarter of 1998.
Respondent's Conduct
Respondent Hall served as Ralphs' controller and chief accounting officer until June 1998, when Ralphs promoted him to Senior Vice President for Finance and Administration.
He served in that position until January 12, 1999.
During that time, Ralphs transferred items into the General Liability Accounts without proper documentation or accounting basis.
Hall knowingly failed to implement a system of internal accounting controls to detect or prevent this practice.
As a result, Ralphs, and successively, Fred Meyer's, and Kroger's books, records, and accounts did not fairly reflect Ralphs' transactions and the dispositions of its assets as they accrued, and Ralphs and its parent companies failed to file accurate reports with the Commission.
C.
As a result of the conduct described above, Respondent Hall committed violations of Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and was a cause of Ralphs' violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder that occurred during, or related to, Ralphs' first three quarters of 1998.
IV.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions specified in Respondent Hall's Offer.
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:
Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Respondent Hall cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Section 13(b)(5) and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and from causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder.
By the Commission.
