File No. 3-12792 

IN THE MATTER OF HALT, BUZAS & POWELL, LTD. AND WAYNE A. 
POWELL, CPA, AND STEVEN R. HALT, CPA 

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced the 
issuance of an Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings 
Pursuant to Sections 4C and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 102(e) 
of the Commission’s Rules of Practice (Order) against Halt, Buzas & Powell, Ltd. (Halt 
Ltd.), Wayne A. Powell, CPA (Powell), and Steven R. Halt, CPA (Halt). 

The Order alleges that Halt Ltd. prepared and issued and Powell and Halt participated in 
the preparation and issuance of three audit reports on the financial statements of a public 
company in 2004, without first registering with the Public Company Accounting 
Oversight Board (Board).  Section 102(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-
Oxley Act) prohibits accounting firms not registered with the Board from preparing or 
issuing audit reports with respect to any issuer after October 22, 2003.  The Order alleges 
that, by this conduct, Halt Ltd., Powell, and Halt lacked the requisite qualifications to 
represent others and that Halt Ltd. willfully violated Section 102(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act. 

Based on the above, the Order institutes cease-and-desist proceedings against Halt Ltd. 
pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), as well as 
proceedings under Section 4C(a)(1) and 4C(a)(3) of the Exchange Act and Rules 
102(e)(1)(i) and 102(e)(1)(iii) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, and as to Powell and 
Halt, Section 4C(a)(1) and Rule 102(e)(1)(i), to determine whether the allegations in the 
Order are true, whether a cease-and-desist order should be entered against Halt Ltd., whether 
Halt Ltd., Powell, and Halt should be censured or temporarily or permanently denied the 
privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant, and whether 
Halt Ltd. should be ordered to pay disgorgement. 

A hearing will be scheduled before an administrative law judge to determine whether the 
allegations in the Order are true, to provide Halt Ltd., Powell, and Halt an opportunity to 
dispute these allegations, and to determine what sanctions, if any, are appropriate.  The 
Order directs the Administrative Law Judge to issue an initial decision in this matter no later 
than 300 days from the date of service of the Order.
