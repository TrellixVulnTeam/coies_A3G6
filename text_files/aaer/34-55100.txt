                                                  I. 
 
              The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) deems it appropriate and in the 
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against Glenn 
E. Glasshagel (Respondent or Glasshagel) pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(i) of the Commissions 
Rules of Practice.1
                      
                                                    
                                                  II. 
 
              In anticipation of the institution of these  proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the Offer) whic h the Commission has determined   to accept.  Solely for the 
                                                 
1
 Rule 102(e)(3)(i) provides, in relevant part, that: 
 
       The Commission, with due regard to the public  interest and without preliminary hearing, 
       may, by order, . . . suspend from appearing or practicing before it any . . . accountant . . . 
       who has been by name . . . permanently enjoin ed by any court of competent jurisdiction, 
       by reason of his or her misconduct in an action brought by the Commission, from 
       violating or aiding and abetting the violati on of any provision of the Federal securities 
       laws or of the rules and regulations thereunder.

purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings 
herein, except as to the Commissions jurisd  iction over him and the subject matter of these 
proceedings, and the findings contained in S ection III.3 below, which are admitted, Respondent 
consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Rule 102(e) 
of the Commissions Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions as to 
Glenn E. Glasshagel (Order), as set forth below.   
 
                                              III. 
 
              On the basis of this Order and Respondents Offer, the Commission finds that:  
 
       1.          Glasshagel, age 60, was  a certified public accountant  licensed to practice in the 
States of California and Illinois until 2001.  Glasshagel served as Chief Financial Officer, Principal 
Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer of Roadhouse Grill, Inc. (Roadhouse) from 
1998 until he resigned during approximately July 2000. 
        
       2.         Roadhouse, a Florida co  rporation with its corporat e headquarters in Pompano 
Beach, Florida, is a restaurant chain.  At all relevant times, Roadhouse was an issuer subject to the 
reporting requirements of Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act).  
Roadhouse was listed on the NASDAQ National  Market from November 1996 until July 2001, 
when NASDAQ halted quotations in Roadhouses stock after the company delayed the filing of its 
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 29, 2001.  In May 2002, Roadhouse was delisted from 
NASDAQ. 
 
       3.          On July 15, 2005, the Commission filed a complaint against Glasshagel in the 
United States District Court, Sout hern District of Florida.  [ SEC v. Glenn E. Glasshagel , Civil 
Action No. 05-61159-Cooke].  On  October 31, 2006, the court entered an order permanently 
enjoining Glasshagel, by consent, from future vi olations of Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the 
Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder, and aiding and abetting violations 
of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 
13a-13 thereunder.  The Court also barred Glasshag  el from serving as an officer or director 
pursuant to Section 21(d)(2) of the Exchange Act. 
 
             4.          The Commissions complaint alleged, among other things, that from at least 1999 
 through 2000, Glasshagel violated the federal securities laws when he fraudulently manipulated 
 Roadhouses income by (1) making improper ad justments to the companys expense accounts 
 and (2) recognizing fictitious revenue.  Glassh  agels financial chicanery violated Generally 
 Accepted Accounting Principles and materially   misrepresented Roadhouses net income in 
 financial statements filed w ith the Commission during fiscal   years 1999 and 2000.  This 
 overstatement of net income a  llowed Roadhouse to   meet or exceed an outside analysts 
 estimates.  As a result of Glas shagels misconduct, Roadhouse overstated its net income by at 
 least 5% for the fiscal year ended April 25, 1999, and by approximately 35% for the fiscal year 
 ended April 30, 2000.

                                                                                   IV. 
                                                                                       
             In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
impose the sanction agreed to in Respondent Glasshagels Offer. 
 
             Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that: 
 
             A.        Respondent Glasshagel is suspended                                        from appearing or practicing before the 
Commission as an accountant.   
 
 By the Commission.
