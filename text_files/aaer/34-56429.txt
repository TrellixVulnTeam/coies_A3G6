File No.3-12790 

IN THE MATTER OF CHOI DOW IAN HONG & LEE ACCOUNTANCY 
CORPORATION AND ERNEST E. DOW, CPA  

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced the 
issuance of an Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Section 4C of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice 
(Order) against Choi Dow Ian Hong & Lee Accountancy Corporation (Choi Dow) and 
Ernest E. Dow, CPA (Dow). 

The Order alleges that Choi Dow prepared and issued and Dow participated in the 
preparation and issuance of an audit report on the financial statements of a public company 
in 2004, without first registering with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
(Board).  Section 102(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley Act) 
prohibits accounting firms not registered with the Board from preparing or issuing audit 
reports with respect to any issuer after October 22, 2003.  The Order alleges that, by this 
conduct, Choi Dow and Dow lacked the requisite qualifications to represent others and that 
Choi Dow willfully violated Section 102(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.    

Based on the above, the Order institutes proceedings against Choi Dow and Dow pursuant 
to Section 4C(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 
102(e)(1)(i) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, and additionally as to Choi Dow, 
Section 4C(a)(3) of the Exchange Act and Rule 102(e)(1)(iii) of the Commission’s Rules of 
Practice, to determine whether the allegations in the Order are true, and whether they should 
be censured or temporarily or permanently denied the privilege of appearing or practicing 
before the Commission as an accountant.   

A hearing will be scheduled before an administrative law judge to determine whether the 
allegations in the Order are true, to provide Choi Dow and Dow an opportunity to dispute 
these allegations, and to determine what sanctions, if any, are appropriate.  The Order directs 
the Administrative Law Judge to issue an initial decision in this matter no later than 300 
days from the date of service of the Order.
