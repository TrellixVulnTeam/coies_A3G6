       On April 5, 2011, we issued an order instituting proceedings ("OIP") against Michael C. 
Pattison, a certified public accountant ("CPA"), pursuant to Commission Rule of              
Practice 102(e)(3),  that temporarily suspended him from appearing or practicing before the1

       1 
              Rule of Practice 102(e)(3)(i), 17 C.F.R. § 201.102(e)(3)(i), provides, in pertinent 
part, that: 

       (i)  The Commission, with due regard to the public interest and without preliminary 
       hearing, may, by order, temporarily suspend from appearing or practicing before it 
       any . . . accountant . . . who has been by name: 

              (A)  permanently enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction, by reason of his 
              or her misconduct in an action brought by the Commission, from violating or 
              aiding and abetting the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or 
              of the rules and regulations thereunder; or 

              (B)  found by any court of competent jurisdiction in an action brought by the 
              Commission to which he or she is a party or found by the Commission in any 
              administrative proceeding to which he or she is a party to have violated (unless 
              the violation was found not to have been willful) or aided and abetted the 
              violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or of the rules and 
              regulations thereunder.

Commission as an accountant.  2 
                                 Pattison has filed a petition, pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(ii), 3 
requesting that his temporary suspension be lifted. 

       Pattison was controller of Embarcadero Technologies, Inc. ("Embarcadero"), from 
January 2000 through July 2005. 4 
                                   On September 9, 2008, the Commission filed a complaint in 
the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that Pattison, 
among other things, knowingly falsified numerous books, records, and accounts in connection 
with the backdating of stock options granted to Embarcadero's employees from 2000        
through 2005.  The complaint further alleged that Pattison knowingly circumvented 
Embarcadero's internal accounting controls to avoid recording compensation expenses related to 
the backdated, in-the-money, stock options during the same time period. 

       A jury found that Pattison violated Section 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act       
of 1934, which prohibits persons from "knowingly circumvent[ing] . . . a system of internal 
accounting controls or knowingly falsify[ing] any [required] book, record, or account."5 
                                                                                         The jury 
also found that Pattison violated Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, which prohibits persons from 
"directly or indirectly, falsify[ing] any [required] book, record, or account."6 
                                                                             On 
February 23, 2011, the district court entered an amended final judgment against Pattison 
permanently enjoining him from violating Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Exchange Act 
Rule 13b2-1. 7 
               The final judgment, as amended, further ordered Pattison to pay $74,446 in 
disgorgement, plus prejudgment interest, and a second-tier civil monetary penalty of $50,000. 

       In issuing the OIP, we found it "appropriate and in the public interest" that Pattison be 
temporarily suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission, based on the district 
court's final judgment.  We stated that the temporary suspension would become permanent unless 
Pattison filed a petition challenging it within thirty days of service of the order, pursuant to Rule 
of Practice 102(e)(3)(ii).  We further advised that, pursuant to Rule of Practice 102(e)(3)(iii),

Feb. 23, 2011).  The district court noted, in enjoining Pattison, that he "currently holds a position 
as an accountant in a private trading company, and is still a licensed CPA, eligible to return to the 
public accounting field."  Id. at *7.

upon receipt of such a petition, we would either "lift the temporary suspension, or set the matter 
down for hearing . . . , or both." 

       In his petition, Pattison argues that the temporary "suspension is premature" because he 
has filed a "meritorious motion to amend the [final judgment]" with the district court and because 
he "will appeal any adverse ruling on his motion."  He requests that the Commission lift the 
temporary suspension "until that motion, and the potential appeal, are decided."  Pattison also 
contends that the "suspension is inappropriate and excessive in light of the nature of the case," 
noting that the jury dismissed several charges against him, "absolv[ing]" him of any wrongdoing 
with respect to the "antifraud and disclosure provisions of the . . . Exchange Act."  He further 
contends that the district court used "an improper standard for the requisite intent" under 
Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and challenges the evidence used against him at trial, claiming 
the Commission improperly relied on Embarcadero's financial statements and "elicit[ed] 
improper expert testimony about complicated accounting rules from lay witnesses."  In addition, 
Pattison also claims that the OIP erroneously states that he was enjoined from "indirect" 
violations of Section 13(b)(5), urges the Commission to issue a more "definitive statement" 
regarding his misconduct, and requests the opportunity "to present additional briefing . . . and 
proposed findings . . . before any administrative hearing and decision."  The Division of 
Enforcement opposes Pattison's petition.      

       Rule 102(e)(3) permits the Commission to suspend any accountant or other professional 
or expert who has been "permanently enjoined from violating . . . the Federal securities laws or 
of the rules and regulations thereunder; or . . . found by any court of competent jurisdiction in an 
action brought by the Commission . . . to have violated . . . the . . . Federal securities laws or rules 
and regulations thereunder.'"8 
                                Although Pattison is entitled to appeal the underlying case against 
him, neither the pendency of his current motion before the district court nor the possibility of an 
appeal to the court of appeals "alter[s] the effect" of the jury's finding of securities law violations 
or the court's imposition of an injunction, here.9 
                                                  Generally, a respondent in a "follow-on" 
proceeding is precluded from challenging the basis for, or findings in, the underlying injunctive 
action.10 
          At this stage, it appears that the findings made in the injunctive proceeding and the 
injunction issued against him justify continuing his suspension "until it can be determined what,

if any, action may be appropriate to protect the Commission's processes." 11 
                                                                             As provided in 
Rule 102(e)(3)(iii), therefore, we will set the matter down for public hearing.  We note that 
Pattison's other claims concerning the present proceeding – i.e., that the OIP is incorrect and that 
a more definitive statement is needed – are more appropriately addressed, in the first instance, by 
the law judge in the context of administering the hearing.  The law judge may order and schedule 
the filing of an answer to the OIP, pursuant to Rule of Practice 220.12 
                                                                       We express no opinion as 
to the merits of Pattison's claims. 

       Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that this proceeding be set down for public hearing before 
an administrative law judge in accordance with Rule of Practice 110.  As specified in Rule of 
Practice 102(e)(3)(iii), the hearing in this matter shall be expedited in accordance with Rule of 
Practice 500; it is further  

       ORDERED that the administrative law judge shall issue an initial decision no later    
than 210 days from the date of service of this order; and it is further 

       ORDERED that the temporary suspension of Michael C. Pattison, entered on            
April 5, 2011, remain in effect pending a hearing and decision in this matter. 

       By the Commission.
