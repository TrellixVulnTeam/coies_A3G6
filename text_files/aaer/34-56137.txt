                                     :      IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

 ______________________________: 

                                              I. 

        The Securities and Exchange Commission (ACommission@) deems it appropriate and in 
 the public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against 
 Patrick E. Chew (ARespondent@ or AChew@) pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(i) of the Commission's 
 Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R. ' 201.102(e)].1 

                                              II. 

        In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an 
 Offer of Settlement (the AOffer@) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for 
 the purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 
 Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the 
 findings herein, except as to the Commission=s jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of 

1 
       Rule 102(e)(3)(i) provides, in relevant part, that: 

       The Commission, with due regard to the public interest and without preliminary hearing, may, by order, . . . 
suspend from appearing or practicing before it any . . . accountant . . . who has been by name . . . permanently 
enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction, by reason of his or her misconduct in an action brought by the 
Commission, from violating or aiding and abetting the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or of 
the rules and regulations thereunder. 
---------------------Page 2---------------------

 these proceedings, and the findings contained in Section III. 3 below, which are admitted, 
 Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant 
 to Rule 102(e) of the Commission=s Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing 
 Remedial Sanctions (AOrder@), as set forth below. 

                                               III. 

        On the basis of this Order and Respondents= Offer, the Commission finds 2
                                                                                  that: 

        1.     Chew, age 40, was the controller of SmartForce=s U.S. subsidiary, which 

 generated 70 percent of the Company=s business, from January 1998 until February 2002.  

 Chew was responsible for recognizing revenue on standard agreements but did not set or 

 otherwise determine the Company=s revenue recognition policy.  During all relevant times, 

 Chew was a certified public accountant. 


        2.     SmartForce PLC (ASmartForce@), now known as SkillSoft PLC (ASkillSoft@), was 
 at all relevant times a company organized under the laws of the Republic of Ireland with its 
 principal place of business in Redwood City, California.  SmartForce provided Internet-based 
 training courseware and professional services geared toward business and IT professionals.  At 
 all relevant times, SmartForce=s common stock was registered with the Commission pursuant to 
 Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and trades on NASDAQ National Market. 

        3.     On July 19, 2007, the Commission filed a complaint against Chew in SEC v. 
 Patrick T. Chew (Civil Action No. 07CV220).  On July 23, 2007, the court entered an order 
 permanently enjoining Chew, by consent, from future violations of Section 13(b)(5) of the 
 Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-2 thereunder, and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 
 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 
 thereunder.  Chew was also ordered to pay $67,559 in disgorgement, representing losses 
 avoided as a result of the conduct alleged in the Complaint, and $18,326 in prejudgment 
 interest; and a $25,000 civil money penalty. 

        4.     The Commission=s complaint alleged, among other things, that Chew engaged in 
 improper accounting practices which resulted in SmartForce filing materially false and 
 misleading financial statements in the company=s quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the second 
 and third quarters of fiscal year 2001, and in the company=s annual report on Form 10-K for the 
 fiscal year ended December 31, 2001.  These practices included improperly recognizing 
 revenue from non-binding agreements and from a transaction for which no product was shipped 
 to the customer.  As a result of these practices, SmartForce=s annual and quarterly revenue and 
 net income were materially increased. 
2 
       The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent= Offer of Settlement and are not binding on any other 
person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

                                              IV. 

       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest 
to impose the sanctions agreed to in Respondent Chew=s Offer. 

       Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that: 

       A.     Respondent is suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission as 
an accountant. 

       B.     After three (3) years from the date of this order, Respondent may request that the 
Commission consider his reinstatement by submitting an application (attention: Office of the 
Chief Accountant) to resume appearing or practicing before the Commission as: 

              1.      a preparer or reviewer, or a person responsible for the preparation or 
review, of any public company's financial statements that are filed with the Commission. Such 
an application must satisfy the Commission that the Respondent's work in his practice before 
the Commission will be reviewed either by the independent audit committee of the public 
company for which he works or in some other acceptable manner, as long as he practices before 
the Commission in this capacity; and/or 

              2.      an independent accountant. Such an application must satisfy the 
Commission that:  

                      (a)    Respondent, or the public accounting firm with which he is 
associated, is registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("Board") in 
accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and such registration continues to be 
effective; 

                      (b)    Respondent, or the registered public accounting firm with which 
he is associated, has been inspected by the Board or equivalent Canadian organization and that 
inspection did not identify any criticisms of or potential defects in the Respondent's or the firm's 
quality control system that would indicate that the Respondent will not receive appropriate 
supervision; 

                      (c)    Respondent has resolved all disciplinary issues with the Board or 
equivalent Canadian organization, and has complied with all terms and conditions of any 
sanctions imposed (other than reinstatement by the Commission); and  

                      (d)    Respondent acknowledges his responsibility, as long as the 
Respondent appears or practices before the Commission as an independent accountant, to 

                                              3 

---------------------Page 4---------------------

comply with all requirements of the Commission and the Board, including, but not limited to, 
all requirements relating to registration, inspections, concurring partner reviews and quality 
control standards. 

       C.     The Commission will consider an application by Respondent to resume 
appearing or practicing before the Commission provided that his certified public accountant 
and/or chartered accountant license is current and he has resolved all other disciplinary issues 
with the Board or applicable Canadian organization.  However, if licensure is dependent on 
reinstatement by the Commission, the Commission will consider an application on its other 
merits.  The Commission's review may include consideration of, in addition to the matters 
referenced above, any other matters relating to the Respondent's character, integrity, 
professional conduct, or qualifications to appear or practice before the Commission. 

       By the Commission.
