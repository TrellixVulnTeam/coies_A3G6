 I. 
 
              The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) deems it appropriate and in 
the public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against 
Michael D. Karsch (Respondent or Karsch)  pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3) of the Commissions

 II. 
 
              In anticipation of the institution of these  proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer

Commission, or to which the Commission is a party         and without admitting or denying the 
findings herein, except as to the Commissions jurisd iction over him and the subject matter of 
these proceedings, and the findings c  ontained in Section III., Paragraph 3,   below, which are 
admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of th is Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings 
Pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commissions Ru les of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing 
Remedial Sanctions (Order), as set forth below.   
 
                                               III. 
 
              On the basis of this Order and Respondents Offer, the Commission finds that: 
 
       1.           Karsch, age 45, is an attorney licensed to practice in Florida, Texas and New York.   
        
       2.           2DoTrade was, at all relevant times, a Nevada corporation with its principal place of 
business in British Columbia, Canada, and London, England.  2DoTrade was purportedly engaged in 
an import/export business.  2DoTrades comm  on stock was registered with the Commission 
pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and its shares 
were quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board. 
 
       3.          On September 30, 2003, the Commission filed a complaint against Karsch and 
others in SEC v. 2DoTrade, Inc., et al.  (Civil Action No. 3:03-CV-2246/NDTX).  On March 29, 
2006, the court entered an order permanently enjoining Karsch, by consent, from future 
violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, a nd Section 10(b) of the 
Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Karsch was ordered to pay $2,721 in disgorgement of 
ill-gotten gains from his sales of stock while pa rticipating in the fraud, and $238 in prejudgment 
interest.    
 
       4.          The Commissions complaint alleged that  certain defendants engaged in a pump 
and dump scheme designed to inflate 2DoTrades        stock price.  Between at least June and 
November 2001, the defendants, among other things      , issued materially false and misleading 
press releases claiming that 2DoTrade had entered into several large international trading 
contracts and had developed an anti-anthrax compound.  During the same period, the defendants 
sold shares of 2DoTrade stock for illegal tradi ng profits of at least  $1.8 million.  The complaint 
alleged further that Karsch assisted the defendants in perpetrating and executing the scheme, and 
that MCG Partners, Inc., of which Karsch was a   director, sold shares of 2DoTrade for illegal 
trading profits.

              In view of the foregoing, the Commission deem s it appropriate and in the public interest 
to impose the sanction agreed to in Respondent Karschs Offer. 
 
             Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effectiv                                          e immediately, that Karsch is suspended 
from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an attorney.   
       
              By the Commission.
