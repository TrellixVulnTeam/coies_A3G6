 1         Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") alleges 
 2  as follows: 
 3                           JURISDICTION  AND VENUE 
 4         1.     This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(b), 
 5  20(d)(1), 20(e), and 22(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act"), 15 
 6  U.S.C.  §§ 77t(b), 77t(d)(1), 77t(e), and 77v(a), and Sections 21 (d)(1), 21 (d)(2), 
 7   21(d)(3)(A), 21(e), and 27 ofthe Securities Exchange Act  of 1934 ("Exchange 
 8  Act"),  15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d)(1), 78u(d)(2), 78u(d)(3)(A), 78u(e) & 78aa. 
 9  Defendants have directly or indirectly made use  of the means or instrumentalities 
10   of interstate commerce, ofthe mails, or ofthe facilities ofa national securities 
11   exchange in connection with the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of 
12   business alleged in this Complaint. 
13         2.    Venue   is proper in this district pursuant to Section 22(a) of the 
14 )Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. § 77v(a), and Section 27 of the Exchange Act,  15 U.S.C. 
15   § 78aa, because Defendants reside and transact business within this district and 
16   certain of the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of conduct constituting 
17   violations of the federal securities laws alleged in this Complaint occurred within 
18   this district. 
19                                      SUMMARY 
20         3.    This action involves securities offering fraud and reporting violations 
21   committed by Michael   W. Perry ("Perry"), the former Chief Executive Officer and 
22  Chairman   of the Board of IndyMac Bancorp, Inc. ("IndyMac"), and    A. Scott Keys 
23  ("Keys"), the former Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer  of 
24  IndyMac.  Perry and Keys are collectively referred to herein as "Defendants." 
25         4.    IndyMac through its main subsidiary - IndyMac Bank, F.S.B. 
26  ("IndyMac Bank" or "the Bank") - primarily made, purchased, and sold residential 
27  mortgage loans.   In July 2008, IndyMac Bank was placed under Federal Deposit

---------------------Page 3---------------------

 1  Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") receivership and IndyMac filed for bankruptcy 
 2  protection. 
 3          5.    In 2008, Defendants knowingly or recklessly participated in 
 4  IndyMac' s filing  of false and misleading disclosures of its financial condition in 
 5  Fonns  10-K,   IO-Q, and/or 8-K, as well as in offering documents for $100 million 
 6  in stock sales.  During that time period, Defendants regularly received information 
 7  regarding IndyMac's rapidly deteriorating financial condition.  Despite receiving 
 8  this information, Defendants participated in the filing of IndyMac's periodic 
 9  reports and stock offering disclosures that made false and materially misleading 
10   statements and omissions regarding:  (1) IndyMac's  liquidity; (2) IndyMac's 
II   capital raising needs and activities; and (3) IndyMac Bank'scapital  ratio, a key 
12   regulatory metric of a bank's  safety and soundness.  Among other things, as 
13   discussed below, Defendants signed a false and misleading Fonn  10-K issued on 
14   February 29,2008  and authorized the filing of one or more false and misleading 
15   prospectuses.  In addition, Perry signed false and misleading Fonns  IO-Q and 8-K 
16   and made a false and misleading statement during   an earnings call relating to 
17   IndyMac's   Ql 2008 results.  Shortly after IndyMac partially disclosed its dire 
.18  liquidity problems in reports for its first quarter 2008 filed on May 12, 2008, 
19   IndyMac Bank was put into FDIC receivership and IndyMac declared bankruptcy. 
20          6.    Based on their conduct, Defendants violated and/or aided and abetted 
21   violations of the antifraud and reporting provisions of the federal securities laws. 
22  The Commission seeks     an order enjoining Defendants from future violations  of the 
23   securities laws, requiring Defendants to disgorge their ill-gotten gains with 
24  prejudgment interest, ordering Defendants to pay civil monetary penalties, barring 
25   Defendants from serving   as an officer or director of a public company, and 
26  providing other appropriate relief.

 1                               THE DEFENDANTS 
 2         7.    Michael W.  Perry is a resident of San Marino, California.  He was 
 3  IndyMac's Chief Executive Officer since 1998 and Chainnan    of the Board of 
 4  Directors since 2003.  Perry was licensed as a CPA in California until his license 
 5  was cancelled  in 1997. 
 6         8.    A. Scott Keys is a resident of La Caiiada Flintridge, California.  He 
 7  was IndyMac's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer from March 
 8  2002 until April 25, 2008, when he took a medical leave of absence.  Keys is 
 9  licensed as a CPA in California. 
10                               RELATED PARTIES 
11         9.    IndyMac was a Delaware corporation with principal executive offices 
12  in Pasadena, California.  Its common stock was registered with the Commission 
13  pursuant to Section 12(b) ofthe Exchange Act and traded on the NYSE until 
14  August  18, 2008, when it was delisted and withdrawn from registration pursuant to 
15  Rule 12d2-2(b)  of the Exchange Act.  Its common stock  is currently quoted on the 
16  Pink Sheets operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc.  IndyMac filed for Chapter 7 
17  bankruptcy on July 31, 2008. 
18         10.   IndyMac Bank was a federally-chartered thrift institution regulated by 
19  the Office ofThrift Supervision ("OTS") and headquartered in Pasadena, 
20  California.  On July 11, 2008, the OTS closed IndyMac Bank and placed it under 
21  FDIC receivership. 
22                                       FACTS 
23  A.     Background 
24         11.   At the end of 2007, IndyMac was a publicly-traded company whose 
25  primary operating subsidiary was IndyMac Bank.  As a thrift, IndyMac Bank was 
26  subject to regulatory capital requirements that measure a bank's safety and 
27  soundness.  One such measurement, the total risk-based capital ratio (the "capital 
28  ratio"), is calculated by dividing a thrift's  total risk-based capital (e.g., shareholder 

                                            3
 
---------------------Page 5---------------------

 1  equity) by total risk-weighted assets (i.e., the greater the presumed risk of an asset, 
 2  the greater the risk weighting and the reserved capital needed to support the asset). 
 3         12.   Under the OTS's regulations and 2000 order approving IndyMac's 
 4  acquisition of IndyMac Bank, IndyMac Bank was required to maintain a capital 
 5  ratio of 10% or more  tobe considered "well-capitalized."  IndyMac Bank would 
 6  suffer significant regulatory consequences if its capital ratio fell below the 10% 
 7  well-capitalized threshold, including: 
 8               a.	    An inability to accept (without a waiver from the FDIC) 
 9                      brokered deposits (i.e., funds deposited by brokers for third 
10                      parties that receive higher interest rates), which would likely 
11                      curtail IndyMac Bank's lending business; 
12               b.	    Potentially increased costs, including borrowing costs from the 
13                      Federal Home Loan Bank, insurance premiums to the FDIC, 
14                      and payments to the OTS; and 
15               c.	    The OTS and FDIC could impose various restrictions or 
16                      remedial requirements. 
17         13.   As the CFO, Keys supervised the two IndyMac departments that 
18   forecasted IndyMac's financial results, including IndyMac Bank's capital ratio. 
19   Perry and Keys received frequent and, by March 2008, daily forecasts of the 
20  Bank's  capital ratio bye-mail  and in meetings.  Keys also supervised IndyMac's 
21   investor relations department, which managed IndyMac' s Direct Stock Purchase 
22  Plan ("DSPP").  Under the DSPP, investors could purchase $10,000 or more     of 
23   IndyMac's  common stock at a 1% to 2.5% discount to market price.  Perry and 
24  Keys received regular reports on capital raising through the DSPP.

 1  B.	   Material  Omissions   and  Misstatements   in IndyMac's   2007 Annual 
 2         Report  and  2008 Stock Sales 
 3         1.	   IndyMac's   Negative 2007 Results   and  Positive 2008 Forecast 
 4         14.   On February 12,2008,  IndyMac reported its 2007 results   of 
 5  operations and financial condition in a Fonn 8-K ("2007 Earnings 8-K"), which 
 6  included  as exhibits an earnings press release (the "2007 Press Release"), a 
 7  shareholder letter (the "2007 Shareholder Letter") and a presentation entitled 
 8  "IndyMac Bancorp, Inc. Fourth Quarter Review" (the "2007 Presentation").  Perry 
 9  and Keys signed IndyMac's 2007 Earnings 8-K, and Perry signed the 2007 
10   Shareholder Letter.  Although IndyMac acknowledged in the 2007 Earnings 8-K 
11   that IndyMac had a "terrible" 2007 and had lost $509 million in the fourth quarter 
12   and $615 million during fiscal 2007, the 2007 Press Release assured investors that 
13   IndyMac had finished the quarter in a "solid overall financial position" and had a 
14  "game plan" that gave it a "realistic shot" at a $13 million profit in 2008.  IndyMac 
15   further assured investors that even if its 2008 forecast was wrong, "we have the 
16   capital ... to absorb nearly triple our presently forecasted 2008 credit costs and 
17   fight our way through until the housing and mortgage markets do stabilize." 
18         15.   The 2007 Earnings 8-K also made positive statements and forecasts 
19   regarding IndyMac's Bank's capital ratio.  In the 2007 Earnings 8-K, IndyMac 
20  stated that IndyMac Bank's capital ratio was 10.50% at the end of2007,  and was 
21   thus above the 10% well-capitalized threshold.  IndyMac went on to state that 
22  "[w]e believe that, under current regulations, the bank will continue to meet its 
23   'well-capitalized'  minimum capital requirements in the foreseeable future," and 
24  that "[w]e are currently forecasting that our balance sheet size will decline and our 
25  capital ratios will increase over the course of 2008 as we execute our revised 
26  business model  of primarily GSE ["Government Sponsored Enterprise"] lending." 
27  IndyMac's  2007 Presentation similarly had positive forecasts for IndyMac Bank's 
28  capital ratio, including a projected 10.59% capital ratio at March 31, 2008. 

                                              5
 
---------------------Page 7---------------------

 1          16.   In addition, the 2007 Shareholder  Letter stated that the "only good 
 2   news" is that, even with its significant  annual and quarterly losses, IndyMac 

 3   remained in a "fundamentally  sound financial position"  and that IndyMac  Bank's 

 4   "capital levels continue to  exceed the levels defined as 'well capitalized' by our 

 5  regulators."  The 2007 Shareholder  Letter assured IndyMac's  investors that "based 

 6   on our new business model    ... we are forecasting  a small profit in 2008 .,. as we 

 7   believe we can maintain  our 'well-capitalized'  capital ratios even under worsening 

 8   industry conditions." 

 9          17.   IndyMac's  2007 Earnings  8-K also informed investors that given its 
10   strong levels of capital and liquidity,  IndyMac  did not intend to raise capital in 

11   2008.  IndyMac's  2007  Shareholder  Letter stated that "we want to try and avoid 

12   raising capital externally right now given our current stock price relative to book 
13   value per share, as any capital raised would  be highly dilutive to existing 

14·  shareholders."  Similarly, IndyMac's  2007   Prese~tation  stated that "due to our low 

15   stock price to book value per share, our 2008 plan does not rely on the capital 

16   markets for raising capital; instead we plan to eliminate the dividend  [on common 
17   shares] and shrink the balance  sheet," thereby improving  IndyMac's  capital 

18   position by $318 million.  The 2007 Presentation  also forecasted that the number 

19   of diluted shares outstanding  would not increase, thereby further emphasizing  that 

20  IndyMac  did not expect to raise capital through stock  sales. 
21          18.   The 2007 Earnings  8-K also touted IndyMac's  liquidity,  including its 

22   cash position,  stating in the 2007 Presentation  that IndyMac had: 

23                a.     $64 million in cash at year end 2007 to pay future preferred 

24                       dividends  of $7.3 million per quarter; 

25                b."enough        cash to pay [preferred dividends] for over 2 years 

26                       without any dividends  from the Bank or additional  debt   or 

27                       equity raised";  and 

28   III 

                                                6 
---------------------Page 8---------------------

 1               c.	    "the right to defer dividend payments on [preferred securities] 
 2                      for up to five years; [but it did] not expect to have to exercise 
 3                      this right." 
 4         2.	   IndyMac's   Fraudulent   DSPP Sales to Protect   IndyMac   Bank's 
 5               Capital  Ratio and  Pay  Preferred Dividends 
 6         19.   IndyMac' s capital and liquidity levels and its "realistic" plan to return 
 7  to profitability in 2008 began to unravel just one week after it filed its 2007 
 8  Earnings 8- K.  On or about February 19, 2008, Keys informed Perry and other 
 9  IndyMac executives that a significant one-day rise in interest rates caused IndyMac 
10   Bank's  forecasted capital ratio at March 31 to be right at or slightly under 10%.  In 
11   response, Perry sent Keys and other IndyMac executives an e-mail stating that 
12  IndyMac would raise up to $50 million by selling stock through the DSPP.  In his 
13   e-mail, Perry wrote that IndyMac would use DSPP sales proceeds to   (l) keep the 
14  Bank's  capital ratio above 10% by contributing $25 to $50 million to IndyMac 
15   Bank and (2) pay future preferred dividends. 
16                a)	   IndyMac's   False and  Misleading  DSPP Sales   through  the 
17                      October  11,2007  Prospectus 
18         20.   On February 26, 2008, IndyMac began selling its common shares 
19  through the DSPP pursuant to a June 30, 2006 Form S-3 automatic shelf 
20  registration statement and an October 11, 2007 prospectus.  Perry and Keys signed 
21   IndyMac's  June 30, 2006 Form S-3.  As a member    of IndyMac's board  of 
22  directors, Perry had authorized the offer and sale ofstock through the October 11 
23  DSPP prospectus, while Keys authorized the filing   of that prospectus.  In those 
24  offering documents, IndyMac represented that it "intend[ ed] to use the net 
25  proceeds from sales  of common stock   ... for general corporate purposes, including 
26  investment in [its] subsidiaries."  Pursuant to Item 504 of Regulation S-K of the 
27  Securities Act, 17 C.F.R. § 229.504, the DSPP prospectus was required to disclose 
28  "the principal purposes for which the net proceeds to the registrant from the 

                                              7
 
---------------------Page 9---------------------

 1  securities to be offered are intended to be used and the approximate amount 
 2  intended to be used for each such purpose."  IndyMac's  DSPP prospectus did not 
 3  disclose that it planned to use $25 to $50 million of net offering proceeds for a 
 4  capital contribution to IndyMac Bank and to use the remaining proceeds to pay 
 5  future preferred dividends. 
 6         21.   IndyMac's June 30, 2006 Form S-3 registration statement and each 
 7  prospectus filed pursuant to that registration statement incorporated by reference, 
 8  among other things, all ofIndyMac' s future filings with the Commission until the 
 9  offering terminated.  As such, IndyMac's registration statement and October II, 
10   2007 prospectus incorporated by reference its 2007 Earnings 8-K, which, as 
11   alleged above, contained representations regarding IndyMac' s strong capital and 
12   liquidity positions. 
13         22.   Perry and Keys knowingly or recklessly failed to disclose (either 
14   through a new prospectus, an amendment to the October 11, 2007 prospectus, or a 
15  Form 8-K) that, contrary to the 2007 Earnings 8-K, IndyMac's  capital and liquidity 
16   levels were rapidly deteriorating and that IndyMac was selling stock to raise 
17   capital for the purpose ofprotecting IndyMac Bank's capital ratio and paying 
18  preferred dividends.  Such information would have been material to reasonable 
19   investors, who would have viewed the precarious state of IndyMac's  capital and 
20  liquidity levels and the true reasons for IndyMac' s stock sales as important to their 
21   assessment of their risk ofloss and the price they would be willing to pay for 
22  IndyMac' s common stock. 
23         23.   From February 26 through 29, 2008, when it filed its 2007 
24  Form 10-K, IndyMac raised approximately $11.3 million through the DSPP. 
25               b)	   IndyMac's  False  and  Misleading  2007  Form  10-K  and 
26                     Resulting  Fraudulent  DSPP Sales 
27         24.   On February 29,2008,  IndyMac filed its 2007 Form 10-K, which was 
28  signed by Perry and Keys.  IndyMac's  2007 Form 10-K repeated many     of the 

                                             8
 
---------------------Page 10---------------------

 1  positive statements in its 2007 Earnings 8-K, including:  "We have a solid and a 
 2  realistic plan that we believe will return IndyMac to profitability in 2008."  The 
 3  2007 Form 10-K also made positive disclosures regarding IndyMac's current 
 4  liquidity and capital needs: 
 5                a.	   "We currently believe our liquidity level is sufficient to satisfy 
 6                      our operating requirements and meet our obligations and 
 7                      commitments in a timely and cost effective manner"; 
 8                b.	    "As a result of our ... strong capital and liquidity positions, we 
 9                      were not forced to sell assets at liquidation prices and our [loan] 
10                      funding capacity was not materially impacted"; 
11                c.	   While the Bank "currently [has] regulatory capital ratios in 
12                      excess of the 'well capitalized'  requirement and [has] 
13                      implemented a plan to ... increase our capital ratios, there can 
14                      be no assurance that [the Bank] will not suffer material losses 
15                      or that [IndyMac' s] plans ... will succeed.  In those 
16                      circumstances, [IndyMac] may be required to seek additional 
17                      regulatory capital to maintain our capital ratios at the 'well 
18                      capitalized'  level"; and 
19                d.	   IndyMac "may be required to raise capital at terms that are 
20                      materially adverse to shareholders." 
21         25.   These statements about IndyMac's capital raising activity were false 
22   and misleading when IndyMac filed its 2007 Form 10-K. As Perry and Keys 
23   knew, IndyMac's  capital position was not "strong" because IndyMac Bank's 
24   capital ratio was projected to be right at or slightly below 10%.  In addition, 
25   Defendants knew that the statement in IndyMac's Form 10-K that it    "may"  raise 
26   capital at terms that are materially adverse to shareholders was false and 
27   misleading, as IndyMac already had begun raising new capital on February 26, 
28   2008 at a price (average $6.93 per share) that was highly dilutive relative to book 

                                              9
 
---------------------Page 11---------------------

 1  value ($16 per share) as a result of IndyMac's plan to raise up to $50 million 
 2  through the DSPP.  Furthermore, Defendants knew that IndyMac' s liquidity 
 3  position was weakening and it needed to raise new capital to protect its well­
 4  capitalized regulatory status and to pay preferred dividends in future quarters. 
 5         26.   Pursuant to the terms ofIndyMac's June 30,2006  Form S-3 
 6  registration statement and October 11, 2007 prospectus, the above false and 
 7  misleading statements in the 2007 Form 10-K were also incorporated by reference 
 8  into the DSPP prospectus dated October   11, 2007. 
 9         27.   Perry and Keys knowingly or recklessly failed to disclose (either 
10  through a new prospectus, an amendment to the October 11, 2007 prospectus, or a 
11  Form 8-K) that, contrary to the 2007 Form 10-K, IndyMac's  capital and liquidity 
12  levels were rapidly deteriorating and that IndyMac was in fact selling stock to raise 
13  capital for the purpose of protecting IndyMac Bank's capital ratio and paYing 
14  preferred dividends.  The omitted information would have been material to 
15  reasonable investors, as they would have viewed IndyMac's declining capital and 
16   liquidity levels and the true reasons for IndyMac's stock sales as important to their 
17  assessment  of their risk of loss and the price they would be willing to pay for 
18  IndyMac's  common stock. 
19         28.   From March   10 through Apri13, 2008, when it filed a new DSPP 
20  prospectus, IndyMac raised approximately $36.3 million through the DSPP. 
21               c)     IndyMac's   False and Misleading  April  3, 2008 Prospectus 
22         29.   On March 20, 2008, Keys recommended to Perry that IndyMac 
23   contribute $75 million to IndyMac Bank on March 31, 2008 for the principal 
24  purpose  of protecting IndyMac Bank's capital ratio.  Keys believed that $75 
25  million was the most that could be contributed to IndyMac Bank while leaving 
26  IndyMac with enough money to meet its cash flow needs.  Based on a $75 million 
27  contribution at March 31, Perry and Keys knew that IndyMac would be left with 
28   only $16 million in cash, which was enough to pay only two quarters of future 

                                             10
 
---------------------Page 12---------------------

 1  preferred dividends.  Perry and Keys agreed to reduce IndyMac's capital 
 2  contribution from $75 million to $70 million after IndyMac's treasurer raised 
 3  concerns about IndyMac' s dwindling cash. 
 4         30.   After the $70 million capital contribution on March 31, 2008, Perry 
 5  and Keys knew that IndyMac was left with about    $21  million in cash, which was 
 6  enough   to pay only three quarters ofpreferred dividends without raising additional 
 7  capital or receiving dividends from IndyMac Banle 
 8         31.   On April 3, 2008, IndyMac filed a prospectus registering the offer of 
 9  an additional ten million common shares through the DSPP.  As a member     of 
10  IndyMac' s board  of directors, Perry authorized the offer and sale ofadditional 
11   stock through the DSPP.  Keys authorized the filing of the April 3 prospectus, 
12  which was the first public disclosure that IndyMac was raising capital in 2008. 
13   The prospectus contained the same generic disclosure that IndyMac "intend[ed] to 
14  use the net proceeds from [the offering] for general corporate purposes, including 
15   investment in our subsidiaries" and incorporated disclosures in the 2007 Earnings 
16  8-K and 2007 Form 10-K regarding IndyMac's  strong capital and liquidity 
17  positions. 
18         32.   As Perry and Keys knew, or were reckless in not knowing, the generic 
19  disclosures in IndyMac's April 3, 2008 prospectus were false and misleading.  By 
20  incorporating IndyMac's 2007 Earnings 8-K and 2007 Form 10-K, the prospectus 
21   repeated the false and misleading disclosures regarding IndyMac's strong capital 
22  and liquidity positions that were contained in those earlier filings.  Indeed, by the 
23  time IndyMac filed its April 3 prospectus, its liquidity position had deteriorated 
24  even further as a result of having contributed $70 million of its $91 million in cash 
25  to IndyMac Bank to protect the Bank's  capital ratio.  Defendants also knew, or 
26  were reckless in not knowing, that IndyMac's  generic disclosure concerning the 
27  use  ofproceeds from DSSP sales was false and misleading,   as IndyMac failed to 
28  disclose that it was forced to raise new cash for the purpose of protecting IndyMac 

                                             11

 1  Bank's capital ratio and paying future preferred dividends.  As alleged above, 
 2  reasonable investors would have found the above information material in that it 
 3  would have been important to their investment decision. 
 4         33.   From April 4 through April 24, IndyMac raised approximately $30.5 
 5  million through the DSPP. 
 6               d)	   IndyMac   Bond  Rating  Downgrades    and Keys'  Departure 
 7                     from  IndyMac 
 8         34.   IndyMac's  capital and liquidity positions deteriorated even further in 
 9  late April 2008, when Moody's  Investors Service downgraded   165 mortgage-
10  backed securities ("MBS") sponsored by IndyMac Bank on April 23, and Standard 
11  &  Poor's downgraded  251  IndyMac Bank-sponsored MBS on Apri128.  IndyMac 
12   Bank held on its balance sheet $160 million in downgraded bonds as ofMarch 31, 
13  2008 and recorded a $9.5 million write-down expense during the quarter ended 
14   March 31, thereby lowering IndyMac Bank's first quarter 2008 capital ratio.  Perry 
15  and Keys knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that the bond downgrades would 
16  negatively impact IndyMac Bank's  capital ratio in future quarters because 
17  additional capital would be required to support the downgraded, and hence riskier, 
18  MBS. 
19         35.   On April 24, 2008, the day after Moody's ratings downgrade, Keys 
20  left IndyMac on medical leave.  By that date, IndyMac had raised a total of $78.1 
21  million through the DSPP since sales began on February 26,2008. 
22               e)	   IndyMac's   False and  Misleading  DSPP Sales  through  the 
23                     April  3, 2008 Prospectus after Bond Downgrades 
24         36.   After the bond downgrades, Perry knew, or was reckless in not 
25  knowing, that IndyMac had no choice but to suspend preferred dividends  as a way 
26  to conserve cash. It was also clear that the downgrades could drive IndyMac 
27  Bank's capital ratio below 10% at March 31, and that IndyMac would not have

 1  sufficient cash to both keep IndyMac Bank's  capital ratio above 10% and pay
 
 2  future preferred dividends.
 
 3         37.   Perry knowingly or recklessly failed to disclose (either through a new 
 4  prospectus, an amendment to the April 3, 2008 prospectus, or a Form 8-K) that the 
 5  April bond rating downgrades jeopardized IndyMac Bank's  ''well-capitalized'' 
 6  status such that IndyMac would need to conserve cash by suspending future 
 7  preferred dividends.  The impact  of the bond rating downgrades to IndyMac's 
 8  capital and liquidity would have been material information to reasonable investors' 
 9  assessment  of their risk of loss and the price they would be willing to pay for 
10   IndyMac's  common stock through the DSPP. 
11         38.   From April 24 through May 2, 2008, when it filed a new DSPP 
12   prospectus, IndyMac raised approximately $15 million through the DSPP. 
13               f)     IndyMac's   False and  Misleading  May   2, 2008 Prospectus 
14         39.   By no later than May 2,2008,  Perry knew, or was reckless in not 
15   knowing, that based on internal forecasts, IndyMac would have to suspend future 
16   preferred dividend payments as a result of the continuing decline in IndyMac's 
17   liquidity and capital positions. 
18         40.   On May 2,2008,  IndyMac filed with the Commission a new 
19   prospectus registering the offer of another ten million common shares.  As a 
20·  member  of IndyMac's  board  of directors, Perry authorized the offer and sale of 
21   additional stock through the DSPP.  This prospectus again stated that IndyMac 
22  "intend[ed] to use the net proceeds from [the offering] for general corporate 
23   purposes~ including investment in our subsidiaries."  By incorporating by reference 
24  the 2007 Earnings 8-K and 2007 Form 10-K, the May 2 prospectus repeated those 
25   earlier filings' statem~nts regarding IndyMac's  strong capital and liquidity 
26  positions, its cash holdings being sufficient to pay future preferred dividends for 
27   over two years, and its positive forecasts for the Bank's  capital ratio.  From May 3 
28   through May 9,2008,  IndyMac raised $9.4 million through the DSPP.  May 9 was 

                                             13

 1  the last trading day before May 12, when IndyMac filed its Form 10-Q for the 
 2  quarter ended March 31, 2008 and all DSPP sales ended. 
 3         41.   The May 2 prospectus failed to disclose that the DSPP offering's 
 4  specific purpose was to raise capital to protect IndyMac Bank's  capital ratio. 
 5  IndyMac needed the additional capital to protect IndyMac Bank's capital ratio, 
 6  which was close to the 10% "well-capitalized" threshold as a result of the April 
 7  bond rating downgrades.  In addition, contrary to the disclosures in the 2007 
 8  Earnings 8-K and 2007 Form 10-K, which were incorporated by reference in the 
 9  May 2 prospectus, IndyMac' s liquidity position had deteriorated as a result of 
10   IndyMac's  $70 million cash contribution to the Bank on March 31, such that 
11   IndyMac would have to suspend future preferred dividend payments. 
12         42.   Perry knowingly or recklessly failed to disclose (either through a new 
13   prospectus, an amendment to the April  3,2008  prospectus, or a Form 8-K) this 
14   information to investors until May 12,2008,  when IndyMac's Form 10-Q and 8-K 
15   disclosed, among other things, the suspension of future preferred dividends and 
16   that IndyMac Bank's capital ratio would have been 9.27%   if the risk-weighting 
17   impact of the April bond downgrades had been required   to have been recorded as 
18   of March 31.  Such information would have been material to investors, as they 
19   would have viewed the true reasons for IndyMac's  stock sales and its declining 
20  capital and liquidity levels as important to their assessment of their risk of loss and 
21   the price they would be willing to pay for IndyMac's  common stock.  When 
22  IndyMac partially disclosed its deteriorating capital and liquidity positions on May 
23   12,2008,  IndyMac's common stock price closed at $3.06, an   11 % drop from its 
24  prior close of $3.43, on volume of 4.8 million shares.  On May 13, IndyMac's 
25   stock price fell an additional 24%, closing at $2.32 on volume of 14.9 million 
26  shares.

 1  C.	    IndyMac's   False and  Misleading  012008    Forms  10-0  and  8-K and 
 2         Earnings  Call 
 3         43.   Before the market opened on May 12,2008,  IndyMac filed its Form 
 4  10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2008   ("Ql  Form 10-Q") and a Form 8-K 
 5  with the quarter's  earnings release and presentation and shareholder letter ("Ql 
 6  Earnings 8-K").  These filings disclosed: 
 7               a.	    IndyMac' s suspension  of future preferred dividends; 
 8               b.	    IndyMac Bank's  capital ratio was 10.26% at March 31, 
 9                      exceeding "the levels defined as 'well capitalized'  by [IndyMac 
10                      Bank's]  regulators"; 
11               c.	    IndyMac Bank's  capital ratio would have been 9.27%   if 
12                      IndyMac Bank had recorded the risk-weighting impact    of the 
13                      April 2008 bond downgrades at March    31 (Q1  Form 10-Q 
14                      only); 
15               d.	    IndyMac Bank's  capital ratio would have been 11.36% but for 
16                      two regulations relating to the risk-weighting ofmortgage 
17                      servicing rights and allowance for loan losses; and 
18               e.	    IndyMac "contributed  $88 million to ... Bank during Q1 08" 
19                      (Q1 Earnings 8-K only). 
20         44.   During IndyMac's   Q1  ,2008 earnings conference call on May 12, 
21   2008, Perry stated that IndyMac "contribute[d]  $88 million ...  to [IndyMac B]ank 
22   during the first quarter to remain well capitalized." 
23         45.   IndyMac's  statements regarding IndyMac Bank's  capital ratio and 
24  capital contributions in the May 12 filings and earnings conference call were 
25  materially false and misleading.  As discussed below, IndyMac Bank's  capital ratio 
26  would have been 9.86%,    belowthe  10% the well-capitalized threshold,  but for the 
27   fact that IndyMac had:

 1               a.	    changed how it calculated IndyMac Bank's risk-based capital 
 2                      ratio so that IndyMac Bank needed less capital to support its 
 3                      subprime loan holdings; and 
 4               b.	    backdated an $18 million capital contribution to IndyMac Bank 
 5                      made on May 9 (over five weeks after quarter end) to March  31 
 6                      (quarter end). 
 7         1.	   The  Change   in the Calculation of IndyMac   Bank's  Capital  Ratio 
 8         46.   In a February 19,2008  e-mail, Perry informed Keys and other 
 9  IndyMac executives that to keep IndyMac Bank's capital ratio above 10% at 
10   March 31, he planned to request relief from three OTS requirements for the 
11   calculation of IndyMac Bank's capital ratio, which Perry calculated would 
12   collectively add an additional 1.48% to the Bank's capital ratio.  One ofthe 
13   regulatory requirements from which Perry wanted relief was the requirement that 
14   subprime loans be double risk-weighted as compared to non-subprime loans.  In 
15   calculating IndyMac Bank's capital ratio, subprime loans required $1 of capital for 
16   every $1 of subprime loan, compared to only $.50  of capital required for every $1 
17   of non-subprime loan.  Perry wrote that relief from the subprime double risk-
18   weighting requirement would improve IndyMac Bank's  capital ratio by   0.31 %. 
19         47.   Perry and Keys purportedly obtained relief from the requirement to 
20  double risk-weight subprime loans during a telephone call with an OTS official on 
21   February 26,2008.  The effect of this reliefwas  to reduce the amount of capital 
22  that IndyMac Bank needed    to meet the 10% well-capitalized threshold.  With the 
23   benefit ofthis relief, Perry and Keys expected IndyMac Bank's  capital ratio to stay 
24  at or above 10%  at March 31, 2008.  Indeed, had IndyMac not made this 
25  undisclosed change, IndyMac Bank's risk-based capital ratio at March   31 would 
26  have been below the 10% well-capitalized threshold at 9.86% (or 9.96% with the 
27  $18 million backdated capital contribution discussed below).

 1         48.   Perry knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that IndyMac's  Ql  Form 
 2  10-Q, and  Ql  Earnings 8-K were false and misleading  in that they failed to 
 3  disclose that IndyMac Bank's well-capitalized status was based, in part, on the 
 4  change in the method by which IndyMac calculated its capital ratio, so that it was 
 5  no longer based on the double risk-weighting  of subprime loan assets. 
 6         2.    IndyMac's   Backdated  Capital   Contribution 
 7         49.   In early May 2008, Perry learned that $15.7 million in unrecorded 
 8  profit and loss review differences compiled by IndyMac's  outside auditing firm 
 9  (the "Auditors") were material because,  if booked, they would have caused 
10   IndyMac Bank's  capital ratio to fall to 9.98%, below the 10% well-capitalized 
11   threshold.  After IndyMac failed to persuade the Auditors that the unrecorded 
12   review differences should not be booked, IndyMac was faced with the choice   of 
13   either delaying its Ql Form 10-Q filing on May 12,2008   or filing a Ql Form 10-Q 
14   that reported a capital ratio below 10%.  To avoid that dilemma, on May 9,2008, 
15   Perry authorized IndyMac to contribute to IndyMac Bank $18 million (which was 
16   nearly all the cash that IndyMac had on March 31) as of March 31.  Perry 
17   purportedly received OTS approval to record the $18 million contribution as if it 
18   had occurred on March 31, 2008 and considered IndyMac Bank's  capital as   of that 
19   date.  That backdated capital contribution allowed IndyMac Bank to keep its 
20  capital ratio above 10% even  if the Auditors'  review differences were recorded. 
21   As a result of this undisclosed backdated capital contribution, IndyMac reported in 
22  its Ql filings that IndyMac Bank's  capital ratio was above the 10% well-
23   capitalized threshold (10.26% instead of9.98%  with the unrecorded review 
24  differences but without the backdated contribution). 
25         50.   Perry knew, or was reckless· in not knowing, that the Ql Form 10-Q 
26  and  Ql Earnings 8-K were false and misleading in that IndyMac Bank had 
27  remained well-capitalized based, in part, on this backdated capital contribution.

 1  D.     Defendants'  Roles in IndyMac's   False and  Misleading  Disclosures 
 2         51.   As the CEO and CFO during IndyMac's financial meltdown in 2008, 
 3  Perry and Keys were well aware   of IndyMac' s deteriorating capital and liquidity 
 4  positions.  Each of them regularly received updated forecasts for IndyMac Bank's 
 5  capital ratio, reports on capital raising through the DSPP, and information on 
 6  material events such as downgrades on MBS bonds held by IndyMac Bank. 
 7  Despite being well informed  of IndyMac's  financial condition and integral 
 8  participants in IndyMac's financial reporting process, Defendants knowingly or 
 9  recklessly failed to disclose the extent of IndyMac's deteriorating capital and 
10   liquidity positions to both existing shareholders and purchasers of common stock 
11   through the DSPP. 
12         1.    The  Periodic and  Current  Reports 
13         52.   Perry and Keys signed the 2007 Form 10-K (and the accompanying 
14   Sarbanes-Oxley certifications), while Perry signed the Ql Form 10-Q (and the 
15   accompanying Sarbanes-Oxley certification) and the  Ql  Earnings 8-K. 
16         53.   Perry was actively involved in preparing the exhibits to Ql Earnings 
17   8-K, including the attached earnings press release and presentation and shareholder 
18   letter.  For example, in a draft ofpresentation attached to the Ql Earnings 8-K, 
19   Perry changed the accurate statement that IndyMac "contributed $70 million to ... 
20  [IndyMac] Bank during    Ql 08 and another $[18] million on May 9th" to falsely 
21   state that IndyMac "contributed $88 million to the Bank during Ql 08." 
22         54.   As the CFO, Keys was responsible for supervising IndyMac's 
23   financial reporting department.  He received and reviewed multiple versions of the 
24  2007 Form 10-K, inCluding a review with the audit committee    of IndyMac's  board 
25   of directors prior to the annual report's  filing on February 29,2008. 
26         55. - Despite their responsibility for and participation in the filing of

 1  recklessly failed to take any action to ensure that IndyMac' s capital raising 
 2  activities and deteriorating capital and liquidity positions were fairly and 
 3  accurately disclosed in IndyMac's periodic and current reports. 
 4         2.	   The DSPP Offering 
 5         56.   Perry and Keys signed the Form S-3 registration statement and 
 6  approved the dollar amounts and timing  of capital raised through the DSPP.  As a 
 7  member   of IndyMac's  board of directors, Perry authorized the offer and sale of 
 8  common stock and the preparation and filing  of each DSPP prospectus by the CEO 
 9  or his delegate.  As IndyMac's  CFO (and the CEO's delegate), Keys approved the 
10   filing ofthe October 11,2007  and April 3,2008  DSPP prospectuses. 
11         57.   Perry and Keys also knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that 
12   certain actions were taken to increase the amount of capital raised by the DSPP 
13   prior to the release ofIndyMac's  first quarter 2008 financial results: 
14               a.	    On or about March  5, 2008, the window period for DSPP sales 
15                     was shortened from up to twelve days to just one or two days. 
16                      Since DSPP sales were contingent on IndyMac's  volatile 
17                      common stock price exceeding a certain threshold during a 
18                     window   of time, shortening the window improved the 
19                     likelihood that IndyMac stock would exceed the threshold 
20                     price; and 
21               b.	   On or about April 4, 2008, Perry recommended postponing 
22                     IndyMac' s earnings release date from May 1to May    12 to give 
23                     IndyMac "the maximum time possible to    ... raise capital 
24                     through the DSPP."  At the time, there were a number  of 
25                     unresolved regulatory, accounting, and auditor issues that could 
26                     negatively affect Q1 2008 results and future DSPP  sales.. The 
27                     delay in the earnings release date permitted IndyMac to raise 
28                     $13.3 million through the DSPP between May 1 and     12. 

                                            19

 1         58.   Despite their responsibility for and participation in IndyMac's  DSPP 
 2  offering and, as discussed above, their knowledge of IndyMac's  deteriorating 
 3  financial condition, Defendants knowingly or recklessly failed to take any action to 
 4  ensure that the DSPP offering documents fairly and accurately disclosed 
 5  IndyMac's  deteriorating financial condition. 
 6         3.    01  2008 Earning   Call 
 7         59.   During IndyMac's   Ql 2008 earnings conference call on May 12, 
 8  2008, Perry stated that IndyMac had "contribute[d] $88 million ... to [the B]ank 
 9   during the first quarter to remain well capitalized." 
10         60.   Perry's statement was materially false and misleading because 
11  IndyMac had only contributed $70 million to the Bank during the first quarter of 
12   2008.  The remaining $18 million had been contributed on May 9, 2008, over five 
13   weeks after the end ofthe first quarter.  Without the backdated contribution, 
14   IndyMac was faced with the choice  ofeither delaying its Q1 10-Q filing on May 
15   12, 2008 or filing the Q1 10-Q with a capital ratio below 10%. 
16                DEFENDANTS       BENEFITED      FROM    THE   FRAUD 
17         61.   During the period at issue, Perry and Keys received substantial 
18   salaries and incentive-based and other forms of compensation.
