 1         Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) for its 
 2  Complaint against Defendants China Sky One Medical, Inc. (CSKI) and Yan-
 3  qing Liu (Liu) alleges as follows: 
 4                           JURISDICTION AND VENUE 
 5         1.    This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(b), 
 6  20(d)(1), and 22(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) [15 U.S.C. §§ 
 7  77t(b), 77t(d)(1), & 77v(a)], and Sections 21(d)(1), 21(d)(3)(A), 21(e), and 27 of 
 8  the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d)(1), 
 9  78u(d)(3)(A), 78u(e), & 78aa].  Defendants have, directly or indirectly, made use 
10  of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, of the mails, or of the 
11  facilities of a national securities exchange, in connection with the transactions, 
12  acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in this complaint. 
13         2.    Venue is proper in this district pursuant to Section 22(a) of the 
14  Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v(a)], and Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 
15  U.S.C. § 78aa], because certain of the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of 
16  conduct constituting violations of the federal securities laws occurred within this 
17  district.  During the relevant period, CSKIs securities were traded within this 
18  District, and CSKIs subsidiary American California Pharmaceutical Group, Inc. 
19  was registered with the Secretary of State of California.  
20                                     SUMMARY 
21         3.     This is a financial fraud case involving the fabrication of export sales 
22  and the material overstatement of financial results for 2007 and 2008 by the 
23  Defendants.   
24         4.    Defendant CSKI is a company based in Harbin, Helongjiang Province, 
25  the Peoples Republic of China.  It manufactures and sells medicinal products, 
26  including a slim patch that purports to promote weight loss.  Its common stock is 
27  registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act [15 
28

                                             -1-

 1  U.S.C. § 78l(g)], and trades in the United States.  Defendant Liu is CSKIs CEO and 
 2  chairman of the board.  
 3         5.    In 2007, CSKI reported in its filings with the Commission that it had 
 4  entered into a strategic distribution agreement with a Malaysian company, Takasima 
 5  Industries (M) Sdn. Bhd (Takasima), pursuant to which Takasima was appointed as 
 6  CSKIs exclusive distributor in Malaysia and undertook to generate $1 million per 
 7  month in sales.  In its public filings, CSKI reported export sales to Malaysia of over 
 8  $12.2 million for 2007 (constituting 25% of total revenues), and about $7.5 million 
 9  for 2008 (constituting 8.2% of total revenues).  All of these purported sales were for 
10  one product, CSKIs slim patch.   
11         6.    CSKIs Form 10-K for 2007 also identified its top two customers, 
12  Ningbo Yuehua International Trading Company (Yuehua) and Guangzhou Xinghe 
13  International Trading Company (Xinghe), which collectively accounted for 25% of 
14  its total revenues for 2007.  CSKI claims that Yuehua and Xinghe were sales agents 
15  for Takasima, and that all of CSKIs sales to Yuehua and Xinghe were export sales to 
16  Malaysia via Takasima.   
17         7.    In fact, Takasima only purchased a total of $167,542 in slim patches 
18  from CSKI for 2007, a mere fraction of what was reported in CSKIs public filings, 
19  and did not make any purchase from CSKI for 2008.  Moreover, Takasima never 
20  entered into any distribution agreement with CSKI and never had any relationship 
21  with, or purchased any goods through, Yuehua and Xinghe.   
22         8.    CSKI materially overstated its financial results for 2007 and 2008 in its 
23  Forms 10-K and 10-Q, and a current report on Form 8-K, and fabricated its strategic 
24  distribution relationship with Takasima in those filings.  The overstated financial 
25  results continued to appear in CSKIs financial statements through 2010, and 
26  continue to impact the companys retained earnings on its balance sheet up to the 
27  present.  CSKI also used the materially overstated financial results in its private 
28  placement of securities in 2008.

 1         9.    CSKI has failed to file its annual report on Form 10-K for the year 
 2  ended December 31, 2011, and Forms 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2012 
 3  and June 30, 2012.   
 4         10.   By virtue of the conduct alleged herein, CSKI and Liu, directly or 
 5  indirectly, singly or in concert, violated and are otherwise liable for violations of the 
 6  federal securities laws, as follows: 
 7               (a)       CSKI violated Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §

 9  [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b), 15 U.S.C. §§ 78m(a), 78m(b)(2)(A), and 78m(b)(2)(B)], and 
10  Rules 10b-5(b), 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder [17 C.F.R. §§ 
11  240.10b-5(b), 240.12b-20, 240.13a-1, 240.13a-11, and 240.13a-13]; 
12               (b)      Liu violated Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C.  
13  § 77q(a)(2)], Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b) 
14  and 78m(b)(5)] and Rules 10b-5(b), 13a-14, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder [17 
15  C.F.R. §§ 240.10b-5, 240.13a-14, 240.13b2-1, and 240.13b2-2], and Section 304 of 
16  the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 [15 U.S.C. § 7243];  
17               (c)      Liu is liable, pursuant to Section 20(e) of the Exchange Act [15 
18  U.S.C. §78t(e)], for aiding and abetting CSKIs violations of Sections 13(a), 
19  13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78m(a), 
20  78m(b)(2)(A), and 78m(b)(2)(B)], and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 
21  thereunder [17 C.F.R. §§ 240.12b-20, 240.13a-1, 240.13a-11, and 240.13a-13]; and  
22               (d)      Liu is liable as a control person pursuant to Section 20(a) of the 
23  Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78t(a)] for CSKIs violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 
24  13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b), 78m(a), 
25  78m(b)(2)(A), and 78m(b)(2)(B)], and Rules 10b-5(b), 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 
26  13a-13 thereunder [17 C.F.R. §§ 240.10b-5(b), 240.12b-20, 240.13a-1, 240.13a-11, 
27  and 240.13a-13].

 1         11.   Based on these violations, the Commission seeks a final judgment: (1) 
 2  permanently enjoining CSKI and Liu from future violations of the relevant provisions 
 3  of the federal securities laws; (2) requiring Liu to disgorge certain shares of CSKI 
 4  stock; (3) imposing civil monetary penalties against CSKI and Liu pursuant to

 9  and (5) requiring Liu to reimburse CSKI his stock compensation pursuant to Section 
10  304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act [15 U.S.C. § 7243].

13  in Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, China.  It manufactures and sells medicinal and 
14  diagnostic products, and all of its operations are carried out in China.  CSKIs

16  Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78l(b)] until June 12, 2012, and continues to be registered 
17  with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act

20  counter market under the ticker symbol CSKI.    
21         13.   Yan-qing Liu, age 49, is a Chinese national residing in Harbin, 
22  Heilongjiang Province, China.  He has been CSKIs chairman, CEO and president 
23  since September 2006.  He has been on sick leave since December 19, 2011.  As of

 1         15.   Ningbo Yuehua International Trading Company purports to be a 
 2  trading company and CSKIs top customer in 2007.  Its place of incorporation and 
 3  location are unknown.   
 4         16.   Guangzhou Xinghe International Trading Company purports to be a 
 5  trading company and one of CSKIs top two customers for 2007.  It purports to be 
 6  located in Guangzhou, China.   
 7                                      FACTS 
 8  A. Background    
 9         17.   CSKI is a holding company that engages in business through several 
10  indirect subsidiaries in China.  It became an OTC Bulletin Board issuer through a 
11  reverse merger in May 2006.  Its stock traded on the American Stock Exchange under 
12  the trading symbol CSY from May to September 2008, and on the NASDAQ 
13  Global Market under the trading symbol CSKI from September 2008 to February 
14  15, 2012.  NASDAQ halted the trading following CSKIs announcement of 
15  resignation of 26 mid-level managers, including nine from the accounting department 
16  and two from internal controls function.  CSKIs external audit firm resigned on 
17  March 12, 2012, and NASDAQ filed a Form 25 to delist CSKIs stock on March 14, 
18  2012.   The stock currently trades on the over-the-counter market.  
19         18.   CSKI makes and sells Chinese traditional medicinal, health and beauty 
20  products, including pain relief and weight loss patches, sprays and ointments.   
21         19.   As a public company that trades on the U.S. markets, CSKI is required 
22  to timely file accurate annual, quarterly and current reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 
23  8-K. 
24         20.   CSKI has failed to file its annual report on Form 10-K for the year 
25  ended December 31, 2011, and Forms 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2012 
26  and June 30, 2012.

 1         21.   Liu has been on sick leave since December 2011.  However, he has not 
 2  relinquished his CEO or chairman position and continues to sign CSKIs public 
 3  filings.  CSKIs Chief Financial Officer resigned effective December 22, 2011.   
 4  B.        CSKI and Liu Made Materially False Statements in its Public Filings and 
 5        Private Placement Documents  
 6        (a)      CSKI Made Minimal Sales to Takasima and Never Entered Into a 
 7               Distribution Agreement With Takasima 
 8         22.   Takasima is a Malaysian fitness equipment manufacturer and retailer.  It 
 9  purchased a total of $167,542 in slim patches from CSKI in 2007 and stopped its 
10  purchases after March 2007.  It never entered into any distribution agreement with 
11  CSKI and never undertook (much less satisfied) any minimal purchase commitment.  
12  In addition, it never used Yuehua or Xinghe as its agent.  In fact, it never had any 
13  relationship with, or purchased any goods through, Yuehua and Xinghe. 
14        (b)      The Defendants Made Materially False Statements in CSKIs Public 
15               Filings 
16         23.   In its Form 10-K for 2007 and Forms 10-Q for the first three quarters of 
17  2007, CSKI falsely stated that that it had entered into a strategic distribution 
18  agreement with Takasima, pursuant to which Takasima was appointed as CSKIs 
19  exclusive sales agent of its slim patches in Malaysia, that Takasima would 
20  repackage and sell the patches under its Takasima brand name, that Takasima 
21  would generate sales revenue of approximately USD$1.0 million per month, and   
22  that [s]ince the signing of the agreement early this year, Takasima has fulfilled its 
23  monthly obligation.  Management anticipates that this strategic agreement could 
24  result in up to USD$12 million in additional annual sales revenue in 2007, with a net 
25  profit margin of approximately 20%.   
26         24.   CSKIs Form 10-K for 2007 identified its two alleged top customers, 
27  Yuehua and Xinghe, which CSKI claimed collectively accounted for 25% of its total 
28  revenues for 2007.   CSKI also claimed that Yuehua and Xinghe were sales agents for 

                                            -6- 
---------------------Page 8---------------------

      
 1   Takasima, all of its sales to Yuehua and Xinghe were export sales to Malaysia via 
 2   Takasima, and all such sales were for one product, CSKIs slim patch. 
 3           25.    CSKI booked sales to Yuehua and Xinghe commencing in April 2007.  
 4   These sales were not real.  The chart below shows the impact of those fake sales on 
 5   CSKIs reported financial performance for 2007 and 2008:

18            
19   In addition, the fake sales had a corresponding impact on CSKIs earnings per share 
20   and retained earnings.    
21           26.    As a result, CSKI materially overstated its financial results for 2007 and 
22   2008.  The overstated financial results continued to appear in CSKIs financial 
23   statements through 2010, and continue to impact the companys retained earnings on 
24   its balance sheet up to the present. 
25           27.    CSKIs 2007 annual report on Form 10-K falsely reported export sales 
26   to Malaysia of over $12.2 million, constituting 25% of total revenues for 2007.  In its 
27   Form 10-K for 2008, CSKI falsely reported export sales to Malaysia of about $8.8

 1  million, which number was subsequently changed to $7.5 million in its annual report 
 2  on Form 10-K for 2009, constituting 8.2% of total revenues for 2008.   
 3         28.   CSKIs Forms 10-Q for the quarters ended June 30 and September 30, 
 4  2007 and all Forms 10-Q for 2008 reflected the fake sales to Yuehua and Xinghe.  As 
 5  a result, these Forms 10-Q materially overstated CSKIs financial performance for 
 6  the relevant quarters.  
 7         29.   In a Form 8-K filed with the Commission on May 19, 2008, announcing 
 8  its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2008, CSKI included the fake 
 9  sales to Yuehua and Xinghe, and as a result materially overstated its financial 
10  performance for the quarter. 
11         30.   CSKIs Forms 10-Q and Form 10-K for 2009, as amended, included the 
12  materially overstated financial results for 2007 and the relevant quarters of 2008. 
13         31.   CSKIs Form 10-K for 2010 included the materially overstated financial 
14  results for 2008. 
15         32.   Liu participated in the preparation of and had ultimate authority over 
16  CSKIs SEC filings.  He reviewed CSKIs financial statements and was familiar with 
17  U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).  He signed all of CSKIs 
18  annual, quarterly and current reports, and signed the Sarbanes-Oxley certifications for 
19  the Forms 10-K and 10-Q.  He knew, or was at least reckless in not knowing, that 
20  CSKIs public filings contained materially overstated financial results for 2007 and 
21  2008 and false and misleading statements regarding the distribution agreement with 
22  Takasima. 
23        (c)       The Defendants Made Materially False Statements in CSKIs 
24               Private Placement Documents 
25         33.   In January 2008, CSKI raised $23.5 million from U.S. investors through 
26  a private placement.  In connection with the private placement, CSKI used selling 
27  documents that included its 2007s materially overstated financial results or the 
28  Commission filings containing such materially overstated financial results.  One of 

                                            -8-

 1  these documents was a confidential investment presentation (the investors 
 2  presentation).  This presentation contained the materially overstated financial 
 3  performance numbers for the first three quarters of 2007 and projected numbers for 
 4  the entire year, including revenue, gross profit and net income.  In the Securities 
 5  Purchase Agreement by and among CSKI and the investors, CSKI represented that it 
 6  had made available to the investors its SEC filings and that such filings contained a 
 7  complete and accurate description in all material respects of its business and did not 
 8  include any materially false or misleading statements.  The SEC filings included the 
 9  Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2007, which contains the materially 
10  overstated financial results for the first three quarters of 2007.   
11         34.   Liu was actively involved in the private placement process, and directly 
12  interacted with the U.S. investors.  He came to the U.S. for a road show, met 
13  investors and used the investors presentation in his meetings, and signed the 
14  Securities Purchase Agreement as CSKIs CEO, while he knew or was reckless in not 
15  knowing that they contained or incorporated CSKIs public filings that contained 
16  materially overstated financial results for 2007. 
17        (d)      Liu Made Misrepresentations to CSKIs Auditors 
18         35.   In his capacity as CSKIs CEO, Liu signed management representation 
19  letters to CSKIs auditors in connection with their audits of CSKIs periodic reports 
20  and other filings.  CSKIs representation letters to its auditors dated March 25, 2008 
21  and March 25, 2009 falsely represented that (1) the financial statements were fairly 
22  presented in conformity with U.S. GAAP; and (2) Liu had no knowledge of any fraud 
23  or suspected fraud affecting CSKI involving management or employees with a 
24  significant role in internal controls, or others where the fraud could result in a 
25  material misstatement to the financial statements.   
26         36.   Liu made misrepresentations to CSKIs auditors by signing the 
27  management representation letters that he knew, or was reckless in not knowing,

 1  contained material misrepresentations about sales to Takasima through Yuehua and 
 2  Xinghe. 
 3        (e)       Liu Personally Benefited from the Overstated Financial Statements 
 4         37.   In connection with the private placement, Liu entered into a Make 
 5  Good Agreement with the lead investor (acting as the Investor Agent), pursuant 
 6  to which Liu placed 3 million of his CSKI shares into escrow for the benefit of the 
 7  investors.  Under the agreement, up to the entire 3 million escrowed shares would 
 8  be distributed to the investors based on a formula if CSKIs adjusted earnings per 
 9  share (Adjusted EPS) were less than $1.05 for 2007 and $1.75 (later reduced to 
10  $1.63) for 2008.  CSKI purportedly attained the threshold Adjusted EPS for 
11  purposes of the Make Good Agreement, and the escrowed shares were returned to 
12  Liu.   
13         38.   As described above, the fabricated sales to Malaysia constituted 25% 
14  and 8.2% of total revenues for 2007 and 2008, respectively.  If the fictitious sales 
15  were excluded from the above calculation (and based on the estimated impact on 
16  net income), the Adjusted EPS would have been approximately $0.83 for 2007 and 
17  $1.57 for 2008, in each instance below the threshold amount.  As a result, and 
18  calculated based on the formula provided in the Make Good Agreement, nearly 1.4 
19  million of Lius escrowed shares would have been forfeited for the benefit of the 
20  investors.  Therefore, the overstated financial results significantly contributed to 
21  CSKIs attaining the threshold earnings numbers and Lius retention of his 
22  escrowed shares.   
23         39.   CSKIs overstated financial results also helped improve the liquidity 
24  of Lius shares.  In 2008, CSKI successfully obtained a listing on the American 
25  Stock Exchange and later on NASDAQ.    
26  C.       CSKI and Liu Falsified Books and Records 
27         40.   CSKI created and maintained books and records that falsely and 
28  inaccurately reflected the fabricated sales to Yuehua and Xinghe, including a 

                                            -10- 
---------------------Page 12---------------------

      
 1  distribution agreement with Takasima, inventory records, bank statements and 
 2  general ledgers that purported to document sales to Yuehua and Xinghe.   
 3         41.   CSKI created and maintains in its records two versions of distribution 
 4  agreement with Takasima, both of which were signed by Liu but not by anyone 
 5  from Takasima, although in fact Takasima never entered into such agreement with 
 6  CSKI.     
 7         42.   CSKI substantiated the purported sales to Yuehua and Xinghe with 
 8  Stock Release Notes, general ledgers, and bank statements from one Chinese 
 9  bank.  The Stock Release Notes purport to document sales and the release of goods 
10  from inventory.  They were fabricated because the sales never occurred.  The 
11  transactions reflected in the Stock Release Notes match CSKIs general ledgers, 
12  which categorized all transactions with Yuehua and Xinghe as revenue generating 
13  sales transactions.  Hence, the general ledgers were false at least with respect to 
14  these entries.  The bank statements were tied to the Stock Release Notes and the 
15  general ledgers with respect to the purported sales to Yuehua and Xinghe and thus 
16  were false as to these entries.  
17         43.   In connection with the audit of CSKIs financial statements, CSKI 
18  provided its outside auditors the false Stock Release Notes, and the general ledgers 
19  and bank statements reflecting the fabricated sales to Yuehua and Xinghe.   
20         44.   CSKI also maintains in its records a set of documents purporting to 
21  evidence five direct sales to Takasima in the total amount of $567,688.  The sales 
22  documentation cover one small order dated December 19, 2006, and four orders 
23  from January to April 2007, including detailed packing lists (for shipping), 
24  commercial invoices setting forth payment terms, and sales confirmations.  Some 
25  of the packaging lists and invoices bear Lius signature.  But these purported sales 
26  do not match any of Takasimas orders, the total amount is over three times more 
27  than the total amount that Takasima acknowledged as purchased from CSKI, and 
28

 1  the sales were not reflected in CSKIs general ledgers.  Ultimately CSKI admitted 
 2  that the sales represented in these documents never occurred. 
 3         45.   In addition, CSKI failed to maintain a system of internal controls 
 4  sufficient to ensure that the company accurately record and report its business and 
 5  sales transactions necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in 
 6  conformity with GAAP and to maintain the accountability of assets.  Liu signed the 
 7  false distribution agreement with Takasima as well as documents purporting to reflect 
 8  direct sales to Takasima that never occurred.  He knew or was reckless in not 
 9  knowing that CSKI used and continues to use and rely on the falsified books and 
10  records, and substantially assisted CSKI in documenting the fabricated sales to 
11  Takasima.

20                            FALSE CERTIFICATION 
21                      Violations of Exchange Act Rule 13a-14 
22                                   (Against Liu) 
23        70.   The Commission realleges and incorporates by reference ¶¶ 1 through 
24  45 above. 
25        71.   In CSKIs annual and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q for 
26  2007 through 2010, Liu certified that, among other things, he reviewed each of these 
27  reports and that: (i) based on his knowledge, the report did not contain any untrue 
28  statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the 

                                          -16- 
---------------------Page 18---------------------

     
 1  statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were 
 2  made, not misleading;  (ii) based on his knowledge, the report included financial 
 3  statements and other financial information which fairly presented, in all material 
 4  respects, CSKIs financial condition, results of operations and cash flows; and (iii) he 
 5  was responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over 
 6  financial reporting, had designed and evaluated such controls, and had disclosed any 
 7  changes or weaknesses to CSKIs auditor and audit committee.   
 8         72.   By engaging in the conduct described above, Liu violated, and unless 
 9  enjoined will continue to violate, Exchange Act Rule 13a-14 [17 C.F.R. § 240.13a-
10  14]. 
11                          NINTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF 
12          FAILURE TO REIMBURSE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION 
13                Violations of Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act  
14                                   (Against Liu) 
15         73.   The Commission realleges and incorporates by reference ¶¶ 1 through 
16  45 above. 
17         74.   CSKI, by engaging in the conduct described above, filed Forms 10-K for 
18  years 2007 through 2010, and Forms 10-Q for the period from the quarter ended June 
19  30, 2007 through 2009 that were in material noncompliance with financial reporting 
20  requirements under the securities laws and U.S. GAAP. 
21         75.   Due to CSKIs material non-compliance with its financial reporting 
22  requirements under the securities laws and GAAP, and as a result of its misconduct, 
23  CSKI was required to prepare an accounting restatement for the period from the 
24  quarter ended June 30, 2007 through 2010. 
25         76.   The Commission has not exempted Liu, pursuant to Section 304(b) of 
26  the Sarbanes-Oxley Act [15 U.S.C. § 7243(b)], from the application of Section 304(a) 
27  of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act [15 U.S.C. § 7243(a)].

 1         77.   By engaging in the conduct described above, Liu violated, and unless 
 2  ordered to comply will continue to violate, Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
 3  [15 U.S.C. § 7243]. 
 4                          TENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF  
 5                        CONRTOL PERSON LIABILITY 
 6                       Violations as CSKIs Control Person  
 7                                    (Against Liu) 
 8         78.   The Commission realleges and incorporates by reference ¶¶ 1 through 
 9  45 above. 
10         79.   As alleged above, CSKI violated Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 
11  13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b), 78m(a), 78m(b)(2)(A), and 
12  78m(b)(2)(B], and Rules 10b-5(b), 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder [17 
13  C.F.R. §§ 240.10b-5(b), 240.12b-20, 240.13a-1, 240.13a-11, and 240.13a-13].  
14         80.   During all relevant times in which CSKI undertook these violations, Liu 
15  was CSKIs most senior officer and chairman of the board of directors and had 
16  ultimate authority and control over CSKI.  He was also the largest shareholder, 
17  owning more than 27.9% of CSKIs outstanding shares.  Liu was involved in the day-
18  to-day operation of the company, actively participated in the preparation of and 
19  signed all of CSKIs Commission filings, and certified the quarterly and annual 
20  reports on Forms 10-Q and 10-K.  Hence, Liu was a control person of CSKI within 
21  the meaning of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78t(a)]. 
22         81.   By reason of the foregoing, Liu is liable as a control person pursuant to 
23  Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78t(a)] for CSKIs violations of, and 
24  unless enjoined, will continue to engage, as a control person, in conduct that would 
25  render him liable, pursuant to Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78t(a)], 
26  for CSKIs violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the 
27  Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b), 78m(a), 78m(b)(2)(A), and 78m(b)(2)(B)], and

13  them, from violating, directly or indirectly, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act [15 
14  U.S.C. § 77q(a)], Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the
