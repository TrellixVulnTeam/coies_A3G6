            The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate 
    and in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, 
    instituted against Jeffrey L. Lamson (“Respondent” or “Lamson”) pursuant to Rule 
                                                            1
    102(e)(3)(i) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice.    
                                                       

                                                     
    1
       Rule 102(e)(3)(i) provides, in relevant part, that:   
     
            The Commission, with due regard to the public interest and without preliminary 
    hearing, may, by order, . . . suspend from appearing or practicing before it any . . . 
    accountant . . . wh o has been by name . . . permanently enjoined by any court of 
    competent jurisdiction, by reason of his or her misconduct in an action brought by the 
    Commission, from violating or aiding and abetting the violation of any provision of the 
    Federal securities  laws or of the rules and regulations thereunder.

                                            II. 
 
       In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an 
Offer of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely 
for the purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of 
the Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying 
the findings herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over him and the subject 
matter of these proceedings, and the findings contained in Section III (C) below, which are 
admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative 
Proceedings Pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making 
Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (“Order”), as set forth below.   
 
                                           III. 
 
       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that:  
        
               A.     Lamson, age 50, of El Dorado Hills, California is and has been a 
certified public accountant.  From no later than January 2007 through September 2012 he 
was licensed to practice in the State of California.  His license lapsed in September 2012.   
        
               B.     From January 2007 through January 2013, Lamson participated in a 
scheme involving numerous individual participants and at least 22 undisclosed “blank 
check” companies (collectively the “Blank Check Companies”) in violation of the antifraud, 
recordkeeping, and reporting provisions of the federal securities laws.  Lamson, along with 
other individuals, recruited “sole officers” to act as sole officer, director, employee, and 
majority shareholders of the Blank Check Companies.  The Blank Check Companies 
ultimately filed false and misleading registration statements depicting them as actively 
pursuing business plans, when the only plan from the onset was to have these Companies 
sold as public vehicles.  As part of the scheme, Lamson recruited sole officers, acted as a 
sole officer in at least one of the Blank Check Companies, and performed bookkeeping 
work for the Black Check Companies, including the drafting of their financial statements.   
 
               C.     On April 16, 2015, the Commission filed a complaint against 
Lamson and five other Defendants in SEC v. Jeffrey L. Lamson, et al., Case No. 9:15-cv-
80496 (S.D. Fla. 2015).  On June 22, 2015, the Court entered an order permanently 
enjoining Lamson, by consent, from future violations of Section 13(b)(5) and Rules 13a-14, 
13a-15, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), 15 
U.S.C. § 78m(b)(5), and 17 C.F.R. §§ 240.13a-14, 240.13a-15, 240.13b2-1, 240.13b2-2; 
and aiding and abetting violations of Section 17(a) and Rule 302 of Regulation S-T of the 
Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”), 15 U.S.C. § 77q(a) and 17 C.F.R. § 232.302, and 
Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) and Rules 10b-5, 12b-11, 12b-20, 13a-1, 
13a-13, 13a-14, 13a-15, 13b2-1 of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b), 78m(a), 
78m(b)(2)(A), 78m(b)(2)(B), and 17 C.F.R. §§ 240.10b-5, 240.12b-11, 240.12b-20, 
240.13a-1, 240.13a-13, 240.13a-14, 240.13a-15, 240.13b2-1.  The Court also imposed 
permanent officer and director and penny stock bars upon Lamson.  Further, Lamson was 

                                           -2 -

also ordered to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and a civil 
money penalty with the amounts to be determined at a later date upon the Commission’s 
motion. 
 
              D.     The  Commission’s  complaint  alleged,  among  other  things,  that 
Lamson  and the other  Defendants  participated  in a scheme to manufacture at least 22 
undisclosed Blank Check Companies as defined in Rule 419 under the Securities Act, 17 
C.F.R. § 230.419, using other Defendants as sole officers for some of these entities.  The 
Defendants subsequently sold 18 of the Blank Check Companies by reverse merger or 
other  change-of-control  transactions  for  approximately  $6  million.     The  Defendants 
developed a fine-tuned assembly line rife with fraud at each stage.  Each of the Defendants 
recruited on behalf of a Blank Check Company a sole officer, director, employee, and 
majority shareholder (the “sole officer”) to act in name only.  The Defendants prepared a 
variety of corporate documents, including board resolutions for the invalid issuance of 
shares that were then the subject of false and misleading registration statements.  These 
registration statements and subsequent filings with the Commission falsely depicted the 
Blank Check Companies as actively pursuing business plans, when the Defendants’ only 
plan from the outset was for the companies to be sold as public vehicles.  Lamson and other 
Defendants  were  sole  officers  who  knew  that  at  least  their  respective  Blank  Check 
Companies had no active business plan other than to be sold as public vehicles, and took a 
variety  of  actions  in  furtherance  of  the  Defendants’  scheme.   In  particular,  Lamson 
performed bookkeeping work for the Black Check Companies, including the drafting of 
their financial statements. 
 
                                           IV. 
                                             
       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public 
interest to impose the sanction agreed to in Respondent Lamson’s Offer. 
 
       Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that: 
 
       Lamson is suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an 
accountant.   
 
       By the Commission.
