                                            I. 
 
      The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) deems it appropriate and in the 
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against David 
M. Martin (Respondent or Martin) pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(i) of the Commissions Rules of 
Practice.1

                                               II. 
 
       In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the Offer) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the 
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings 
herein, except as to the Commissions jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these 
proceedings, and the findings contained in Section III.3  below, which are admitted, Respondent 
consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Rule 102(e) 
of the Commissions Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions 
(Order), as set forth below.   
 
                                              III. 
 
       On the basis of this Order and Respondents Offer, the Commission finds that: 
 
              1.      David M. Martin, age 5 5, is and has been a certified public accountant 
licensed to practice in the State of Texas.  He served as Chief Financial Officer of Life Partners 
Holdings, Inc. (LHPI) between February 2008 and July 2012. 
        
              2.      LPHI was, at all relevant times, a Texas corporation with its principal place 
of business in Waco, Texas.  LPHI  is engaged in facilitating the purchase and sale of fractional 
interests of life insurance policies in the secondary market known as life settlements.  At all 
relevant times, LPHIs common stock was registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 
12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and traded on the NASDAQ 
National Market. 
 
              3.      On January 9, 2014, a final judgment was entered against Respondent , 
permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and 
Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder, and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 
13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder, 
in the civil action entitled Securities and Exchange Commission v. Life Partners Holdings, Inc., et 
al., Civil Action Number 1:12-CV-33-JRN in the United States District Court for the Western 
District of Texas.  Respondent  was ordered to pay a civil penalty of $34,961. 
  
                                              IV. 
                                                 
       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
impose the sanction agreed to in Respondent Martins Offer. 
 
       Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that: 
 
       A.     Martin is suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an 
accountant.  After three years from the date of this order, Respondent may request that the 

                                               2

Commission consider his reinstatement by submitting an application (attention: Office of the Chief 
Accountant) to resume appearing or practicing before the Commission as: 
      
               1.     a preparer or reviewer, or a person responsible for the preparation or 
review, of any public companys financial statements that are filed with the Commission.  Such 
an application must satisfy the Commission that Respondents work in his practice before the 
Commission will be reviewed either by the independent audit committee of the public company 
for which he works or in some other acceptable manner, as long as he practices before the 
Commission in this capacity; and/or 
      
               2.     an independent accountant.  Such an application must satisfy the 
Commission that: 
      
                      (a)     Respondent, or the public accounting firm with which he/she is 
associated, is registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (Board) in 
accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and such registration continues to be effective; 
 
                      (b)     Respondent, or the registered public accounting firm with which 
he/she is associated, has been inspected by the Board and that inspection did not identify any 
criticisms of or potential defects in the respondents or the firms quality control system that 
would indicate that the respondent will not receive appropriate supervision; 

                      (c)     Respondent has resolved all disciplinary issues with the Board, and 
has complied with all terms and conditions of any sanctions imposed by the Board (other than 
reinstatement by the Commission); and 
 
                      (d)     Respondent acknowledges his/her responsibility, as long as 
Respondent appears or practices before the Commission as an independent accountant, to 
comply with all requirements of the Commission and the Board, including, but not limited to, all 
requirements relating to registration, inspections, concurring partner reviews and quality control 
standards.   
      
       B.      The Commission will consider an application by Respondent to resume 
appearing or practicing before the Commission provided that his state CPA license is 
current and he has resolved all other disciplinary issues with the applicable state boards of 
accountancy.  However, if state licensure is dependent on reinstatement by the 
Commission, the Commission will consider an application on its other merits.  The 
Commissions review may include consideration of, in addition to the matters referenced 
above, any other matters relating to Respondents character, integrity, professional conduct, 
or qualifications to appear or practice before the Commission. 
 
       By the Commission.
