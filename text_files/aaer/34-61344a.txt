APPLIED WELLNESS CORPORATION               :      REGISTRATION BY DEFAULT

___________________________________ 
 
       The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) initiated this proceeding on 
December 10, 2009, with an Order Instituting Proceedings (OIP), pursuant to Section 12(j) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act)  .  The OIP alleges that Respondent Applied 
Wellness Corporation (Applied Wellness), is a co rporation with common stock registered with 
the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the  Exchange Act, which has repeatedly failed to 
file required periodic reports. 
 
       The Division of Enforcement has provided  evidence that Applied Wellness was served   
with the OIP in a manner that complies with  17 C.F.R. § 141(a)(2)(ii) by December 18, 2009.   
Applied Wellness’ Answer was due twenty days   from the date of service and no Answer has 
been received.  See 17 C.F.R. § 201.220(b); OIP at 2.  Applied Wellness was put on notice, by                           
Order dated January 5, 2010, that failure to file an Answer could result in default.  Thus, Applied 
Wellness has failed to answer or otherwise de  fend the proceeding within the meaning of 17 
C.F.R. § 201.155(a)(2).   Accordingly, Applied    Wellness is in default, and the following 
allegations in the OIP are deemed to be true.  See 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), .220(f); OIP at 2-3. 
 
       Applied Wellness, CIK No. 0001134011, is a Neva da corporation located in San Diego, 
California.   Pursuant to its  Form 10-KSB filed on April 15,  2008, it purported to distribute 
“devices for non-invasive therapeutic applications  based on the latest adva nces in the field of 
ionic therapies” through its s ubsidiary, Energy Balance Resources , Inc.  The common stock of 
Applied Wellness has been regi stered with the Commission unde r Exchange Act Section 12(g) 
since April 8, 2001.  Applied Wellness common stock (symbol AWLL)      1
                                                                         is quoted on the Pink

 The OIP lists the common stock symbol of Applied Wellness as AAWL.  However, Applied 
Wellness’ common stock symbol is AWLL.  All ot her references to Applied Wellness set forth 
---------------------Page 2---------------------

Sheets, operated by Pink OTC Markets Inc., and is eligible for the “piggyback” exception of          
Rule 15c2-11 of the Exchange Act. 
 
       While its common stock was registered with the Commission, Applied Wellness failed to 
comply with Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rule s 13a-1 and 13a-15 thereunder in that it failed 
to make disclosures in its Form 10-KSB for th e fiscal year ended December 31, 2007, filed with 
the Commission on April 15, 2008, concerning its inte rnal control over financial reporting and 
disclosure controls and procedures, as required by Items 307 and 308T of Regulation S-B.   
 
       While its common stock was registered with the Commission, Applied Wellness failed to 
comply with Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Ru les 13a-1 and 13a-13 ther eunder in that it has  
failed to file periodic or quarterly reports on Fo rm 10-Q since its fiscal quarter ended March 31, 
2008, and failed to file an annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal year ended December 31, 2008.  
 
       Exchange Act Section 13(a) and the rules        promulgated thereunder require issuers of 
securities registered pursuant to Exchange Act  Section 12 to file with the Commission current 
and accurate information in periodic reports, even if the registration is voluntary under Section    
12(g).   Specifically, Exchange Act Rule 13a-     1 requires issuers to fi  le annual reports and 
Exchange Act Rule 13a-13 requires issuers to file  quarterly reports.  Exchange Act Rule 13a-15 
requires issuers, with limited exceptions, to maintain disclosure controls and procedures, and, if   
such an issuer either had been required to file an annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) 
of the Exchange Act for the prior fiscal year or  had filed an annual repo rt with the Commission 
for the prior fiscal year, internal control over financial reporting. 
 
       As a result of the conduct described above, A pplied Wellness has failed to comply with 
Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1, 13a-13, and 13a-15 thereunder.  Considering  
its delinquencies, it is necessary  and appropriate for the protec tion of investors to revoke the 
registration of each class of registered securities of Applied Wellness. 
        
       IT IS ORDERED THAT, pursuant to Section   12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934, the registration of each class  of registered securities of  Applied Wellness Corporation, is 
revoked.

Wellness within the Commission’s EDGAR database.
