       In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondents have submitted an Offer

       On the basis of this Order and Respondents’ Offer, the Commission finds3
                                                                                that: 

A.     RESPONDENTS 

       1.       Darilek, Butler & Co., P.C. (the “Firm”) is a Texas professional corporation and a 
public accounting firm headquartered in San Antonio, Texas.  The Firm audited Health Discovery 
Corporation’s (“HDC”) financial statements for the company’s 2003 fiscal year ended December 
31, 2003. 

       2.       Robert F. Darilek, CPA, (“Darilek”), 52, of San Antonio, Texas, is a certified 
public accountant licensed in the state of Texas.  Darilek was the engagement partner in connection 
with the Firm’s audit of HDC’s financial statements for the company’s 2003 fiscal year ended 
December 31, 2003.  Darilek has been licensed as a CPA in Texas since 1982. 

B.     FACTS 

       1.     HDC is a Georgia corporation with its headquarters in Savannah, Georgia.  HDC’s 
common stock is registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act 
and is traded on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol HDVY.  For its fiscal year ended 
December 31, 2003, HDC reported revenues of $50 and total assets of $941,000. 

       2.     HDC has at all relevant times been an issuer as defined by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
of 2002 (the “Act”). 

       3.     The Firm audited HDC’s 2003 financial statements included in HDC’s annual 
report for fiscal year 2003 on Form 10-KSB, filed with the Commission on March 30, 2004.  As 
part of that audit, the Firm prepared and issued an audit report dated February 27, 2004 (the “HDC 
audit report”), which the company included in its 2003 Form 10-KSB.  HDC paid the Firm

       The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondents’ Offer of Settlement and are not binding on any 
other person or entity in this or any other proceeding. 

                                               2

$10,000 for the audit work.  4 

        4.      At the time the Firm issued the HDC audit report, it was not registered with the 
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the “Board”), as required by Section 102(a) of the 
Act. 

        5.      Darilek was the engagement partner on the Firm’s audit of HDC’s 2003 financial 
statements.  Darilek participated in the preparation and issuance of the HDC audit report. 

C.      VIOLATIONS 

        1.      Section 102(a) of the Act provides that “it shall be unlawful for any person that is 
not a registered public accounting firm to prepare or issue, or to participate in the preparation or 
issuance of, any audit report with respect to any issuer.” 5 

        2.      The provisions of Section 102(a) of the Act became effective on October 22, 2003.       6 

        3.      Based on the conduct described above, the Firm willfully     7
                                                                               violated Section 102(a) 
of the Act. 

        4.      Based on the conduct described above, Darilek caused the Firm’s violation of 
Section 102(a) of the Act. 

D. FINDI       NGS 

        Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that the Firm willfully violated Section 
102(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and that Darilek caused the Firm’s violation of Section 
102(a) of the Act. 

4 
        During the course of the Commission’s investigation, the Firm voluntarily reimbursed HDC the $10,000 in 
audit fees through the provision of non-audit or other services to the issuer.  In view of the Firm’s reimbursement, 
the Commission is not ordering disgorgement in this matter. 
5 
        A violation of the Act or any rule that the Board issues under the Act is treated for all purposes in the same 
manner as a violation of the Exchange Act, including with respect to penalties.  Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 15 
U.S.C.A. § 7202(b)(1) (West 2002). 
6 
        Section 102(a) became effective “[b]eginning 180 days after the date of the determination of the 
Commission under Section 101(d)” of the Act that the Board was prepared to undertake its statutory responsibilities.  
The Commission made the required determination on April 25, 2003.  See Order Regarding Section 101(d) of the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Securities Act Release No. 8223, Exchange Act Release No. 47746, 2003 WL 
1956164  (Apr. 25, 2003). 
7 
        “Willfully” as used in this Order means intentionally committing the act that constitutes the violation. 
There is no requirement that the actor also be aware that he is violating a rule or statute.  See Wonsover v. SEC, 205 
F.3d 408, 414 (D.C. Cir. 2000); Tager v. SEC, 344 F.2d 5, 8 (2d Cir. 1965).
