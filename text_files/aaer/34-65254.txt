                                              II.  
 
       In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the 
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings 
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these 
proceedings, and the findings contained in Section III.C. below, which are admitted, Respondent 
consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Rule 102(e) 
of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions 
(“Order”), as set forth below.   
 
                                              III.  
 
       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that:  
 
       A.     Vrbas served as chief financial officer of Brooke Corporation (“Brooke”) from  
March 10, 2008 until October 30, 2008, and as chief financial officer of Brooke Capital Corp. 
(“Brooke Capital”) from August 15, 2008 until October 30, 2008.  Prior to August 15, 2008, Vrbas  
was the primary accountant in charge of preparing Brooke Capital’s financial statements. 
        
       B.     Brooke was, at all relevant times, a Kansas corporation with its principal place of  
business in Overland Park, Kansas.  Brooke was a provider of banking, insurance, and other  
financial services.  At all relevant times, Brooke’s common stock was registered with the  
Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), 
and traded on the NASDAQ Global Market.  Brooke Capital was, at all relevant times, a Kansas 
corporation with its principal place of business in  Overland Park, Kansas.  Brooke Capital operated 
a franchise network of insurance agents.  At all relevant times, Brooke Capital’s common stock was 
registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, and traded on the 
American Stock Exchange. 
 
       C.     On July 13, 2011, a final judgment was entered against Vrbas, permanently 
enjoining him from future violations of Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 
1933 (“Securities Act”), Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 
and 13b2-1 thereunder, and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 
13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder, in the civil 
action entitled Securities and Exchange Commission v. Travis W. Vrbas, Case No. 11-CV-2251 
WEB/KGG, in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas.  Vrbas was also ordered 
to pay a $130,000 civil money penalty. 
 
       D.     The Commission’s complaint alleged, among other things, that Vrbas was 
responsible for Brooke filing materially false and misleading financial statements in the company’s 
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007, and in the company’s Forms 10-Q for the 
period ended March 31, 2008, the period ended June 30, 2008 and Amended 2008 Form 10-Q for  
that period, and Form S-3 filed May 28, 2008, and for Brooke Capital filing materially false and 

                                               2

misleading financial statements in the company’s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December  
31, 2007, and in the company’s Forms 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2008 and June 30, 
2008.   The Complaint alleged th at Vrbas knew that Brooke Capital had improperly recognized 
loan fee revenue on unfunded loans in a departure from generally accepted accounting principles 
(“GAAP”), which materially misstated the net income of Brooke and Brooke Capital.     
        
       E.     In addition, the Complaint alleged that Vrbas made certifications of Brooke’s  
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007, and in the company’s Forms 10-Q for the 
period ended March 31, 2008, the period ended June 30, 2008 and Amended 2008 Form 10-Q for  
that period, and Brooke Capital’s Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2008, which contained 
untrue statements of material fact, and omitted material facts necessary to make the statements 
made therein, in light of the circumstances under which the statements were made, not misleading.   
        
       F.     In addition, the Complaint alleged that Vrbas reviewed and signed Brooke’s Form  
10-K for the period ended December 31, 2007, Forms 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2008, 
the period ended June 30, 2008 and Amended 2008 Form  10-Q for that period, and Form S-3 filed 
May 28, 2008, and Brooke Capital’s Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2008, which 
contained material misrepresentations and omitted material facts. Those misrepresentations and 
omissions included, among other things: 
        
              1.	   the extent to which franchise location numbers and growth included abandoned 
                  and failed locations;  
                   
              2.	   the nature and extent of Brooke Capital’s financial assistance to franchisees,  
                  including, the number of franchisees receiving financial assistance, the long-
                  term and recurring nature of such financial assistance to some franchisees, the 
                  dependence of some franchisees on such financial assistance to continue 
                  operations, and Brooke Capital’s payment of principal and interest on some 
                  franchisee loans to Aleritas; and  
        
              3.	   the extent to which Brooke and Brooke Capital were profitable, liquid, and able 
                  to cash flow. 
        
       G.     In addition, the Complaint alleged that Vrbas failed to make and keep accurate  
books and records of Brooke and Brooke Capital with regards to the misstatements of their 
financial statements. 
        
       H.     In addition, the Complaint alleged that Vrbas failed to devise and maintain a system 
of internal accounting controls sufficient to prevent, detect and correct the misstatements of the 
financial statements of Brooke and Brooke Capital.

             In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
impose the sanction agreed to in Respondent Vrbas’ Offer. 
 
             Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that:  
 
             Vrbas is suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant.
