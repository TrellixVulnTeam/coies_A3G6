       1.     During the relevant period, Silver Bow Antique Aviation (“Silver Bow”), Animal 
Cloning Sciences, Inc. (“Animal Cloning”), Knickerbocker Capital Corporation 
(“Knickerbocker”), Asian Financial, Inc. (“Asian Financial”), Apex Capital Group, Inc. (“Apex 
Capital”), and Woodstock Tree Farms, Inc. (“Woodstock”), were all under common control and 
ownership, and the common stock of Silver Bow, Animal Cloning, Knickerbocker, Asian 
Financial, and Apex Capital was registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the 
Exchange Act.  None of the companies reported revenue for 2003.  Silver Bow reported $37,675 in 
total assets for December 31, 2003, and Woodstock reported $282,593 in total assets for December 
31, 2003. 

       2.     Silver Bow, Animal Cloning, Knickerbocker, Asian Financial, Apex Capital, and 
Woodstock have at all relevant times each been an issuer as defined by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 
2002 (the “Act”). 

       3.     The Firm audited Silver Bow’s 2002 financial statements included in Silver Bow’s 
annual report for fiscal year 2002 on Form 10-KSB, filed with the Commission on May 20, 2004.  
As part of the audit, the Firm prepared and issued an audit report dated November 30, 2003, which 
the company included in its 2002 Form 10-KSB.  The Firm also audited Silver Bow’s 2003 
financial statements included in Silver Bow’s annual report for fiscal year 2003 on Form 10-KSB, 
filed with the Commission on May 21, 2004, and in Silver Bow’s registration statement on Form 
SB-2/A, filed with the Commission on May 25, 2004.  As part of the audit, the Firm prepared and 
issued an audit report dated May 3, 2004 (together with the November 30, 2003 audit report, the 
“Silver Bow audit reports”), which the company included in its 2003 Form 10-KSB and in its 
registration statement on Form SB-2/A. 

       4.     The Firm audited Animal Cloning’s 2003 financial statements included in Animal 
Cloning’s annual report for fiscal year 2003 on Form 10-KSB, filed with the Commission on 
February 13, 2004.  As part of that audit, the Firm prepared and issued an audit report dated 
February 9, 2004 (the “Animal Cloning audit report”), which the company included in its 2003 
Form 10-KSB. 

       5.     Animal Cloning retained a new, registered firm to audit its financial statements for 
fiscal year 2004. However, because of a reclassification regarding a note payable, the company 
restated its financial statements for fiscal year 2003.  As a result, because the Firm had originally 
audited Animal Clonings’ financial statements for fiscal year 2003, it issued an updated audit 
report on October 28, 2005, explaining the reclassification.  Animal Cloning included the new 
audit report in a Form 10-KSB filed with the Commission on December 12, 2005.  The Firm 
issued the October 28, 2005 audit report after the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
(the “Board”) had disapproved the Firm’s application for registration.  See paragraph 13 below. 

       6.     The Firm audited Knickerbocker’s 2003 financial statements included in 
Knickerbocker’s annual report for fiscal year 2003 on Form 10-KSB, filed with the Commission 
on March 30, 2004.  As part of that audit, the Firm prepared and issued an audit report dated March 
23, 2004 (the “Knickerbocker audit report”), which the company included in its 2003 Form 10-
KSB.  On May 3, 2004, Knickerbocker dismissed the firm as its independent auditor. 

                                              3

       7.     The Firm audited Asian Financial’s 2003 financial statements included in Asian 
Financial’s annual report for fiscal year 2003 on Form 10-KSB, filed with the Commission on 
April 6, 2004. As part of that audit, the Firm prepared and issued an audit report dated March 26, 
2004 (the “Asian Financial audit report”), which the company included in its 2003 Form 10-KSB. 

       8.     The Firm audited Apex Capital’s 2003 financial statements included in Apex 
Capital’s annual report for fiscal year 2003 on Form 10-KSB, filed with the Commission on April 
6, 2004. As part of that audit, the Firm prepared and issued an audit report dated March 27, 2004 
(the “Apex Capital audit report”), which the company included in its 2003 Form 10-KSB. 

       9.     The Firm audited Woodstock’s 2002 and 2003 financial statements, which were 
included in Woodstock’s registration statement on Form SB-2/A, filed with the Commission on 
June 14, 2004. As part of that audit, the Firm prepared and issued an audit report dated April 29, 
2004 (the “Woodstock audit report”), which the company included in its Form SB-2/A.   

       10.    The Firm collected no fees for the audit work performed for Silver Bow, Animal 
Cloning, Knickerbocker, Asian Financial, Apex Capital, and Woodstock.   

       11.    At the time the Firm issued the Silver Bow, Animal Cloning, Knickerbocker, Asian 
Financial, Apex Capital, and Woodstock audit reports, it was not registered with the Board as 
required by Section 102(a) of the Act. 

       12.    Winings was the engagement partner on the Firm’s audit of the financial statements 
of Silver Bow, Animal Cloning, Knickerbocker, Asian Financial, Apex Capital, and Woodstock.  
Winings participated in the preparation and issuance of the Silver Bow, Animal Cloning, 
Knickerbocker, Asian Financial, Apex Capital, and Woodstock audit reports. 

       13.    By order dated April 18, 2005, the Board disapproved an application for 
registration submitted by the Firm based in part on the Firm’s violation of Section 102(a) of the 
Act in issuing the Silver Bow, Animal Cloning, Knickerbocker, Asian Financial, Apex Capital, and 
Woodstock audit reports.4
                           The order effectively prevented the Firm from becoming registered with 
the Board until after February 15, 2006, approximately 15 months from the date the Board issued a 
notice of hearing on the Firm’s application.5
                                            Winings has only worked as an accountant through 
the Firm since before the Board’s order and has not otherwise been associated with a public 

4 
       PCAOB Release No. 2005-005 (Apr. 18, 2005).  The order also found that the Firm’s 
issuance of the Silver Bow, Animal Cloning, Knickerbocker, Asian Financial, Apex Capital, and 
Woodstock audit reports violated Board Rule 2100, which implemented Section 102(a) of the Act, 
and that the Firm violated Board Rule 2101 when it failed to identify and to provide required 
information concerning the Knickerbocker audit report on the Firm’s registration application.  Id. 
5 
       The order states that with respect to any new registration application the Firm submits 
after February 15, 2006, the Board will not issue a notice of hearing to determine whether to 
approve or disapprove such application based solely on the violations subject to the Board’s 
order.  Id. 

                                               4

accounting firm registered with the Board. 

C.     VIOLATIONS 

       1.     Section 102(a) of the Act provides that “it shall be unlawful for any person that is 
not a registered public accounting firm to prepare or issue, or to participate in the preparation or 
issuance of, any audit report with respect to any issuer.”6 

       2.     The provisions of Section 102(a) of the Act became effective on October 22, 2003.7 

       3.     Based on the conduct described above, the Firm willfully8
                                                                        violated Section 102(a) 
of the Act. 

       4.     Based on the conduct described above, Winings caused the Firm’s violation of 
Section 102(a) of the Act. 

D. FINDI      NGS 

       Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that the Firm willfully violated Section 
102(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and that Winings caused the Firm’s violation of Section 
102(a) of the Act. 

E.     UNDERTAKING 

       Respondents undertake not to request, demand, or accept, directly or indirectly, any 
compensation from Silver Bow, Animal Cloning, Knickerbocker, Asian Financial, Apex Capital, 
and Woodstock in connection with the audit work associated with the respective audit reports.  In 
determining whether to accept the Offer, the Commission has considered this undertaking. 

6 
       A violation of the Act or any rule that the Board issues under the Act is treated for all 
purposes in the same manner as a violation of the Exchange Act, including with respect to 
penalties.  Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 15 U.S.C.A. § 7202(b)(1) (West 2002). 
7 
       Section 102(a) became effective “[b]eginning 180 days after the date of the determination 
of the Commission under Section 101(d)” of the Act that the Board was prepared to undertake its 
statutory responsibilities.  The Commission made the required determination on April 25, 2003.  
See Order Regarding Section 101(d) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Securities Act Release 
No. 8223, Exchange Act Release No. 47746, 2003 WL 1956164  (Apr. 25, 2003). 
8 
       “Willfully” as used in this Offer means intentionally committing the act that constitutes 
the violation.  There is no requirement that the actor also be aware that he is violating a rule or 
statute.  See Wonsover v. SEC, 205 F.3d 408, 414 (D.C. Cir. 2000); Tager v. SEC, 344 F.2d 5, 8 
(2d Cir. 1965).

                                              IV.

agreed to in Respondents’ Offer. 

       Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that:

                      2.     It has submitted to the Commission staff (attention: Office of the

              A.      Winings shall cease and desist from committing or causing any violations

              B.      Winings may practice before the Commission as an independent accountant 
provided that: 

                      1.     The public accounting firm with which he is associated is registered 
with the Board in accordance with the Act, and such registration continues to be effective; and 

                                               6
