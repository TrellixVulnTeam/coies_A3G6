Respondent.                                     
                                                
 
 
 
                                            I. 
 
      The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the 
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to 
Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”) against George Joseph 
Palathinkal (“Respondent”). 
                                            II. 
 
      In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of  Settlement  (the  “Offer”)  which  the  Commission  has  determined  to  accept.    Solely  for  the 
purpose  of  these  proceedings  and  any  other  proceedings  brought  by  or  on  behalf  of  the 
Commission,  or  to  which  the  Commission  is  a  party,  Respondent  admits  the  Commission’s 
jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these proceedings, and the findings contained in 
Sections III.2 below, and consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings 
Pursuant to Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Making Findings, and Imposing 
Remedial Sanctions (“Order”), as set forth below.

                                                III. 
 
       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that  
 
       1.      Palathinkal, 53 years old, is a citizen of Singapore.  Palathinkal was, from March 1, 
2013 through approximately June 1, 2014, a General Partner, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief 
Compliance Officer of Aphelion Fund Management, LLC (“Aphelion”), an unregistered investment 
adviser.  
        
       2.      On March 13, 2015, Palathinkal pled guilty to one count of perjury in violation of 
Title 18 United States Code, Section 1621 before the United States District Court for the District of 
Columbia, in United States v. George Palathinkal, Crim. Information No. 1:15-cr-00024-RMC. 
 
       3.      The criminal information to which Palathinkal pled guilty alleged that in March 
2014, he took an oath that he would testify truthfully in investigative testimony before the 
Commission, and that during such testimony, he gave false testimony that earlier versions or drafts 
of a certain promissory note between Palathinkal and Aphelion existed, when in fact there were no 
earlier versions or drafts.  In May 2014, the Commission filed a lawsuit against Palathinkal and 
others.  In July and August 2014, Palathinkal voluntarily met with Commission attorneys and 
acknowledged the false testimony he had previously provided. 
        
                                                IV. 
                                                  
        In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
impose the sanctions agreed to in Respondent Palathinkal’s Offer. 
 
        Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED pursuant to Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act, that 
Respondent Palathinkal be, and hereby is barred from association with any broker, dealer, 
investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally 
recognized statistical rating organization. 
 
       By the Commission.
