                                 Plaintiff,                08CV      (  ) 

INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. and             : 
MCCANN-ERICKSON WORLDWIDE, INC.                            COMPLAINT 

                                 Defendants. 

      Plaintiff, Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"), alleges the 

following against defendants Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. ("IPG") and McCann- 

Erickson Worldwide, Inc. ("McCann") (collectively, the "Defendants"): 

                                     SUMMARY 

      1.     This enforcement action primarily involves securities fraud at McCann, IPG7s 

largest subsidiary. 

      2.          IPG is a holding company that owns numerous advertising, marketing and 

associated companies, including the advertising agency, McCann, which, in turn, owns hundreds 

of regional and local operating agencies throughout the world. 
---------------------Page 2---------------------

        3.     From August 2002 through September 2005, PG  issued numerous restatements 

that together totaled more than $600 million.  The restatements corrected misstatements in PG's 

financial statements that emanated from numerous substantive areas in a variety of geographic 

regions, and reflected conduct ranging from inaccurate books and records and lack of internal 

controls to fraud. 

       4.      Initially, in the Fall of 2002, PG  restated its financial results in an amount of 

$18 1 million for the period 1997 to 2002.  The largest component of this restatement 

(approximately $101 million) was attributable generally to the fact that McCann failed to 

expense intercompany charges. 

       5.      Specifically, McCann's financial management, including McCannYs Vice- 

Chairman, Finance and Operations and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), and the Chief 

Operating Officer ("COO") of the Europe-Middle East-Ahca  region ("EMEA"), failed to ensure 

McCann reconciled its intercompany accounts for at least six years. At times, McCann's 

finnilcjal management ;7ui;;osely delayed reconciling intercompany accounts because tiley imeti; 

a reconciliation would result in write-offs that would interfere with McCann's efforts to hit profit 

targets. Because McCann never fully reconciled its intercompany accounts and failed to expense 

properly intercompany charges, McCannYs financial results were inaccurate. (By 2002, 

McCann's intercompany accounts were misstated by approximately $101 million.) As 

McCann's financial management knew, PG  then incorporated McCann7s misstated financial 

results in PG's  consolidated financial statements. 

       6.     PG's  financial management negligently ignored indications McCann was 

improperly accounting for intercompany transactions. Accordingly, IPG negligently ignored the 
---------------------Page 3---------------------

risk that McCann's results were materially misstated, with the result that IPG's own financial 

results were materially misstated. 

        7.     PG's  financial reporting problems were not resolved in 2002.  In September 

2005, PG  again restated its pre-tax income for the years 2000 through 2003, and the nine 

months ended 2004, in the amount of $420 million. A large portion of this restatement was 

related to $199 million of improperly recognized revenue related to Agency Volume 

Bonifications ("AVBs") and other vendor discounts and credits that PG  took in violation of its 

contracts with certain of its clients. The remaining restated items stemmed from a variety of 

issues, including improperly recording revenues from businesses PG  had acquired prior to the 

closing date of those transactions, and improperly accounting for payments to owners of former 

businesses as goodwill instead of as a compensation cost. 

       8.      The 2005 restatement was necessary because  there had been a substantial 

breakdown of internal controls at IPG, and its numerous subsidiaries, including McCann. 

       9.     IPG  filed ntmerous Forms  12-I(, Forms 10-Q, Forms  8-X, 3:id registmiion 

statements that contained misrepresentations due to the intercompany issues, the AVB issues, 

and the various other issues that were reflected in the 2002 and 2005 restatements. For example, 

in its 2002 Form 10-K, PG  reported net income of $99.5 million. This figure, however, was 

improperly inflated by $82.8 million, and IPG's actual income, as reflected in the restatements, 

was only $16.7 million (a 496% overstatement). 

       10.    Through this conduct, PGviolated  Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act 

of 1933 ("Securities Act"), 15 U.S.C. $9 77q(a)(2) and (3), and Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) 

and (B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act"), 15 U.S.C. $5 78m(a) and 
---------------------Page 4---------------------

              78m(b)(2)(A) and  (B), and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder, 17 C.F.R. 

              $8240. 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13. 

                     1 1.   Through ths  conduct, McCm  violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, 15 

              U.S.C. 5 77q(a), and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. $ 78j(b), and Rule lob-5 
i 
              thereunder, 17 C.F.R. $240.10b-5, and aided and abetted IPG's violations of Sections 13(a) and 

              13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. $5 78m(a) and 78m(b)(2)(A) and  (B), and 

             Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13, 17 C.F.R. $8 240.12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13. 
I

                     12.       The Commission brings this action pursuant to authority conferred by Section 

             20(b) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. $ 77t(b), and Section 21(d)(l) of the Exchange Act, 15 

             U.S.C.  5 78u(d)(l).  The Commission is seeking permanent injunctive relief fiom IPG and 

             McCann. The Commission also seeks disgorgement from IPG and McCann. The Commission 

             seeks civil penalties pursuant to Section 2Q(d) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. 3 77t(d), and 

             Sscticn 2i(d)(3) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. $ 78u(d)(3), a~air,st McCann. Finally, the 

             Commission seeks all other just and appropriate relief. 

                    13.       This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 

             22(a) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. $ 77v(a), and Section 27 of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. $ 

                    14.    Venue lies in this court pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. 

             5 77v(a), and Section 27 of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 5 78aa.  Certain of the transactions, 

             acts, practices and courses of business occurred within the Southern District of New York.  For 

             example, IPG's and McCannYs headquarters are located in New York, New York.

        15.    LPG and McCann, directly and indirectly, singly and in concert, made use of the 

 means or instruments of transportation or communication in, and the means or instrumentalities 

 of, interstate commerce, or of the mails, in connection with the transactions, acts, practices, and

                                   THE DEFENDANTS 

        16.    IPG is an advertising and media holding company that owns over 600 advertising 

agencies and other companies in approximately 130 countries. IPG is headquartered in New 

York, New York, and its stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. 

       17.    McCann    is a Delaware corporation that PG  wholly owns.  McCann maintains its 

headquarters in New York.  McCann's revenues during the relevant period constituted 

approximately one-third to over one-half of PGYs revenues. McCann' is organized into regional 

groups: North America, EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin America.  In terms of number of 

operating agencies, EMEA was McCannYs largest region with 193 operating agencies in 40 

c~untries. McCara  g?-txv dran:atically between 1996 and 2001, ix~cluding acquiri:?g O-S~C: 100 

companies.  McCann Advertising, Ltd. ("MEA),  McCannYs advertising agency in London, was 

one of EMEA7s largest agencies.

                                           FACTS 

                                         Background 

IPG's  Corporate Culture 

        19.    PG  and McCann had a deep-rooted culture that emphasized profits as the 

company's prime objective. 

       20.    MEA's Finance Director from 1997 through early 2000 described the drive to 

deliver profits as very aggressive. 

       21.    Every year from 1997 through 2001, PwC   UK   listed "pressure from parent 

company to produce results in line with budget7' as one of several risk assessments at MEA, 

McCann's advertising agency in London, in PwC's internal audit strategy memorandum. 

       22.    Every fall, McCann conducted "Forward Planning Meetings."  At these meetings, 

McCann management met with regional management and local heads of agencies and proposed 

budgets acd profit targets for the fallowing year.  McCalm management then either accepted or 

rejected the budget. If rejected, the agencies had to return with a higher number to attain.  After 

McCann management accepted the budget for all of its agencies, McCann management then 

submitted the budget on a consolidated basis to IPG management, who then either accepted or 

rejected it. 

       23.        This planning process was updated twice throughout the year -- in the Spring and 

Summer  -- based on actual profits achieved by the agencies and any other developments. During 

the updating process, new profit targets were set, often above the original target set in the 

Forward Planning Meeting.  Consequently, these targets were called "stretch targets." 

                                              6 
---------------------Page 7---------------------

        24.    IPG also had a process of setting budgets and profit targets for its operating 

agencies, such as McCann. 

        25.    Every Fall, management of each operating agency, including McCann, would 

submit its proposed consolidated budget and profit target to IPG. IPG management would then 

either accept the proposed budget or reject it.  This process was updated twice throughout the 

year. 

       26.     IPG, too, insisted on aggressive profit targets. Failure to meet profit targets could 

result in lower bonuses for officers and employees, and potentially termination. 

       27.     IPG's and McCann's focus on profits, and lack of adequate attention to balance 

sheet issues, as well as their inadequate internal controls and books and records, contributed to 

IPG's and McCann's intercompany problems, as well as a myriad of other financial reporting 

problems. 

                   The 2002 Restatements    - The Intercompany Problems 

fnterc9;nany  Transactions 

       28.        McCann utilized intercompany accounts to record and account for activity 

conducted between its hundreds of agencies. 

       29.    When handled properly, intercompany transactions would be booked through a 

corresponding entry by each side of a given transaction, and would have no impact on McCann's 

consolidated assets, liabilities, expenses or revenues. 

       30.    Imbalances occurred, however, for a variety of reasons, including instances where 

there was a delay in processing of the invoice, or the McCann agency being charged (or its 

client) disputed the amount of the charge. 
---------------------Page 8---------------------

       3 1.   In some cases, rather than record an expense, local agencies placed offsetting 

debits designated as "in dispute" or "in transit" in various suspense accounts on the balance 

sheets, including an account called "AR-Other" (typically, these accounts were non- 

intercompany accounts). If the relevant McCann agencies could not then resolve the discrepancy 

or disputes in intercompany accounts, McCann should have written the amounts off in a 

reasonable period of time. 

       32.    IPGYs Standard Policies & Procedures ("SP&P9') included a provision for 

intercompany transactions that applied to all operating agencies, including McCann agencies. 

The policy required that an intercompany invoice be issued for all amounts exceeding $250 and 

be recorded by the receiving agency in the month received whether or not the invoice was 

disputed. According to the SP&P, the Controller's office was responsible for resolving disputes 

that the financial or operational staff of the relevant agencies could not. 

       33.    McCann also required agencies to complete Schedules A and  B  to confirm 

iiltercomparly bala~~ces. Scheciult; A listed an ageccy's intercompany receivables 2nd Schedule 

B its payables. 

IPG and McCann Failed to Ensure Intercompany Accounts Were Reconciled 

       34.    From at least 1997 through August 2002, McCannYs financial management, 

including its CFO, knew that IPGYs intercompany policies were not being followed. 

       35.    During this period, McCann financial management, including its CFO and 

EMEA's COO (who at relevant times also handled many aspects of EMEA's Finance Director's 

responsibilities) knew that intercompany disputes were not being resolved, and intercompany 

                                              8 
---------------------Page 9---------------------

accounts were not being fully reconciled. Moreover, McCann7s financial management learned 

that certain intercompany receivables would need to be written off, although they did not know 

the full extent of the write-off.  Despite this awareness, year after year, McCann's financial 

management failed to address and resolve these intercompany problems. 

       36.     During the relevant period, IPG and McCann also failed to devise a system of 

adequate internal controls to ensure that intercompany accounts were reconciled on a timely 

basis and expensed properly. 

       37.        Similarly, IPG and McCann also failed to ensure that McCann kept books and 

records that accurately and fairly reflected intercompany charges and transactions. 

                  McCann's Early Awareness of Intercompany Problems 

       38.    As early as 1997, McCann's financial management knew of general intercompany 

problems, which were the most  severe within EMEA, and in particular at MEA, due in part to 

MEA's role as a European and global coordinator of "club dues" and other expenses. ("Club 

ciues" are one tjp of intercompany t:a:;sacti~n. It represents costs ti~at werLc: inc~m-cd by one 

agency when coordinating services for a global client. The agency that incurred such costs 

subsequently re-charged a portion to the agencies whose business was enhanced.) 

       39.    In 1997, MEA's Finance Director met with McCann's CFO and controller and 

expressed concerns regarding the lack of a system to handle intercompany disputes. 

Additionally, MEA's Finance Director pointed out that intercompany policies were not being 

followed. McCann7s CFO responded that he was aware of these problems and it was on his 

agenda to be resolved. 
---------------------Page 10---------------------

       40.    By 1998, McCann's financial management was aware that intercompany 

imbalances and disputes in intercompany accounts would result in write-offs. 

       41.    On or about June 3, 1998, EMEAYs outgoing Finance Director sent an email to 

McCann's deputy controller that stated: "[I] see as a critical weakness in they (sic) way that our 

people handle intercompany transactions. They do not resolve disputes, they are left to stagnate, 

and the (sic) we have writeoffs." 

       42.    Additionally, on or about July 30, 1998, a senior financial staffer at EMEA sent 

an email to European finance directors, copied to EMEAYs COO, among others, stating in part 

that "I believe that we are all in agreement that the level of intercompany invoices now held in 

dispute has reached an unacceptable level." 

       43.    The EMEA financial staffer's July 30 email contained a plan to address the 

intercompany problem, and set a September 18, 1998 deadline for reconciling intercompany 

accounts. The email then stated, however, that "it is agreed that any write-offs of a material 

va!uz not be expensed u:ltil ianuzrjr ! 999." 

       44.    In a follow-up email to McCannYs controller and deputy controller dated August 

6, 1998, the EMEA financial staffer noted "I hope the information you are receiving on 

differences on intercompany balances will enable you to resolve the outstanding issues. Hey, 

what's a $28M discrepancy amongst fhends." 

       45.    McCann's financial management knew that the intercompany imbalance was a 

growing problem.  On or about September 28, 1998, McCannYs deputy controller sent a 

memorandum to all McCann finance directors, copied to McCann's CFO, stating that "[olver the 

last year intercompany differences have become increasingly material, individually and in the 
---------------------Page 11---------------------

aggregate. In June, as a group, McCann was out an astonishing $40 million.  To put this in 

perspective, IPG as a whole has never had an out of balance that large." 

       46.     The deputy controller's September 28, 1998 memorandum stated that all disputed 

items were to be resolved by October 3 1, 1998. 

                   McCann Failed to Resolve the Intercompany Problem     In 1998 

       47.    McCann did not resolve its intercompany problems in 1998 at least in part so that 

McCann could hit its annual profit targets. 

       48.    EMEA's agencies never completed the intercompany exercise described above 

because various offices asked for additional time to compile the necessary information, and then 

agencies had to begin preparing for the annual McCann Forward Planning Meeting. McCann's 

financial management never ensured that the agencies circled back to complete the intercompany 

project. 

       49.    PwC also raised the intercompany issue with McCann7s financial management. 

During tke i 997 and 13?8 audit years, PwC UK, MEAys  external auditors, iistcd intercs~pany 

as a significant internal accounting control weakness. PwC UK qualified its opinion with respect 

to intercompany balances in its Audit Summary Memorandum concerning MEA. 

       50.    Additionally, in or around November 1998, PwC US' global audit partner 

informed IPG's Audit Committee that "[ilntercompany accounts should be reconciled and 

confirmed on a timely basis." 

       McCann Failed to Resolve the Intercompany Problems in 1999 

       5 1.        Throughout 1999, intercompany problems at McCann continued to persist. 

       52.    In approximately September 1999, EMEA's COO assigned a member of EMEA's 

                                             11 
---------------------Page 12---------------------

financial staff to investigate the reasons intercompany accounts were not being settled and to 

resolve the underlying problems. 

       53.    Despite initiating this project, EMEA's financial staff failed to resolve the 

intercompany problems. 

       54.    At this time, EMEA was under pressure to hit increased profit targets.  In 1999, 

McCann senior management increased EMEA's profit target by     20%  from its profit target in 

1998. 

       55.    As a result, in or around August 1999, EMEA's COO sent an e-mail to EMEA 

agencies' finance directors instructing them to develop a specific plan to reach their targets 

because EMEA had: "a serious problem ahead of us with reference to achieving our regional 

profit target for this year." (Emphasis in original). 

       56.     EMEA's COO and others understood that reconciling intercompany accounts 

would result in write-offs. Based on a preliminary analysis, EMEA's financial staff concluded 

that there wzre Ilurnerous disputes ?bout intercompany invoices that had t3 bz resolved ~ici th2! 

resolving theses disputes would create losses that would affect EMEA's profit and loss ("P&L"). 

       57.    EMEA's COO, therefore, postponed the intercompany reconciliation during 1999 

so that EMEA would not miss hitting its profit targets.  On or about November 12, 1999, 

EMEA's COO sent an e-mail to the EMEA staff that stated: "I have chosen January as the date 

for the [intercompany] meeting as there are likely to be write-offs which I suspect we would 

want to make next year rather than this." 

       58.    In or around November 1999, McCann's financial staff was scheduled to attend a 

Forward Planning Meeting. 
---------------------Page 13---------------------

       59.     Prior to this planning meeting, MEA's Finance Director discussed the 

intercompany problems with McCann management, including McCann's CFO and EMEA's 

COO and told them there were significant amounts of unpaid intercompany receivables that were 

causing MEA's cash position to deteriorate.  Members of McCann's financial management told 

MEA's Finance Director that the intercompany problem would be sorted out. 

       60.  . 
              In October 1999, MEA's Finance Director discussed intercompany problems with 

PG's  Treasurer.  Specifically, MEA's Finance Director told IPG's Treasurer that intercompany 

balances were not being settled, that there was no process to reconcile intercompany balances, 

and that intercompany balances had not been reconciled in six years. 

       61.    When IPGYs Treasurer returned to New York, he relayed this information to 

PG's  CFO. 

       62.    Throughout 1999, PwC flagged intercompany as one of several areas of risk. 

PwC  UK  qualified its opinion on intercompany accounts at MEA in its 1999 MEA Audit 

Summary Memorandum. PviC      UI; noted that ME), coiltinzed to have difficulties in reco~ci!ino 3 

intercompany balances due to the volume of affiliates and the age of a number of disputed items. 

       63.    PwC US also alerted IPG management and its Audit Committee regarding 

problems with intercompany reconciliations. In its Internal Accounting Controls and Accounting 

Procedures for the year ended December 3 1, 1999, PwC US characterized intercompany as one 

of several priority one risks and stated: 

       IPG's intercompany out-of-balance has increased dramatically since year-end and 
       analysis and reconciliations are not performed at each period end to ensure that 
    .  intercompany accounts are properly stated.  We noted that intercompany invoices 
       are not consistently recorded properly and in accordance with IPG policy at the 
       agency level. All agencies must record all invoices when received, regardless of 
       disputed items.  However, disputed invoices are often not recorded by agencies 
                                             13 
---------------------Page 14---------------------

        and invoices often remain outstanding. We noticed several intercompany 
        invoices dating back as far as 1989. In addition, some agencies record the 
        invoices within trade payable and receivable accounts other than intercompany 
        accounts. 

        64.    PwC  US  characterized the risk arising from intercompany accounts as "failure to 

reconcile these amounts could result in misstated account. Lack of consistency in recording 

intercompany invoices can lead to an intercompany out-of-balance situation and ultimately result 

in misstatements to the consolidated financial statements." 

             McCann Financial Management Continued to Fail to Resolve McCann's 
                            Intercompany Problems in    2000- Early 2001 

       65.    McCann7s financial management, including its CFO, continued to fail to address 

its intercompany problems in 2000, despite receiving further warnings that intercompany 

problems remained. 

       66.    For example, MEA's Finance Director resigned his position in early 2000, and 

descSSe<  his    c3~Lation" in his resjgnatiofi letter to MEA's Manzgin~ Director s-tating: 

       1 hwe hi9liighted major problems  with ti:.r: intercomparly systcn~ and 
       implementation of our new computer systems, only to be instructed not to discuss 
       these matters fiuther as they are not issues. I understand that the intercompany is 
       being reviewed next year, this was tried last year and absolutely nothing 
       happened. 

       67.    The resignation letter was forwarded to McCann7s CFO and EMEA7s COO, 

among others. 

       68.    Additionally, in or around January 2000, a McCann treasury staff report prepared 

for McCann7s CFO and reviewed in draft form by McCann's controller, noted the existence of 

"[mlany outstanding intercompany invoices (both receivable and payable) are several years old - 

most notably between London and New York    . . . . It appears likely that many of these accounts 
                                             14 
---------------------Page 15---------------------

will not be settled in full . . . yet a reserve has not been established against which to eventually 

write them off." 

       69.    In late January or early February of 2000, an EMEA financial staff member 

reported on his project to identify EMEA's intercompany exposures to EMEA's COO and 

McCann's controller. The staff member estimated that the aggregate exposure over the years 

reviewed may be as high as $20-30 million. 

       70.    In late March 2000, EMEA's COO and members of EMEA's financial staff 

corresponded by e-mail with McCann's controller that the next step would be "agree with 

[McCann's controller on] the accounting treatment of these write offs." 

       71.    However, questions quickly surfaced concerning the thoroughness and accuracy 

of the EMEA's financial staff member's report. 

       72.    In early 2000, McCann hired a new Finance Director for EMEA. 

       73.        EMEA's new Finance Director learned of the EMEA's financial staffs 

intercompany project. ,Wer  reviewing the work that h:id bec:~ done, the new Finance Director 

immediately concluded the intercompany project was inadequate and that a proper intercompany 

reconciliation required collecting all Schedules A and B which reflected each offices' individual 

intercompany receivables and payables, and that the EMEA financial staff had not done this. 

       74.    The EMEA Finance Director then initiated his own exercise to quantify 

intercompany exposures. 

       75.    Subsequently, the EMEA Finance Director warned EMEA's COO and McCann's 

controller that his staff did not receive the required schedules from markets to prepare the 

reconciliations. On or about June 15,2000, EMEA's Finance Director sent an e-mail to EMEA's 
---------------------Page 16---------------------

COO and McCann's controller that stated: 

        for the last month we here in europe hq have been worlung on reconciling the 
        intercompany. We have made progress but still having difficulty getting local 
        schedules to tie into schedules submitted to ny and do not have schedules of any 
        kind fiom some offices. Care to guess the last time the intercompany was 
        actually reconciled?  Care to guess what we are finding so far?  Should I ask why 
        schedules A and B are not reconciled to balance sheets in ny on a quarterlylannual 
       basis. 

       76.     EMEA's COO responded "We have been dancing around this subject for years. 

Nobody want[ed] to address it." 

       77.     By the end of August 2000, EMEA's Finance Director still had been unable to 

complete the intercompany reconciliation project. 

       78.     In 2000 and 2001, McCann's unwillingness to reconcile its intercompany 

accounts and address intercompany exposures continued to be attributable to the pressure to hit 

profit targets. 

       79.    I:i or around March 2000, E?%iiEAys COO directed that EMEA   sl.:o~.lld delay 

sending out in:t?:compzny disputes for reso!ntion while new stl-etch targets for profits were being 

sent to those agencies because this would increase the amount of profitability the agency had to 

deliver because they would have to cover any write-offs associated with intercompany 

adjustments. 

       80.    In or around July 2000, concerned that EMEA would fail to reach profit targets, 

EMEA's COO wrote to EMEA's finance directors that: 

       Overall, the message is that we     to make the stretch goal. We will be held 
       responsible if we do not. . . . Put simply, the stretch goal is not a "goal", it is a 
       mandate and we are the people who make it  . . . by whatever means we can dream 
       up! (emphasis in original). 
---------------------Page 17---------------------

        81.        EMEA's COO discussed with McCann's CFO the proposed timing of write-offs 

and his concerns that intercompany write-offs would affect his ability to deliver on the profit 

target in the EMEA region. 

        82.    In November 2000, EMEA's COO, in an e-mail that summarized his 

conversations with McCann's CFO, directed that intercompany write-offs be taken in 2001 

rather than in 2000: 

       we want to implement this exercise at a time when people will have time to pick 
       up any itnercompany (sic) costs that are 'in dispute' and the best time to do this is 
       not now but rather at the beginning of 2001 (you will remember that we planned 
       to do this in the lSt quarter in 2000 to leave the rest of the year for people to make 
       up any shortfalls resulting from this exercise). 

       83.     McCann financial management continued to be aware of the intercompany 

problem and they expressed concerns about intercompany related write-offs in 2001. 

       84.     On February 12, 2001, EMEA's COO e-mailed EMEA's controller (and others) 

and indicated that McCann's CFO wanted to hold a meeting to analyze intercompany exposures 

       to the extent we can afford it, to book them in the same quarter. . . we cannot 
       afford heavy write offs this year with reference to the intercompany problem. 
       Ths  is something we are going to have to 'manage'  as, against my and 
       [McCann's controller's] wishes, our target for Europe profit this year has been 
       increased from our original submission. 

       85.        Moreover, in early 2001, McCann's Controller discussed with McCann's CFO an 

intercompany reconciliation plan that his deputy proposed.  This plan included recording older 

intercompany exposures as non-operating expenses. 

       86.     According to McCann's controller, McCann's CFO rejected the proposal because 

he wanted to first get a better understanding of the issue at hand, and the exposures themselves, 
---------------------Page 18---------------------

and he did not agree with the treatment the controller's office was proposing. 

        87.    McCann's   CFO  did not specify what additional information he needed and did not 

instruct his controller to conduct the exercise differently. This intercompany project, like the 

earlier projects, was simply never completed. 

        88.    PwC continued to flag intercompany issues in 2000.  For example, PwC   US' 2000 

Audit Plan provided to IPG's Audit Committee identified intercompany activity as one of several 

"area[s] of higher risk" and noted that intercompany activity would be an area of audit focus for 

the year. 

       89.        Similarly, as in previous years, PwC UK, in its Audit Summary Memorandum, 

concluded that it was unable to state an opinion whether MEA intercompany balances were fairly 

stated. 

       90.        During the 2000 year end closing for MEA, PwC UK auditors discussed with 

McCann's controller that the intercompany reconciliation remained in a "poor state." 

       91.    PwC:  LK's  Audit Summary Memorandum also      flagged a significant 21 ! million 

intercompany in -transit entry in the "AR-Other" account and noted that intercompany balances 

in that account should be reclassified. 

                       IPG's  2001 Restructuring and Other Asset Write-Off 

       92.       During the second and third quarters of 2001, faced with a sharp downturn in the 

advertising market and problems arising from a recent significant acquisition, IPG initiated a 

restructuring exercise that led IPG to record a total charge of $645.6 million in the third quarter 

of 2001 ("Restructuring"). The Restructuring focused on write-offs primarily associated with 

severance costs, headcount reductions, and real estate lease terminations. 

                                              18 
---------------------Page 19---------------------

       93.    Additionally, IPG wrote off $85.4 million of various unrealizable assets in the 

third quarter of 2001 ("Other Asset Write-Off'). 

       94.        During the planning for the Restructuring and Other Asset Write-off in or around 

May 2001, IPG requested that its subsidiaries, including McCann, provide information on all 

balance sheet exposures so that the company could address them as part of this exercise. 

       95.    In anticipation of this exercise, McCann agencies submitted information on 

intercompany exposures. For example, on or about May 22,2001, McCann's controller 

requested that McCann worldwide financial staff complete a template for certain balance sheet 

accounts, including amounts identified as "AIR Other Intercompany In-Transit" and "A/R Other 

Intercompany In Dispute." 

       96.    In response to these requests, on or about June 4,2001, EMEAYs controller 

submitted to McCann's controller a schedule that showed $42 million in intercompany exposures 

for periods prior to January 1,2000. 

       97.    In ay2roximately May  or jane 2001, PG  executives, including IPG's CFO and 

the Head of IPGYs Internal Audit, met with McCann's financial management, including 

McCann's CFO and McCann's controller. 

       98.    During these meetings, McCann's CFO and McCann's controller produced 

schedules that showed an approximately $20-$30 million aggregate intercompany write-off for 

McCann over the years reviewed. 

       99.    IPG's CFO and Head of Internal Audit reviewed these schedules and referred to 

McCann's write-off submission as a "wish list" or "Christmas in July." IPG's CFO and Head of 

Internal Audit felt that McCann wanted to write-off assets without having to do any work and to 
---------------------Page 20---------------------

get relief and a free ride in terms of recovery of assets that they didn't know whether they were 

impaired or not. 

        100.   PG7s CFO, after discussion with PwC  US, then determined that the Restructuring 

would not include intercompany exposures because these exposures reflected operating expenses 

that were not appropriate for restructuring under General Accepted Accounting Principles 

("GAAE"'). 

       101.   Further, PG7s CFO and Head of Internal Audit told McCann7s CFO and 

controller that McCann needed further detailed support to show that intercompany assets were 

impaired and should be written off as part of the Other Asset Write-Off. 

       102.   Despite knowledge of this potential exposure, neither McCann7s CFO nor 

McCann7s controller provided the additional information to IPG in 2001, nor did they set any 

reserves or write-off these amounts. 

                  A "Fundamental Breakdown      of Internal Controls" at McCann 

       ! 03.  Due to the magnixde  of write-offs at McCei111 in the Restructuring and Otlile; 

Asset Write-off, during August and September 2001, IPG internal audit and PwC embarked on 

an extensive review of balance sheet exposures at McCann, with a particular focus on EMEA. 

       104.   PwC then expressed concerns about the exposures and related internal controls 

within McCann directly to the IPG Audit Committee. PwC US7 worldwide engagement partner 

circulated a document to the Audit Committee at its October 1 1,2001 meeting entitled 

"Opportunities to Enhance The Company's Internal Control Framework." The document stated: 

       [tlhe extent of full scope external audits has only been increased incrementally in 
       line with the continued growth of IPG based upon an assessment that the control 
       environment was sufficient to support the level of growth experienced. Recent 
                                             20 
---------------------Page 21---------------------

        events, however, have revealed a fundamental breakdown of internal controls at a 
        minimum of two operating aoups.  [One of which was McCann.] (emphasis 
        added). 

        105.   PwC US' worldwide engagement partner later described one of the internal 

 control weaknesses as a lack of timely reconciliation of inter and intra company activities. 

        106.     Following additional discussionsy IPGYs CFO and Head of Internal Audit assured 

 PwC that remedial measures, including new financial staff and improved intercompany 

reconciliation processes, were being implemented to fully address any internal control issues. 

        107.   In the Fall of 2001, IPG and McCann removed McCann's controller and 

transferred him to another function within IPGYs headquarters. 

        108.     During his job transition in or around September 2001, McCann's outgoing 

controller met with IPGYs CFO and Head of Internal Audit and proposed a $30 million reserve 

for intercompany exposures. 

       109.    C?:i1c; 3icCann executives, incl~idil~g h4cCan1i's CFO and McCam:'; txw 

controller, generaliy agreed n.jL!~ this proposal to set resents, despite the fact a ti1010ug'n 

intercompany reconciliation still had not been performed. 

       110.   IPGYs CFO, after discussions with PwC, believed, however, that the reserve 

request lacked detailed support and therefore could not be taken. 

       1 1 1.     During late 2001 and early 2002, PwC UK continued to express concerns that 

intercompany transactions were improperly recorded. 

       1 12.   As in previous years, for the year ended December 3 1,2001, PwC UK qualified 

its opinion regarding MEAYs intercompany accounts in its Audit Summary Memorandum. PwC 

UKYs Audit Summary Memorandum also commented on intercompany amounts included in the 
                                             2 1 
---------------------Page 22---------------------

 "AR-Other" account, in addition to approximately $22 million of club dues that were recorded in 

 an "AR-Current" account instead of intercompany accounts. 

                       IPG  and McCann Finally Resolve Intercompany Issues 

        113.   In 2002, IPG's Audit Committee summoned McCann7s CFO to appear at its 

meeting in April and directed that all IPG subsidiaries reconcile their intercompany accounts by 

September 30,2002. 

        114.   As a result of this directive, on or about May 3,2002, McCann's new Controller 

announced that agencies had to reconcile all intercompany amounts by September 30,2002. 

        1 15.     The May 3 announcement also provided that agencies who did not eliminate their 

intercompany out-of-balance by June 30,2002 would be charged 10% of that amount, which 

would affect operating incentive amounts. 

       1 16.  In approximately late July 2002, EMEA claimed to have discovered that many 

receivables were aged and not collectible, and therefore required write-offs. 

       7.     During  early Aa~ust, IPS and ?wC  attempted 19 q~~ailtify espqsci-rs. 

       118.   On August 13,2002, IPG announced that it would restate its financial statements 

for the periods 1997 to March 31,2002, because it found a total of $68.5 million of charges, 

primarily in Europe, which had not been properly expensed over those years. Approximately 

$58 million of its proposed $68.5 million restatement was due to improperly expensed charges 

for intercompany activity within EMEA. 

       1 19.   On October 16,2002, IPG issued a press release indicating that it had identified 

an additional $50 million charge that had to be restated.  Approximately $40 million of these 

additional charges reflected intercompany transactions within EMEA, including charges for club 
---------------------Page 23---------------------

dues that needed to be written-off. 

       120.   On November 13,2002,    IPG  issued a press release announcing that it would 

restate an additional $60 million of charges in its restatement and that the final amount to be 

restated would be $181.3 million for the period 1997 through the quarter ended June 30,2002. 

       121.   In total, $101 million of the $18 1 million related to intercompany transactions, 

and approximately  7 1 % of the intercompany charge was attributable to MEA and EMEA. 

                  Reason for Intercompany Misstatements     - The Drive for Profits 

       122.   Shortly before the restatement announcements, McCann officials drafted various 

documents that attempted to explain the cause of the intercompany problems.  For example, in 

June 2002, EMEA's Managing Director requested that EMEA's COO, who by this time had 

been promoted to Deputy Director, draft an e-mail to explain how EMEA would not be able to 

reach its target if certain items were expensed and that EMEA should not be penalized for these 

       123.     EMEA's Deputy Director drafted this document, which EMEA's Managing 

Director sent on or about June 5,2002. In the intercompany section, the e-mail stated: 

       In common with other McCann regions, there are a large number of intercompany 
       accounts in EMEA that have not been reconciled for at least 10 years. This is 
       something that has built up over a long period of time.  It has nothing to do with 
       our performance this year and quite frankly, is something that should have been 
       cleared up a long time ago. As you know, it wasn't addressed earlier because of 
       its potential firstly, to expose sensitive issues like the Russia problem and 
       secondly, to undermine the profit imperative that required EMEA to use any 
       reserves it may have had to help deliver the 20-30% annual profit growth that we 
       have produced for the last several years. 

       124.   On or about August 9,2002, EMEA's controller faxed a memorandum to 
                                             23 
---------------------Page 24---------------------

 EMEAYs Managing Director describing the reasons for the intercompany problems at EMEA. 

 The memorandum stated: "Throughout the late 1990's and into 2000, the ME system and Europe 

 in particular did not address intercompany issues, partly due to a lack of cash in the region (there 

was little clear down of items) but more specifically due to the P&L impact." 

        125.   Finally, McCann's controller, in his handwritten notes regarding intercompany 

taken on or about July 29,2002,  wrote: "Drive for Profits!! Caused this." 

             IPG Continued to Fail to Resolve Its Financial Reporting Problems 

                        IPG Again Restated Financial Results in   2005 

        126.   IPG  did not address or correct all of its financial reporting problems in 2002. 

        127.   In September 2005, IPG  once again restated its financ.ia1 results. IPG restated its 

pre-tax income in the amount of $420 million for the years 2000 through 2003 and the nine 

months ended September 2004.  The 2005 restatement included numerous issues, and 

highlighted iilc contiu~!ec! isck of adepate illternal contro!~ throughou; IPGYs age:xies. 

IPG Improperly Recognized Revenue from AVBs 

       128.   A large portion of the restatement related to $199 million of improperly 

recognized revenue because IPG had failed to comply with contracts that required IPG agencies 

to pass AVBs and other credits and discounts provided by the media outlets to certain clients. 

Instead, regional and local agencies retained the AVBs and recorded them as revenues. 

       129.   AVBs are discounts or rebates given by media providers to advertising agencies 

for meeting certain objectives, such as total volume of business placed with the media providers 

for that year.  AVBs do not exist in the United States, but are given by media providers in much 
---------------------Page 25---------------------

of the rest of the world. 

        130.     Certain countries regulate AVBs, but for the majority of countries, whether an 

agency retains AVBs is a contractual matter between the agency and its client. 

        13 1.   Over the last decade, the advertising industry has faced client pressure to move 

from commission-based compensation to fee-based arrangements. As part of this trend, 

multinational clients increasingly requested from IPG and its agencies contractual clauses 

requiring the return of AVBs. 

        132.     Multinational client contracts were often negotiated at IPGYs or McCann's 

Worldgroup level. 

        133.   In some markets, however, local agencies and their local client counterparts 

negotiated, either in writing or orally, contractual terms providing that the local agency could 

retain AVBs, sometimes in exchange for the client paying a lower commission or fee rate.   (In 

certain markets, AVBs were a significant source of revenues.) These agreements conflicted with 

tile global coiltracts, often ,,:;l'oclinownst 19 tl:e local agency slid tii~ Worldgroup level 

employees. 

       134.     Since at least 2000, IPG and its agencies incorrectly recorded revenue attributable 

to AVBs that should have been returned to certain of their clients under the applicable contracts. 

       135.     While there were certain incidents of agencies attempting to hide the fact that they 

were retaining AVBs from their clients, in most cases the error was attributable to lack of 

internal controls. 

       136.     For example, IPG had no central repository for client contracts, and no 

mechanism to ensure that global contracts were being complied with.  Furthermore,   IPG had no 

                                               25 
---------------------Page 26---------------------

 system in place to ensure that contracts entered into at the regional or local level were consistent 

 with contracts entered into at the Worldgroup level. 

        137.   Additionally, in some instances, the contracts simply contained ambiguous 

 language. 

IPG's Inadequate Internal Controls Enabled Other Problematic Financial Practices 

        138.   The most significant remaining components of the 2005 restatement reflected 

internal control issues relating to IPG7s numerous acquisitions. 

        139.   IPG had to restate $34.8 million net of tax because its agencies had improperly 

recorded earnings (and revenue) from acquired businesses from a point in time that was prior to 

the closing date of the acquisitions, or the time when IPG had obtained effective control of the 

entity. 

        140.     Under GAAP, revenue and income of acquired companies should be recorded in 

the acquirer's financial statements after the acquisition date, or the date the acquirer has obtained 

effective control. 

       141.   The 2005 restatement also reduced earnings by $70.4 million net of taxes for 

contingent consideration paid to owners of acquired businesses that were accounted for as 

goodwill when these payments should have been accounted for as compensation costs. 

       142.   For example, when IPG or its operating agencies acquired companies, the 

acquisition agreements would often include earn-out clauses that would provide contingent 

consideration over several years for the acquired company's shareholders, who were executives 

or employees. These earn-out payments were contingent on the acquired company's future 

financial performance. In addition, these payments were often contingent on the selling 

                                              26 
---------------------Page 27---------------------

 shareholders' continued employment. 

        143.   In other acquisitions where IPG purchased only a portion of the business, IPG 

 negotiated put and call options to acquire additional equity. In some instances the put options 

 were contingent upon the We   employment of key personnel. 

        144.   Under GAAP, IPG should have recorded the earn-out payments and put payments 

 as compensation expense when they were contingent upon the employment of the shareholders 

or key personnel.  IPG, however, often recorded the payment as consideration for the acquisition 

and thus, capitalized it as an asset, i.e. goodwill. 

        145.   mle   IPG  attempted to address this error in 2004, its internal controls were not 

even sufficient to identify all of the contractual arrangements that its agencies had with owners 

of businesses it acquired. 

        146.   Finally, as part of the 2005 restatement, IPG also took write-offs related to 

internal investigations of possible employee malfeasance, accounting for international 

co;;ipexn:icn  agreements and lease acconr!tino. s 

D.         IPG Made Numerous Misstatements in its Public Filings 

       147.   IPG filed numerous Forms 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and Forms 8-K that contained 

misrepresentations due to the intercompany issues, the AVB issues, and the various other issues 

that were reflected in the 2002 and 2005 restatements.  Specifically, PG  misstated its earnings in 

its December 3 1,1997 Form 1 0-K, December 3 1,1998 Form 1 0-K, December    3 1,1999 Form 

1 0-K, December 3 1,2000 Form 1 0-K, December 3 1,200  1 Form 1 0-K, December 3 1,2002 Form 

1 0-K, and December 3 1,2003 Form  1 0-K, as well as Forms 10-Q and Forms 8-K during this 

period.  For example, as reflected in IPG's public filings, net income was overstated by $85.7 
---------------------Page 28---------------------

million or 3 1% in the year ended December 3 1,2000 and $82.8 million or 496% in the year 

ended December 31,2002.  IPG's net loss was understated   by $98 million or 16% in 2001 and 

$87.4 million or 16% in 2003.  Precise misstatement information for the years 1999 and earlier is 

not available because the 2005 restatement did not give the year by year impact of the 

cumulative restatement total for those years of $137.7 million. However, net income for the 

years 1999 and 1998 were overstated by $19.2 million (6%) and $12.4 million (4%) due to the 

2002 restatement alone. 

        148.   While IPG was inaccurately reporting its financial results, IPG conducted various 

securities offerings. For example, in connection with an August 22,2001 offering of unsecured 

notes, IPG filed a Form S-4.  Additionally, on October 20,2000, IPG issued senior unsecured 

notes and filed a Form S-3. 

                                   FIRST   CLAIM    FOR  RELIEF 

                               IPG Violated Sections 17(a)(2)  and  (3) 
                                        of the Securifies Art 

       149.     The Commission repeats and realleges each and every allegation contained in 

paragraphs 1 through 125, as if fully set forth herein. 

       150.   Section 17(a)(2) and (3) prohibits directly or indirectly any person, in the offer or 

sale of securities, by the use of the means and instruments of transportation and communication 

in interstate commerce or by use of the mails: (a) to obtain money or property by means of or 

otherwise make untrue statements of material facts or omit to state material facts necessary in 

order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, 

not misleading; and (b) to engage in transactions, practices or courses of business which operate 

                                             2 8 
---------------------Page 29---------------------

or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon purchasers of securities. 

        15 1.   As part of, and in hrtherance  of the violative conduct, in connection with 

intercompany transactions, IPG negligently made material misrepresentations about its financial 

results in periodic filings, and failed to disclose material information, to investors in IPG. 

        152.   By reason of the conduct described above, IPG violated, and unless enjoined will 

violate again, Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. $5 77q(a)(2) and (3). 

                                  SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF 

                     McCann Violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act 
                            and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act 
                                        and Rule lob-5 

        153.   The Commission repeats and realleges each and every allegation contained in 

paragraphs 1 through 125 as if fully set forth herein. 

        154.   McCann, directly or indirectly, in the offer or sale, and in connection with the 

purchase or sale of securities, by the use of the nlea?:s and i~struments of transpo~t;c.,~ion or 

communicatio:~  ir, i:lterstatc commerce, or by use of tl~e ;nails: (a) employed devices, schemes 

and artifices to defraud; (b) obtained money or property by means of, or otherwise made, untrue 

statements of material facts or omitted to state material facts necessary in order to make the 

statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and 

(c) engaged in transactions, practices or courses of business which operated or would operate as 

a fi-aud or deceit upon purchasers of securities. 

       155.     As part of, and in furtherance of the violative conduct, McCann made material 

misrepresentations, and failed to disclose material information about its intercompany 

transactions in its financial statements, and McCann knew this information would be 
                                              29

 consolidated into IPGYs financial results. 

        156.   McCann acted recklessly. 

        157.   By reason of the conduct described above, McCann violated, and unless enjoined 

will again violate, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. § 77q(a), Section lO(b) of the 

Exchange Act, 15 U.S:C.  5 78j(b), and Rule lob-5 thereunder, 17 C.F.R. 5 240.10b-5.

                                         thereunder) 

        158.     The Commission realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 148 by 

reference as if hlly  set forth herein. 

       159.   IPG, whose securities are registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act, 

failed to file annual, quarterly and current reports with the Commission that were true and 

con-ect, aild f2ilec'i to include maleri31 in Form ation in its required s:ai?;-r?ents aid reports as was 

necessary to rllake the required st~ten;ents, in iigi~t of the circumstances under which they were 

made, not misleading. 

       160.   IPG materially misstated its financial results due to a number of factors, including 

its failure to account properly for intercompany transactions, AVBs, and certain acquisitions. 

       161.   By reason of the conduct described above, IPG violated Section 13(a) of the 

Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. $78m(a), and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13, 17 C.F.R.

                           McCann Aided and Abetted IPG's Violations 
                          of the Reporting Provisions of the Exchange Act

                                        thereunder) 

        162.   The Commission realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 148 by 

reference as if fully set forth herein. 

       163.   McCann knowingly provided substantial assistance to IPG in the commission of 

some or all of the violations by PG  of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 5 78m(a),

1 3,  thereunder. 

       164.   For example, McCann failed to properly account for its intercompany 

transactions, and because IPG issued consolidated financial results for its subsidiaries, including 

McCann, IPG's financial statements were inaccurate. 

       165.   By :-casou of the co:~d;:ct described above, fiAcCann, pursuant to Sectioii 20(e) oi

 and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflected the transactions and 

 dispositions of its assets. 

        168.   From at least 1997 through 2005, PG  failed to devise and maintain a system of 

internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances, to record transactions, 

maintain accountability of its assets, and permit financial statements to be prepared in conformity
