                                            Facts 
 
              3.     From approximately mid-2008 through June 30, 2011, AgFeed    s publicly-
reported revenues were inflated falsely by approximately $239 million due to actions by former 
members of AgFeed  s Chinese management including, among other things, inflating revenues by 
booking sales of non-existent hogs and manipulating hog weights, and later covering it up by, 
among other things, reporting that the fake hogs had died.   
        
              4.     In September 2010, AgFeed began a plan of expansion by merging with a 
privately-held U.S. company.  Respondent, who had no prior experience with Commission -
reporting companies, joined AgFeed as part of the merger.  By approximately early June 2011, 
Respondent was generally aware that allegations of fraud had been reported regarding operations 
in the Jiangxi region, one of the five Chinese regions where AgFeed maintained hog farms, and 
that the Company was investigating the fraud allegations.     
        
              5.     In or about mid-June 2011, Respondent, and others, learned of a new report 
of fraud allegations regarding operations in another AgFeed Chinese region (the Fujian region).  
Among other things, the report alleged that the Company had recorded false revenues and inflated 
fixed assets.  Thereafter, Respondent knew or should have known that AgFeed failed to undertake 
a meaningful investigation regarding the Fujian region fraud allegations.  Further, Respondent 
knew or should have known that the Company, following a limited review of its fixed assets, was 
unable to substantiate its fixed asset values.    Further, Respondent learned that information had been 
discovered relating to the maintenance of two sets of accounting books in the Companys China 
operations.  Respondent, even after he was promoted on July 15, 2011 to CFO of the Company, 
did not ensure that appropriate action was taken to determine whether AgFeeds current or prior 
financial statements were accurate.   
 
              6.     On August 2, 2011, AgFeed    published its earnings release for the period 
ended June 30, 2011.  Respondent knew or should have known that AgFeed   s financial 
statements included therein were false and misleading.    
        
              7.     On August 9, 2011, Respondent signed the Company    s management 
representation letter to AgFeeds independent auditor.  The management representation letter  
was materially false or misleading as it, among other things, failed to disclose the fraud 
allegations relating to the Fujian region.    
        
              8.     On August 9, 2011, AgFeed filed with the Commission the Companys 
Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2011 (the Form 10-Q), which Respondent signed and 
certified as CFO.  The Form 10-Q was incorporated into the Companys active June 2009 Form S-
3 registration statement.  The Form 10-Q also incorporated by reference the Companys Form 10-
K for the period ended December 31, 2010.  Respondent knew or should have known that the  
Companys Form 10 -Q for the period ended June 30, 2011 was false and misleading.   
        

                                              3

               9.     On December 19, 2011, AgFeed finally disclosed that financial accounting 
staff and management based in China engaged in accounting improprieties and that the 
Companys previously issued unaudited financial statements for the quarters ended March 31 and 
June 30, 2011, as well as its audited financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2010 
and 2009, should be restated.  As a result, the Companys consolidated balance sheets as of March 
31 and June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Companys consolidated statements of 
operations and other comprehensive income (loss) for the quarters ended March 31 and June 30, 
2011 and the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Companys consolidated statements of 
cash flows for the quarters ended March 31 and June 30, 2011 and the years ended December 31, 
2010 and 2009 and the footnotes thereto should no longer be relied upon.  On January 31, 2012, 
AgFeed further disclosed that due to the accounting irregularities in China, the Companys 
audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2008 should no longer be relied 
upon. 
        
                                            Violations 
        
               10.    Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act prohibits any person from obtaining 
money or property by means of untrue statement of material facts or omissions, in the offer or sale 
of securities.  Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act proscribes any transaction, practice or course 
of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit in the offer or sale of 
securities.  A violation of these provisions may be established by a showing of negligence.  Aaron 
v. SEC, 446 U.S. 680, 697  (1980).   
               11.    Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13a-13 thereunder require 
issuers of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act, such as AgFeed, to file 
with the Commission accurate quarterly reports.  Rule 12b -20 of the Exchange Act requires that 
these reports contain such further material information as may be necessary to make the required 
statements in the reports not misleading.  Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act requires issuers 
to make and keep books, records, and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly 
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the issuer.  Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 
prohibits any person from directly or indirectly falsifying, or causing to be falsified, any book or 
record subject to Section 13(b)(2)(A).  Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act requires reporting 
companies to devise and maintain a n adequate system of internal accounting controls.  Rule 13b2- 2 
of the Exchange Act prohibits officers and directors from, directly or indirectly, making or causing 
to be made materially false or misleading statements or omissions to accountants in connection 
with an audit or preparation of reports to be filed with the Commission.  Rule 13a-14 of the 
Exchange Act requires that the principal executive and financial officers certify each periodic 
report containing financial statements filed by an issuer pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Exchange 
Act.3
        
 
                                                 
3
 Under Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the principal executive and financial officers are required to 
certify, among other things, that:  (1) they reviewed annual and quarterly reports; (2) based upon their knowledge, 
the report does not omit or misstate a material fact; and (3) they had disclosed any fraud, whether or not material, 
involving management to the audit committee and the auditors.

               12.    As a result of the conduct described above, Marshall willfully4
                                                                                      violated 
Sections 17(a) (2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act, and Rules 13a-14, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 under 
the Exchange Act, and was a cause of AgFeeds violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 
13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder. 
  
                                               IV. 
                                                  
               13.    Pursuant to this Order, Respondent agrees to additional proceedings in this 
proceeding to determine what, if any, civil penalties pursuant to Section 8A(g) of the Securities 
Act and Section 21B(a) of the Exchange Act against Respondent are in the public interest.    In 
connection with such additional proceedings: (a) Respondent agrees that he will be precluded 
from arguing that he did not violate the federal securities laws described in this Order; (b) 
Respondent agrees that he may not challenge the validity of this Order; (c) solely for the 
purposes of such additional proceedings, the allegations of the Order shall be accepted as and 
deemed true by the hearing officer; and (d) the hearing officer may determine the issues raised in 
the additional proceedings on the basis of affidavits, declarations, excerpts of sworn deposition 
or investigative testimony, and documentary evidence. 
 
                                                V. 
                                                  
        In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in Respondent Marshalls Offer. 
 
        Accordingly, pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act, Sections 4C and 21C of the 
Exchange Act, and Rule 102(e)(1)(iii) of the Commissions Rules of Practice it is hereby 
ORDERED that: 
 
       A.      Respondent Marshall shall cease and desist from committing or causing any 
violations and any future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 13(a), 
13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 13a-13, 13a-14, 13b2-1, 13b2-2 and 
12b-20 promulgated thereunder. 
 
       B.      Respondent Marshall is  denied the privilege of appearing or practicing before the 
Commission as an accountant.   
 
       C.      After five years from the date of this order, Respondent may request that the 
Commission consider his reinstatement by submitting an application (attention: Office of the 
Chief Accountant) to resume appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant.

 A willful violation of the securities laws means merely that the person charged with the duty knows what he is 
doing. Wonsover v. SEC, 205 F.3d 408, 414 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (quoting Hughes v. SEC, 174 F.2d 969, 977 (D.C. 
Cir. 1949)).

---------------------Page 6---------------------

       D.     IT IS FURTHER ORDERED pursuant to Rule 100(c) of the Commissions Rules 
of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.100(c), in the interest of justice and without prejudice to any party, 
that a public hearing for the purpose of taking evidence on the questions set forth in Section IV 
hereof shall be convened at a time and place to be fixed, and before an Administrative Law Judge 
to be designated by further order as provided by Rule 110 of the Commissions Rules of Practice, 
17 C.F.R. § 201.110,  following the entry of a final judgment against the last remaining 
defendant(s) in Securities and Exchange Commission v. AgFeed Industries, Inc., et al. (M.D. TN) 
(the Related Actions). 

       If Marshall fails to appear at a hearing after being duly notified, Marshall may be deemed 
in default and the proceedings may be determined against him upon consideration of this Order, 
the allegations of which may be deemed to be true as provided by Rules 155(a), 220(f), 221(f), and 
310 of the Commissions Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), 201.220(f), 201.221(f), and 
201.310. 

       This Order shall be served forthwith upon Marshall personally or by certified mail. 

       E.     IT IS FURTHER ORDERED pursuant to Rule 100(c) of the Commissions Rules 
of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.100(c), in the interest of justice and without prejudice to any party, 
that the Administrative Law Judge shall issue an initial decision no later than 120 days from the 
date of the entry of a final judgment in the Related Actions. 

       In the absence of an appropriate waiver, no officer or employee of the Commission 
engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions in this or any factually related 
proceeding will be permitted to participate or advise in the decision of this matter, except as 
witness or counsel in proceedings held pursuant to notice.  Since this proceeding is not rule 
making within the meaning of Section 551 of the Administrative Procedure Act, it is not deemed 
subject to the provisions of Section 553 delaying the effective date of any final Commission action. 

       By the Commission.
