        Thomas D. Melvin, a certified public accountant and a principal in the accounting firm of 
Melvin, Rooks, and Howell in Griffith, Georgia, appeals from an initial decision permanently 
disqualifying him from practicing before the Commission, based on his having been enjoined 
                                                                                                 1
from violating antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and rules thereunder.             We base 
our findings on a  n independent review of the record, except with respect to those findings not 
                          
challenged on appeal.
 
I.      BACKGROUND 

        A.       Melvin consented to the entry of an injunction in federal district court. 

        On April 10, 2013, Melvin settled civil proceedings by consenting to the entry of a final 
judgment (the "Injunctive Order") that permanently enjoined him from violating Exchange Act 
                                                                            2
Sections 10(b) and 14(e) and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3.                As part of that settlement, 
he agreed that, "in any disciplinary proceeding before the Commission based on the entry of the 
injunction  in this action, Melvin understands that he shall not be permitted to        contest the factual 
allegations of the complaint in this action."     
 
        The complaint in the civil proceeding (the "Complaint") alleged that, in December 2009, 
Melvin learned about a pending tender offer involving the stock of Chattem, Inc., a Tennessee-
based distributor of over-the-counter pharmaceutical products.  Melvin learned of the tender 
offer from a longtime accounting client, who was a Chattem director and who consulted Melvin 
to "mitigat[e] the personal tax liability that would accompany [the] tender offer and forced 
exchange of" Chattem stock options the director held.  But, according to the Complaint, the 
client "made clear," and Melvin understood, that the tender offer information was confidential 
and disclosed "solely for the purpose of obtaining tax advice."  Nonetheless, within an hour of 
discussing the tender offer with this client, Melvin called a longstanding client of his accounting 
practice and told him of the pending offer, including the information that Chattem was to be 
acquired in the near future and that the purchase price for Chattem would be approximately $90 
per share.  Over the next few days, Melvin made similar disclosures to two other long-time 
                                                                  3
accounting clients and a partner in his accounting practice.          Each of the four  tippees who 
learned of the tender offer from Melvin traded in Chattem st        ock,  the price of which rose

        15 U.S.C.   § §  78j(b), 78n(e); 17 C.F.R.  § §  240.10b -5, 240.14e  -3.  Melvin also agreed to 
disgorge approximately $61,328 in profits and $6,995 in prejudgment interest (for whic             h he was 
jointly and severally liable with other persons involved in the misconduct), and to pay a civil 
penalty of $108,930.05.      

        Melvin signed a second consent on June 28, 2013.  There is no material difference 
between the two consents with respect to t     he issues on appeal.

        Two of the accounting clients were also close friends of Melvin.

                                                                   4
substantially on the day the tender offer was announced.              Moreover, Melvin's four tippe      es told 
five  other people  about the Chattem tender offer;        these   five  tippees also traded in the stock   , and 
one of them tipped two additional people, who also traded            .  Eventually, according to the 
Complaint, at least    ten  individuals (not including Melvin) t      raded the stock based on inside 
                                                                                                           5
information obtained directly or indirectly from Melvin           , profiting by more than $550,000       .   

  
         The Georgia Board of Accountancy Code of Professional Conduct (the "Code") expressly 
provided that a Georgia-licensed CPA, such as Melvin, could not, without the consent of his 
client, disclose any confidential information pertaining to the client that the CPA obtained in the 
course of performing professional services.  The Complaint alleged that Melvin "[d]isregard[ed] 
the duty of confidentiality owed to his client and imposed on him by the [Code,] misappropriated 
the material non-public information . . . and disclosed" that information to others.  His 
misappropriation and disclosures were alleged to have provided him a benefit in the form of 
furthering his professional and personal relationships.   
 

         B.      An administrative law judge permanently disqualified Melvin from 
                 practicing before the Commission. 

        On December 20, 2013, we issued an Order Instituting Proceedings ("OIP"), based on the 
                                                                          6
Injunctive Order and pursuant to Rule of Practice 102(e)(3)(i),             and temporarily suspended 
                                                                         7
Melvin from appearing or practicing before the Commission               .   In doing so, we found that 
                                                                            8
suspending Melvin      was  "appropriate and     in the public interest   ."    Melvi  n filed a timely petition 
                                      9                      10
to lif t the temporary suspension,      which w   e denied  .    We also   directed that a hearing be held 
before a law judge to "determine[] what, if any, action may be appropriate to protect the 

                                                  
4
        The acquisition price represented a roughly 33% premium over the closing price for 
Chattem stock on the day preceding announcement of the merger.                  

5
        The Complaint a      lleges that Melvin's four tippees "and six others" traded in the securities 
of Chattem based on the material non        -public information that Melvin disclosed, but it 
enumerates a total of eleven traders:  Melvin's four tippees, their five tippees, and two more                
remote tippees.    Our determination that Melvin        's  permanent disqualifi   cation   from appearing or 
practicing before the Commission         is  an appropriate sanction would be the same wheth           e r there 
were ten or eleven tippees.

Commission's processes" in light of the Injunctive Order.                      On September 22, 2014,         the  law 

judge issued an initial decision        permanently      disqualify   ing  Melvin    from practicing before the 
                 12                              13
Commission.           This appeal followed.         

 

II.      Analysis  

         A.        Burden of Proof and Standard of Review 

         The Division introduced evidence, and it is undisputed, that Melvin was permanently 
                                                                                        14
enjoined from violating "provision[s] of the Federal securities laws."                        As a result, under our 

rules,   "the burden  " passed to Melvin        " to show cause    "  why he should not be censured or 

dis qualified from appearing and practicing before              us.    In  determining    whether    that burden has 

been met and assessing an appropriate sanction, we                 are guided by the      strong   and clear   public 
                                                               15
interest in ensuring the integrity of our         processes    .     That assessment i    s, in turn,  in formed    by our 

consideration of public interest factors we traditionally consider in other types of administrative 

proceedings,     including    the egregiousness of the respondent's actions, the isolated or recurrent 

nature of the infraction, the de       gree of scienter involved, the sincerity of the respondent's 

assurances against future violations, the respondent's recognition of the wrongful nature of his or 
                                                                  16
her conduct, and the likelihood         of future violations.          Our application of these factors is        flexible

         The Initial Decision allowed twenty            -one days after service of the Initial Decision for 

filing petitions of review, citing Rule of Practice 360, 17 C.F.R.                 §  201.360.  But Rule of Practice 

540, 17 C.F.R.     §  201.540, requires that a petition for review of an i            nitial decision as to whether a 

temporary sanction shall be made permanent must be filed within ten days after service of the 

initial decision.  The Initial Decision was served on Melvin on September 22, 2014                         , and Melvin 

fil e d his petition  for review of October 14, 2014.            Alth ough the petition was not timel         y filed in 

accordance with Rule 540, we have determined, in an exercise of our discretion, to grant review 

in this instance    given the longer period specified in the Initial Decision              .

                                         17
and no single factor is dispositive.    We also consider the extent to which a sanction may have a 
                  18
deterrent effect.    
 
        Applying these factors, and based on our consideration of all the circumstances 
surrounding Melvin's misconduct, we find that he represents such a significant threat to the 
integrity of our processes that he must be permanently disqualified from appearing or practicing 
before us.  Beginning almost immediately after receiving what he understood to be confidential 
                                                 19
information, Melvin, acting with scienter,          directly tipped three clients and his partner       in 
separate conversations    ,  abusing his position of trust to enhance professional relationships that 
could yield him pecuniary gain.        By misappropriating the information and disclosing            it for 
personal benefit, Melvin defrauded the client whose information he misused, "feigning fidelity to 
the source of [the misappropriated] information" and thus engaging in "fraud akin to 
                   20
embezzlement."          Melvin's four  tippees continued to pass along the        misappropriated 
information, such that Melvin's misconduct ultimately led to trading by at least ten individuals.  
More  o ver,  Melvin's disclosures were particularly serious because the non           -public information 
                            21
relat ed to a tender offer ,   and  the  specific det ails  he passed along about     the imminen    ce of the 
tender offer and the anticipated share price       enhanc  ed  the tippees' ability to profit from the 
misappropriated information       .   We  have   stated that conduct that violates the antifraud provisions 
                                                                                            22
of the federal se  curities laws, including insider trading, is "especially serious"           and warrants 
                                 23
"'the severest of sanctions.'"        And we  have held    that "'[f]idelity to the public interest' requires a 
severe sanction when a respondent's misconduct involves fraud because the                  'securities business is

          Melvin violated explicit professional              conduct     standards and betrayed          the trust placed in 

him by a longtime        client   seeking tax accounting advice            .   As we previously stated in the 

analogous context of an inves           tment banker who disclosed a client's confidential information in 

order to favor his own interest in establishing a collegial relationship,                       

           

          [t] he ability to credibly assure a client that [obviously confidential] information 

          will be used solely to advance            the client's own interests is central to any securities 

          professional's ability to provide informed advice to clients.  Disclosure of such 

          information jeopardizes the foundation of trust and confidence crucial to any 
                                                         26
          professional advising relationship.               

Me lvin's   unethical and illegal        actions were,     in our view, clearly egregious.             The betrayal of trust, 

the rapidity with which he share           d  the confidential information, the details he passed on about the 

tender offer, and the tipping of multiple business associa                   tes all contribute to our assessment of 

the gravity of his misconduct.            Although Melvin        's violation involved one misappropriation of 

client information, it was not an           'isolated  ' infraction, as he passed the information along to four 

people at four different times.  Thus, Melvin chose to breach his client                       's trust on four different 

occasions, each giving him a chance to reflect on his actions.                      W e see little recognition by 

Melvin o    f the wrongfulness of his actions and              find   that, given   those   actions   , he  constitutes    an 

unacceptable threat to our processes             .   We further find that Melvin's permanent disqualification 
                                                                                                                                27

         Melvin does not dispute the allegations that form the basis for the Injunctive Order,                       but  

argues that   they   do  not justify  his  permanent disqualification.        In support, h   e  asserts   that he did 

not personally trade on the informa         tion or benefit   financially    from his actions.  According to 

Melvin, the misappropriation was an "isolated event in an otherwise law                   -abiding and productive 

life."  He further claims that he has recognized his misconduct                by agreeing to    settl e  the matter 

and  timely pay    the amounts agreed to in the settlement.            Rather than permanent disqualification, 

Melvin argues that "[i]t is appropriate to impose a three year bar" which is consistent, he asserts, 
                                                                        29
with   settlement   discussions he had with Division counsel.               Al though he acknowledges that the 

Commission is not bound by such discussions,               he asserts that   it should nevertheless      consider 

what   "the SEC employee most familiar with"             the case believes would be "appropriate given all 

that [th  e employee] knew of the case."             

          

         We are unpersuaded by Melvin's effort to minimize the                 seriousness of his misconduct.          

His argument     that his conduct was no       t so bad because he was "only a tipper"           fails to 

acknowledge how destructive that conduct was.                 Melvin's misconduct created subst         antial losses, 

or the risk of substantial losses, to ot     her persons    :  he defrauded Chattem of the exclusive use of 
                                                                                                                  30
the tender offer information, conduct that the Supreme Court has likened to embezzlement                         ,   a nd 

he undermined the integrity of the negotiating            process for the tender offer, thus creating the risk 
                                                                                             31
of substantial losses to both the target company and the potential acquirer.                     Moreover, the 

                                                   
28
         As noted, Melvin agreed that he woul           d not challenge allegations supporting the 

Injunctive Order in a related Commission disciplinary proceeding.                   See Rule of Practice 

101(a)(3), 17 C.F.R. § 201.101(a)(3) (defining "disciplinary proceeding" to mean "an action 

pursuant to Rule 102(e)").  Melvin is therefore precluded from contesting the Complaint's 

allegations here, and we may consider them in determining an appropriate sanction.  See, e.g., 

Siris v. SEC, 773 F.3d 89, 96 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (holding that the Commission "was entitled to rely 

on the allegations of the complaint" in deciding whether to impose a permanent bar in a follow-

on proceeding based on a consent judgment, where the terms of the consent judgment 

"unambiguously barred Siris from making any future challenge to the allegations in the 

complaint") (citations omitted); Toby G. Scammell, 2014 WL 5493265, at *3, 7 (refusing to 

consider "claims that impermissibly contradict the allegations of the complaint" in determining 

sanctions in follow-on proceeding based on injunction entered by consent, where Scammell had 

"specifically agreed [in the consent agreement] that he would not contest the factual allegations 

of the complaint in any administrative proceeding before the Commission"). 

29
         Melvin asserts in his pleadings that he and Division st             aff agreed, in connection with 

discussions regarding settlement of the civil proceedings, that he also would "not be banned from 

practicing before the Commission . . . in excess of three years."  He further asserts that he first 

learned that the Commission          was "not honoring the agreement" several months later, after the 

OIP was issued.  Nevertheless, Melvin concedes in his brief that "the Commission itself is not 

bound by the commitments of its [D]ivision counsel."

                                                                                     33
trading himself and then giving the trading profits to those individuals.                 H ad Melvin not 
misappropriated the confidential client information and passed it along, the ensuing improper 
trading  , which resulted in   illegal   profits of more than half a million dollars,      would not have 
happened   , making Melvin's conduct in some respects m            ore "directly culpable" than that of the 
                                    34
tippees who personally traded      .     And, as discussed above, Melvin is not permitted to contest the 
fact that he personally benefitted from his unlawful disclosures by furthering personal a                nd 
                               35
professional relationships    .     Despite  Melvin'  s  attempt  to minimize the benefits      he received  , they 
apparently were sufficient to motivate the multiple instances of misconduct at issue here, 
providing reason to believe that they could do so again.            His actions reveal a highly troubli     ng 
willingness to ignore    a  fundamental professional       obligation   to respect  and protect   client 
                                                                                                                 36

         long recognized that the fundamental unfairness of insider trading harms not only

Our view that conduct   like Melvin's merits significant sanctions is evident from a similar case in

was not charged with trading and received no    direct   economic benefit for the tip he provided.      

       Nor do we consider it significant that, as Melvin claims, he discussed a possible 
settlement with our staff that would have resulted   in his disqualification for a number of years

July 17, 2013) (permanently enjoining Gupta from further violations of the securities laws and 
imposing officer-director and associational bars "notwithstanding the fact that Gupta's long-term 
pecuniary gain from the insider trading conspiracy was speculative").   
 
       Melvin does not raise any argument challenging the factual premises that underlie his 
liability as a tipper under Exchange Act Section 10(b) or 14(e) and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 
and 14e-3.  Nor can he, because as part of settling the civil proceeding he agreed not to contest 
the factual allegations of the Complaint in this disciplinary proceeding.  Accordingly, we 
understand Melvin's argument that he did not personally trade as an attempt to establish a 
mitigating factor regarding relief, not as a challenge to his underlying liability.  In any event, 
there would be no merit to such a challenge to his liability.  The Complaint alleged that Melvin's 
misappropriation and disclosures were alleged to have provided him a benefit in the form of 
furthering both his personal and professional relationships.  See Dirks, 463 U.S. at 663-64 
("reputational benefit that will translate into future earnings" is sufficient); SEC v. Yun, 327 F.3d 
1263, 1280 (11th Cir. 2003) (sufficient personal benefit where tipper and tippee worked closely 
together and were frequently partners in real estate deals); SEC v. Sergeant, 229 F.3d 68, 77 (1st 
Cir. 2000) (tipping "to maintain a useful networking contact" is sufficient personal benefit); 
United States v. Newman, 773 F.3d 438, 452-53 (2d Cir. 2014) (tipping that "could yield future 
pecuniary gain," including a "referr[al]" or monetary "commission," is sufficient).  The 
allegation that Melvin had a close personal relationship with his tippees independently supports 
the sufficiency of his personal benefit.  See Dirks, 463 U.S. at 663-64; Lohmann, 2003 WL 
21468604, at *4; Yun, 327 F.3d at 1275; Sargent, 229 F.3d at 77; SEC v. Obus, 693 F.3d 276, 
285 (2d Cir. 2012).  Finally, a breach of fiduciary duty for personal benefit is not an element of 
liability under Exchange Act Section 14(e) and Rule 14e-3.  See O'Hagan, 521 U.S. at 676; 
Tender Offers, 1980 WL 20869, at *5-13 (Sept. 4, 1980).

rather than permanently.  As he acknowledges, we are not bound by such discussions,                    and  we 
have repeatedly held that sanctions imposed in connection with settlements are frequently less 
                                                  40
severe than those that    result from litigation.      There is no suggestion that    Melvin   was in any way 
prevented from identifying the circumstances that, according to him, led a member of our staff to 
conclude   (or  that  otherwise support his position)    that disqualification for a ter  m of years   is 
           41
sufficient.    We have carefully consider      ed the evidence he has presented and his arguments in 
mitigation, but conclude that they do not justify any leniency.           
         
        Although Melvin asserts that he "has recognized the wrongful nature of what trans                pired," 
his arguments on appeal support a contrary conclusion.  His contention that although his conduct 
was bad, the conduct of his partner, who also engaged in fraudulent misconduct related to the  
Chattem tender offer, was worse, indicates that he does          not appreciate the seriousness of his 
              42

        Melvin asserts that his partner "admitted to misappropriating" confidential information 
about the  Chattem tender offer, but cites nothing to support this assertion.  We are unaware of 
any allegations   that the partner misappropriated confidential information, as opposed to trading 
on the basis of confidential information that Melvin disclosed to him.  Based on the premise that 
the partner's conduct was worse than his, Melvin argues that any sanction imp              osed on him 
should be less serious than the permanent suspension from appearing or practicing as an 
accountant imposed on his partner.

        C.       The proceeding was timely instituted. 

 

         Melvin also challenges his disqualification on procedural grounds, arguing that "these 

proceedings were untimely under clearly established federal law," because the order of 

temporary suspension (which was included in the OIP) was not issued until December 20, 2013, 

more than 90 days after entry of the Injunctive Order.  Under Rule of Practice 102(e)(3), the 

temporary suspension order had to be issued no "more than 90 days after the date on which the 

final judgment has become effective, whether upon completion of review or appeal procedures or 
                                                                                  43
because further review or appeal procedures are no longer available."                  Melvin does not dispute 

that, under  the F  ederal   R ules  of Appellate Procedure   , he had 60 days to     file a notice of appeal of    

the Injunctive Order, but     he  contends that because he waived        his right to appeal the Injunctive 

Order  , "ap peal procedures [were] no longer available" within the terms of Rule 102(e)(3) from 

the time the  Injunctive Order     was  entered  , and that Rule 102(e)(3)'s 90     -day limit  therefore 

expired on November 12, 2013.  The Division responds that, though "he was almost                     certain to 

fail, Melvin was free to file a notice of appeal and challenge the judgment" and that, therefore, 

the  temporary suspension order       was timely because it was issued within 90 days of when 

Melvin's period for filing an appeal expired on October 13,            2013.   

 

        The parties cite to no authority interpreting this aspect of the Rule          .  T he relevant statutory

language   does not address the issue     , nor   do the   related proposing or adopting releases.         Thus,

(…continued) 
        We reject this argument.  Both the partner and Melvin were enjoined from antifraud 

violations, which, as we noted above, ordinarily warrants permanent exclusion from participation 

in the securities industry.  Their misconduct was serious for many of the same reasons, and the 

fact that some particulars differed—Melvin misappropriated but didn't trade, his partner traded 

but didn't misappropriate, Melvin tipped four people, his partner tipped one person—does not 

mean that the public interest would mandate that they receive different sanctions.   

        We further find that Melvin deserves no special credit for making the payments he agreed 

to.  Cf., e.g., Howard Braff, Exchange Act Release No. 66467, 2012 WL 601003, at *7 (Feb. 24, 

2012) (for those who agreed to abide by FINRA's rules, compliance with obligations under those 

rules is not a mitigating factor in determining sanctions); Kevin M. Glodek, Exchange Act

         When the Commission adopted the amendment to then                 -Rule 2(e) that made "a

expert from appearing and practicing before the Commission," the amendment contained the 

language currently found in Rule 102(e)(3) that looks to whether "further review or appeal 

procedures are no longer available," among other factors, in d           etermining whether the 

Commission's entry of an order of temporary suspension was timely.                 Suspension or Disbarment

                                                     12 
 

         
        For purposes of Rule 102(e)(3), we interpret the phrase "further review or appeal 
procedures are no longer available" to mean that the party is foreclosed from pursuing further 
review or appeal of his or her case because the time for appeal has expired.  We recognize that 
the application of the language of the rule may be ambiguous where, as here, a party has waived 
the right to an appeal.  Review is arguably "no longer available" in light of a waiver.  But we 
believe the phrase "appeal procedures are no longer available" is better interpreted to refer to the 
procedural availability of the means for bringing an appeal under the federal rules, rather than to 
the viability of any substantive claim that is brought. 
         
        We do not believe it is correct to say that "appeal procedures are no longer available" 
simply because a person has waived the right to appeal in a consent agreement.  Even where such 
a waiver is enforced and an appellate court dismisses the appeal because of the waiver, "appeal 
procedures" are still "available" in the sense that a person is entitled to file the appeal within the 
time provided by the federal rules and to obtain a ruling of some kind from the appellate court.  
Moreover, there are some very limited instances in which an appellate court may decide to reject 
                                               45
a waiver and hear an appeal on the merits.         For these reason  s ,  we  construe the phrase " appeal 
pro cedures are no longer available"     to mean th at  the period allotted by rule for  filing a notice of 
appeal   has expired , without regard to  whether   the right to appeal has been waived in a particular 
case or   to  the validity of any such waiver .  Applying this interpretation, we find that    Federal   Rule 
of Appellate Procedure    4(a)(1)(B) allow   s 60 days for filing an appeal f   ro m a district court's f  inal 
judgment   in which the United States or an agency is a party      , and therefore  , for purposes of Rule 
102(e)(3), appeal procedures were "available" to Melvin         with respect to the Injunctive Order 
                                                         46
within the terms of the rule until that   period ended   .   

                                                  
(…continued) 
from Appearance or Practice Before the Commission, Securities Act Release No. 5147, 1971 
WL 126066, at *2, 4 (May 10, 1971).  There is no discussion of the phrase, "no longer 
available," and subsequent amendments to Rule 102(e) have not clarified the meaning of that 
language.   
45
        Appeal waivers will generally be enforced, absent exceptional circumstances such as the 
lack of actual consent, fra  ud in obtaining consent, or mistake.      See, e.g., Van v. Barnhart, 483 
F.3d 600, 609 & n.5 (9th Cir. 2007) (noting general rule and citing cases that recognize 
exceptions); Mock v. T.G. & Y. Stores Co., 971 F.2d 522, 526-27 (10th Cir. 1992) (affirming 
judgments of district court in favor of defendants where plaintiffs consented to judgment and did 
not reserve the right to appeal).  Where a party has consented to a valid settlement, as Melvin did 
here, courts do not hesitate to enforce provisions expressly waiving the right to appeal.  E.g., 
SEC v. Adair, 549 F. App'x 699 (9th Cir. 2013) (dismissing appeal where litigant had expressly, 
voluntarily, and knowingly waived the right to appeal the district court's order); cf. Throne v. 
Citicorp Inv. Servs., Inc., 378 F. App'x 629, 631-32 (9th Cir. 2010) (affirming district court 
awarding attorneys' fees and costs for appeal where appeal was filed in contravention of express 
waiver). 
46
        While this interpretation works to Melvin's detriment in that it allows the procee         ding 
against him to continue, Melvin cannot credibly argue that his conduct would have been any 
different if he had known when he consented to the settlement of the civil proceeding that we 
                                                                                                 (continued…)

        Melvin argues that the majority of federal courts do not generally consider the merits of 
appeals from consent judgments, and that no applicable exception to this general rule applies in 
                                                         47
this case.  We agree with both of those assertions.           But,  as explained ab ove, this does not mean 
that "appeal procedures    [were]   no longer available"    to Melvin  ;  it simply means that the use of 
those procedures would      very likely  have proved unsuccessful.      
 
        Our interpretation of Rule     102(e)(3) is also supported by policy cons       iderat ions.    W e find 
it preferable  for reasons of efficiency, clarity, and ease of administration, to adopt a bright        -line 
rule that bases the timeliness of    temporary suspension orders in       Rule 102(e)(3)   disciplinary 
proceedings   on  the time for filing a notice of   appeal  .   Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 
4(a)(1)(B)  clearly   sets forth such a deadline,  making it easy to determine when a disciplinary 
proceeding must be brought.  By contrast, Melvin's proposed interpretation of the phrase "no 
longer available"   would   require a case  -by -case analysis as to whether a particular appeal or 
review proceeding would be futile       or unsuccessful    for reasons other than lack of timeliness.       That 
approach would     create   uncertainty over the app  lica tion of our deadlines in particular c   ases.  The 
time for filing an appeal is a more certain and uniform starting point to gauge the running of our 
90 -day period.   
         
        Our approach is also supported by the approach taken by the United States Court of 
                                                                         48
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit i      n Adams v. SEC.    The court there adopted a 
similar bright-line rule that a final disposition of an administrative proceeding became 
"unappealable" for the purpose of determining the timeliness of fee applications under the Equal 
Access to Justice Act only when the statutory period allowed for appeals from such dispositions 
had expired.  The court rejected a rule like the one advanced by Melvin here that would have 

                                                 
(…continued) 
would apply Rule 102(e)(3) in this way.  The consent Melvin signed specifically alluded to the 
possibility of a "disciplinary proceeding before the Commission based on the entry" of the 
Injunctive Order.  Moreover, his argument that Division counsel had discussed the possibility of 
a three-year suspension from practice with him demonstrates that he understood that a 102(e) 
proceeding could follow.  Thus, this is not a situation where a respondent was deprived of fair 
notice of our interpretation of a rule governing the respondent's conduct in a way that impacts the 
fairness of a proceeding.  See, e.g., Marrie v. SEC, 374 F.3d 1196, 1208 (D.C. Cir. 2004) 
(finding that Commission impermissibly applied interpretation to Rule 102(e) retroactively, in 
part because accountants "did not have fair notice [when they engaged in conduct at issue] that 
they could be sanctioned for improper professional conduct even if they had been acting in good 
faith); KPMG, LLC v. SEC, 289 F.3d 109, 116, 126 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (reversing finding that 
"success" fee/royalty arrangement violated AICPA Rule 302 because KPMG "lacked fair notice" 
that the Commission would interpret the rule so as to deem that arrangement to be a prohibited 
contingent fee).  To the contrary, adopting the interpretation Melvin urges would effectively give 
him a windfall, by relieving him of the need to participate in a proceeding that he knew to be a 
likely outcome of his actions.

analyzed whether a particular disposition was specifically appealable based on the standing or 
                                     
lack of standing of the litigant. The court recognized that adopting this bright-line rule, which 
was "discernible by looking at the category of order in question," "eliminate[d] the high potential 
                                                                                                                  49
for confusion" that would have resulted from determining appealability on a case-by-case basis.                       
          
        Melvin also argues that most federal courts hold that a consent judgment is "effective" 
                                                                                                   50
immediately upon entry, and that we should interpret Rule 102(e)(3) the same way.                       We 
understand him to be using "effective" here to mean something              like "binding on the     party  subject 
to the judgment   ."  Indeed, "effective" is used that way elsewhere in Rule 102(e)(3), when the 
rule states that "[a] n order of temporary suspension shall b        ecome effective upon service on the 
               51
respondent.  "     In the case before us,   though, the question is not whether Melvin was bound by 
the injunction as soon as it was entered, but rather when the time for entering an order of 
temporary suspension started to ru       n.  The Rule 102(e)(3) language we must interpret measures 
the time for entering an order of temporary suspension from "            the date on which the final 
judgment or order entered in a judicial or administrative proceeding described in paragraph 
(e)(3)(i)(A) or  (e)(3)(i)(B) of this section has become effective, whether upon completion of 
review or appeal procedures or because further review or appeal procedures are no longer 
available. "   In this context, "effective" means that review or appeal procedures have bee             n 
                                                                                            52
completed or that further review or appeal procedures are no longer available.                     

                                                  
49
        Id.  Several other federal courts of appeals have also adopted a bright-line rule in similar 
circumstances.  See, e.g., Impresa v. Construzioni Geom. Domenica Garufi v. United States, 531 
F.3d 1367, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (adopting a uniform rule for EAJA petitions in the Court of 
Federal Claims in holding that the period for filing an EAJA application started on expiration of 
the period for filing a petition for certiorari from the final judgment of the Federal Circuit 
because "a clear rule better serves the interests of litigants and the court"); Van, 483 F.3d at 612 
(adopting bright-line rule whereby "EAJA's 30-day filing period does not begin to run until after 
the 60-day appeal period in Rule 4(a) has expired," even when a claimant has obtained a 
judgment as to which the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration has consented, in 
part because the possibility that consent judgments can be appealed otherwise could create 
uncertainty and confusion).   

50
        Melvin cites no authority to support this contention.            

51
        17 C.F.R.    §  201.102(e)(3).   

52
        This does not mean      , however, that an order or judgment is not effective or binding            until 
all appeals have been resolved or the period for filing appeals has run. As we have repeatedly 
held, for example, the pendency of an appeal of a civil or criminal proceeding does not justify 
any delay in related "follow     -on" administrative proceeding       s.  See, e.g., Ran H. Furman, 
Exchange Act Release No. 65680, 2011 WL 5231425, at *2 (Nov. 3, 2011) ("Although Furman 
is entitled to appeal the underlying case against him, the possibility of an appeal to the court of 
appeals 'does not alter the effect' of the jury's finding of securities law violations or the court's 
imposition of an injunction here.") (quoting Daniel S. Lezak, Exchange Act Release No. 50729, 
2004 WL 2721400, at *2 & n.16 (Nov. 23, 2004)); Gunderson, 2009 WL 4981617, at *4 ("'[I]t is 
well established that the existence of an appeal of the district court's decision does not affect the 
[permanent] injunction's status as a basis for administrative action.'") (quoting Conrad P. 
                                                                                                      (continued…)

       Melvin engaged in serious misconduct.  He betrayed a longtime client by 
misappropriating sensitive and valuable information that he knew was confidential and sharing it 
with business associates.  Although he did not personally trade on the information, his 
disclosures furthered his professional and personal relationships and led to fraudulent and 
profitable insider trading by at least ten individuals.  Moreover, Melvin does not appear fully to 
appreciate the wrongfulness of his actions, which heightens our concerns about the possibility of 
future misconduct.  In sum, Melvin's actions demonstrate that he poses a threat to the integrity of
