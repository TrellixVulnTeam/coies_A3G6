A. SUMMARY     
 
       This matter involves dozens of violations of the auditor independence rules by an  
accountant who owned and controlled securities in nine audit clients.  Between December 2003 
and July 2008, Thomas P. Flanagan (“Flanagan”), a partner and a Vice Chairman at Deloitte & 
Touche LLP, made 71 trades in which he purchased stock or options in Deloitte audit clients, 62 of 
which were in the securities of audit clients for whom Flanagan was serving on Deloitte’s 
engagement team as the advisory partner.  Flanagan concealed his ownership and control of these 
securities from Deloitte and the audit clients.  During the time Flanagan owned or controlled these 
securities, Deloitte issued audit reports to these nine audit clients in which it stated that the 
financial statements contained in the reports had been audited by an independent auditor.  These 
clients then filed with the Commission annual reports and proxy statements, which included these 
false audit reports. 
 
B.      RESPONDENT

that “[t]he Commission may . . . deny, temporarily  or permanently, the privilege of appearing or 
practicing before it . . . to any person who is found…to have willfully violated, or willfully aided and 
abetted the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or the rules and regulations 
thereunder.”

D. FACTS          
 
Flanagan was Subject to the Commission’s Auditor Independence Rules 
 
12.     At all relevant times, Deloitte was the auditor responsible for the audits or reviews of the 
annual and quarterly financial statements for Allstate, Berkshire Hathaway, Best Buy, CBOT, 
CNA, Sears and its predecessor Sears, Roebuck and Co., ServiceMaster, USG, and Walgreens 
(“collectively, “the Audit Clients”) filed with the Commission.   
 
13.     Flanagan served as the Advisory Partner on Deloitte’s audit engagements with seven of 
the nine Audit Clients, including Allstate from 2003 to 2008; Berkshire Hathaway from 2002 to 
2008; Best Buy from 2005 to 2008; Sears from 2002 to 2008; ServiceMaster from 2003 to 2006; 
USG from 2004 to 2008; and Walgreens from  2003 to 2008 (collectively, “the Flanagan 
Advisory Clients”). 
 
14.     Advisory Partners are assigned by Deloitte to certain clients and play an important role in 
these engagements.  As the Advisory Partner for the Flanagan Advisory Clients, Flanagan, 
among other things, served as a liaison between management and the Deloitte audit engagement 
team, attended Audit Committee meetings, received and had access to nonpublic information 
regarding the Flanagan Advisory Clients’ earnings results and other information, and in some  
cases, participated in the evaluation of the performance of other partners serving that client. 
 
15.     Flanagan was required to comply with the Commission’s auditor independence rules with 
respect to the Flanagan Audit Clients because as the Advisory Partner, he was a “covered 
person” under those rules.  Flanagan was also required to comply with the auditor independence 
rule with respect to CBOT and CNA because by working in the same office as the lead partner 
on those engagements, he was a covered person.

16.     Under the Commission’s auditor independence rules, accountants are not independent as 
to an audit client if, among other things, the accounting firm, or any covered person in the firm, 
or any of his or her immediate family members has a direct investment in the audit client, such as 
stocks, bonds, notes, options, or other securities, or if the accountant serves as the voting trustee 
of a trust containing securities of an audit client. Flanagan knew and understood this rule.   
 
Flanagan Owned or Controlled the Audit Clients’ Securities 
 
17.     Between 2003 and 2008, Flanagan made 71 purchases of stock and options in the 
securities of the Audit Clients.  He made all of these purchases in accounts he owned, in 
accounts he controlled for the benefit of family members, or in a family trust account for which 
he served as trustee.  Flanagan had the authority to make trades in all of these accounts.

Flanagan Concealed His Trading in the Clients’ Securities and Circumvented Deloitte’s 
Independence Compliance System 
 
27.     At all relevant times, Deloitte had policies and quality control procedures in place to 
ensure that its professional personnel maintained their independence relative to Deloitte’s audit 
clients.  Deloitte’s independence policies were primarily contained in Deloitte’s Independence 
Manual.  Deloitte’s Independence Compliance system included the use of computer databases to 
monitor the financial interests of its partners. 
 
28.     Flanagan knew and understood these policies and procedures. 
 
29.     Deloitte’s independence procedures required, among other things, that its professional 
personnel, including partners, self-report all of their securities holdings and trading activities.  
These professionals were also required to report all securities trades that they made as a trustee 
for accounts they controlled.  Deloitte created the Deloitte Entity Search and Compliance system  
(“DESC”) and the Tracking and Trading system  (“Tracking and Trading”) for the employees to 
use to report these transactions. 
 
30.     The DESC contained a “Restricted Entity List,” which contained the names of all 
companies, banks, brokerage firms, and other institutions that Deloitte prohibited employees 
from, among other things, having a financial interest in or maintaining an account.  All of 
Deloitte’s audit clients within the United States, including the Audit Clients at issue here, were 
included in the Restricted Entity List, which Deloitte updated daily.  Prior to making a securities 
trade, Deloitte required employees to access the DESC and Restricted Entity List to verify that 
the company, brokerage firm, or other entity involved in the transaction was not restricted.  After 
completing the transaction, employees had 10 calendar days to report it to Deloitte via Tracking 
and Trading. 
 

                                               6 
 
 
---------------------Page 7---------------------

                                                  
31.     Deloitte also required its employees to file annual Independence Representations in 
which the employees were to affirm between 30 and 50 specific statements.  These statements 
concerned the employee’s financial transactions during the previous year, the employee’s 
understanding of, and compliance with, Deloitte’s independence policies, and other topics.  If the 
employee responded to a statement with anything other than “Agree,” the employee had to 
provide a written explanation, which Deloitte’s Independence and Ethics Compliance Group then 
reviewed. 
 
32.     Flanagan concealed from Deloitte his trades in the Audit Clients’ securities by failing to 
report these trades in the Tracking and Trading System, and thereby circumvented Deloitte’s 
Independence Compliance system.   
 
33.     Flanagan lied to Deloitte about his compliance with Deloitte’s independence policies.  In 
the Independence Representations he filed in 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007, Flanagan falsely 
affirmed that:  
 
       A)      Tracking and Trading accurately reflected the brokerage accounts and financial 
               interests held or controlled by Flanagan; 
       B)      at no time during the representation period did he have a financial interest in a 
               Restricted Entity; and  
       C)      he had not served as a trustee, executor, or administrator of an estate that had a 
               financial interest in a Restricted Entity.   
                   
34.     In fact, Flanagan owned or controlled several brokerage accounts, as well as stocks and 
options that he had not reported in Tracking and Trading.  He also owned or controlled stocks 
and options in Restricted Entities, including the Audit Clients for whom he served as an 
Advisory Partner.  In addition, Flanagan served as the trustee for a family trust and controlled 
brokerage accounts in the name of that trust and in the name of other family members.  Flanagan 
traded in the securities of the Audit Clients in several of these accounts.   
 
35.     Flanagan’s efforts to conceal from Deloitte his trades in the Audit Clients’ securities 
extended to the furnishing of false information in the preparation of his personal income tax 
returns.  He utilized Deloitte Tax LLP (“Deloitte Tax”) to prepare his tax returns.  Flanagan 
provided Deloitte Tax personnel with the names of the securities he purportedly traded during 
the tax year, the trade dates, and his gains or losses.  For the tax years 2004 through 2007, 
Flanagan substituted the names of Deloitte audit clients whose securities he traded in with the 
names of other entities for which he had no trading restrictions.  Between 2004 and 2007, 
Flanagan substituted unrestricted company names for 13 trades that he made in the securities of  
seven of the Audit Clients including Best Buy, CBOT, CNA, Sears, USG, and Walgreens.   
 
Deloitte Represented that it was Independent from the Clients  
 
36.     Deloitte represented that it was independent in the Report of Independent Registered 
Public Accounting Firm (“audit reports”) it provided to these Audit Clients for the audit years 

                                                7

   listed below.  In these reports, Deloitte stated that it had performed the audits in accordance with 
   the standards of the PCAOB. 
    
           A)      Allstate for its fiscal year 2006; 

           B)      Berkshire Hathaway for its fiscal years 2005 and 2006; 

           C)      Best Buy for its fiscal years 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009; 

           D)      CBOT for its fiscal year 2007; 

           E)      CNA for its fiscal years 2003 and 2004;  

           F)      Sears for its fiscal years 2003, 2004, and 2008; 

           G)      ServiceMaster for its fiscal years 2006 and 2007; 

           H)      USG for its fiscal years 2004 and 2007; and 

           I)       Walgreens for its fiscal years 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007. 

    
   37.     The Audit Clients then filed annual reports and proxy statements with the Commission 
   that included Deloitte’s audit reports.  The Audit Clients also filed quarterly reports with the 
   Commission that had been reviewed by Deloitte. 
     
   38.     Deloitte also represented to each of the Audit Clients at the end of each affected fiscal 
   year that it was “independent” within the meaning of the federal securities laws and therefore 
   able to serve as each client’s external auditor.  These written confirmations – commonly called 
   ISB(1) Letters (for Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1, Independence Discussions 
   With Audit Committees) – did not disclose Flanagan’s ownership or control of securities in the 
   client.  Standard No. 1 was carried forward as part of the PCAOB’s interim standards when the 
   ISB ceased operations. 
                                                Violations  
    
   39.     Rule 2-01(c)(1) of Regulation S-X states, in part, that:  
 
                   An accountant is not independent if, at any point during the audit   
                   and professional engagement peri od, the accountant has a direct   
                   financial interest or a material indirect financial interest in the 
                   accountant's audit client, such as: 
                    
                   (i) Investment in audit clients. An accountant is not independent     
                   when: 
    
                          A)  ... any  covered person in the firm , or any of his or her   
                          immediate family members, has any direct investment in an  
                          audit client, such as stocks, [or] options ...; 
                          ... 
                          C) ... any covered person in th  e firm ... serves as voting 
                          trustee of a trust, ... contai  ning the securities of an audit 
                          client, unless the ... covered  person in the firm, ... has no 
                          authority to make investment decisions for the trust or estate. 

                                                     8

   40.     Professional independence standards for accountants and auditors, as set forth in AICPA 
   ET Rule 101.02, and adopted by PCAOB as its interim ethical standards under Rule 3600T, state, 
   in part, that:  
    
                  Independence shall be considered to be impaired if during the period 
                  of the professional engagement a covered member had ... any direct 
                  or material indirect financial interest in the client [or] was a trustee 
                  ... if such trust ... had ... any direct or material indirect financial  
                  interest in the client and the covered member ...had the authority to  
                  make investment decisions for the trust .... 
 
   41.     Flanagan was a covered person as to all of the Audit Clients during the relevant periods. 
    
   42.     Flanagan lacked independence under Rule 2-01(c)(1) of Regulation S-X, PCAOB Rule  
   3600T, and AICPA ET Rule 101.02 when he owned securities in the Audit Clients in accounts he 
   owned, in accounts he controlled for the benefit of family members, and in a family trust account 
   for which he served as trustee.      
    
   43.     Rule 2-02(b)(1) of Regulation S-X requires accountants’ reports to state “whether the audit 
   was made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.” “[R]eferences in 
   Commission rules and staff guidance and in the federal securities laws to GAAS or to specific 
   standards under GAAS, as they relate to issuers, should be understood to mean the standards of the 
   PCAOB . . . .”  SEC Release No. 34-49708.  Thus, an auditor violates Rule 2-02(b)(1) of 
   Regulation S-X if it issues a report stating that it had conducted its audit in accordance with 
   PCAOB standards when it had not.    
    
   44.     As a result of Flanagan’s conduct described above, Deloitte violated Rule 2-02(b)(1) of 
   Regulation S-X.  Deloitte’s audits and interim reviews of  the Audit Clients  were not conducted in  
   accordance with PCAOB standards because Flanagan, a covered person in Deloitte, lacked 
   independence as to those Audit Clients.  Flanagan willfully aided and abetted and caused Deloitte’s 
   violations of Rule 2-02(b)(1) of Regulation S-X. 
    
   45.     Flanagan willfully aided and abetted and caused the Audit Clients’ violations of Section 
   13(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder, which require issuers to file 
   annual reports containing financial statements certified by independent public accountants, and 
   violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 14a-3 thereunder, which require that 
   proxy statements contain financial statements certified by independent public accountants.   
    
   46.     As a result of the conduct described above, Flanagan engaged in improper professional 
   conduct.  For accountants, improper professional conduct includes “intentional or knowing 
   conduct, including reckless conduct that results in a violation of applicable professional standards.”  
   Rule 102(e)(1)(iv)(A).  Flanagan intentionally and knowingly owned and controlled securities of 

                                                   9

Deloitte audit clients while a covered person and thus failed to comply with Rule 2-01(c)(1) of  
Regulation S-X, and violated PCAOB Rule 3600T and AICPA ET Rule 101.02.  
 
                                                 Findings  
 
47.      Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that Flanagan engaged in improper 
professional conduct within the meaning of Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) of the Commission’s Rules of 
Practice. 
         
48.      Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that Flanagan (a) willfully aided and  
abetted and caused Deloitte’s violations of Rule 2-02(b)(1) of Regulation S-X; and (b) willfully 
aided and  abetted and caused the Audit Clients’ violations of Sections 13(a) and 14(a) of the 
Exchange Act, and Rules 13a-1, 13a-13, and 14a-3 promulgated thereunder.  
         
                                                     IV. 
                                                        
        In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in Respondent Flanagan’s Offer. 
 
        Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that:  
 
        A.      Flanagan shall cease and desist from causing any violations and any future violations  
of Sections 13(a) and 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 13a-1, 13a-13, and 14a-3 promulgated 
thereunder and of Rule 2-02(b)(1) of Regulation S-X. 
 
        B.      Flanagan is denied the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission 
as an accountant. 
 
 
 By the Commission.
