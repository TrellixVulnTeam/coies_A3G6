        On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds        that:  
 

A.      SUMMARY 

        This matter concerns violations of the Commission’s auditor independence rules by 
Brace.  Brace audited the annual financial statements that were filed with the Commission for 20 
broker-dealer audit clients for the fiscal years 2010 through 2012.  For at least one audit for two 
of these broker-dealer audit clients during that time period, Brace was not independent under 
auditor independence criteria established by the Commission and made applicable by Exchange 
                                                         4
Act Rule 17a-5(f)(3) to audits of brokers and dealers.       As a result of this conduct, Brace 
engaged in improper professional conduct, violated the auditor independence rules, and caused 
each of the broker -dealers’ failure to file an annual report audited by an independent accountant. 
 
B.      RESPONDENT 

        Respondent Brace, a professional company, is an accounting and auditing firm registered 
with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) with its office in 
Londonderry, New Hampshire.  Brace is a solo practitioner with no administrative staff.   
 

 
                                                           
3
        The findings are made pursuant to Respondent’s Offer of Settlement and are not binding on any other 
person or entity in this or any other proceeding. 
 
4
        The provisions of Exchange Act Rule 17a-5 referred to herein are those in effect during, and applicable to, 
the relevant conduct.  On July 30, 2013, the Commission adopted certain amendments to Rule 17a-5. See Broker-
Dealer Reports, SEC Exchange Act Release No. 34-70073 (July 30, 2013), 78 Fed. Reg. 51910 (Aug. 21, 2013).  
Among other things, the amendments to Rule 17a-5 require that audits of brokers and dealers be performed in 
accordance with Public Company Accounting Oversight Board standards, effective for audits of fiscal years ending 
on or after June 1, 2014.  The auditor independence requirement of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X applied to broker-
dealer audits both before and after the July 30, 2013 amendments.    At the time of the relevant conduct, prior to the 
amendments, that requirement was set out in Rule 17a-5(f)(3).  It is now set out in Rule 17a-5(f)(1).

C.     FACTS 

       1.      Lack of Independence 
        
               a.      During fiscal years 2010 through 2012 (the “Relevant Period”), Brace 
served as the independent public accountant for twenty broker-dealer audit clients.  In connection 
with at least one audit performed for two of those broker-dealer audit clients during the Relevant 
Period, Brace prepared the financial statements and/or notes to the financial statements that were 
filed with the Commission on Form X-17A-5.  
        
               b.      For example, with respect to one of its broker-dealer clients (“Broker-
Dealer A”), Brace audited the annual financial statements for Broker-Dealer A for the fiscal year 
ending 2012.  During the audit, Broker-Dealer A provided Brace with accounting records and 
source data.  Brace reviewed and tested these ledgers and accounts contained therein, as part of the 
audit.  Brace then utilized the information contained in these documents to create and revise a set 
of financial statements to be filed with the Commission.  In particular, Brace typed and updated the 
new set of financial statements, including the notes to the financial statements and the cash flow 
statement.  Brace then provided the financial statements it had prepared to Broker-Dealer A’s 
management for approval. 
        
               c.      In June 2012, Broker-Dealer A filed with the Commission a Form X-17A-5 
Part III for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012.  Included in that filing is an audit report signed 
by Brace and stating, among other things, that Brace’s audit of Broker-Dealer A was conducted “in 
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America.” 
        
               d.      Brace engaged in substantially similar conduct in connection with at least 
one audit for one additional broker-dealer client during the Relevant Period. 
        
       2.      Violations 
 
       a.      Section 17(e)(1)(A) of the Exchange Act requires that every registered broker or 
dealer “annually file with the Commission a balance sheet and income statement certified by an 
independent public accounting firm, or by a registered public accounting firm if the firm is 
required to be registered under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, prepared on a calendar or fiscal 
year basis, and such other financial statements (which shall, as the Commission specifies, be 
certified) and information concerning its financial condition as the Commission, by rule may 
prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.” 
        
       b.      Exchange Act Rule 17a-5(e)(1)(i) states: “An audit shall be conducted by a public 
accountant who shall be in fact independent as defined in paragraph (f)(3) of this section herein, 
and he shall give an opinion covering the statements filed pursuant to paragraph (d) . . . .” 
Exchange Act Rule 17a-5(f)(3) further states that, for such audits, “[a]n accountant shall be 
independent in accordance with the provisions of Rule 2-01(b) and (c) of Regulation S-X.”   
        
       c.      Exchange Act Rule 17a-5(g) requires that “[t]he audit shall be made in accordance 
with generally accepted auditing standards” and Exchange Act Rule 17a-5(i) requires that “[t]he 

                                                 3 
                                                  
---------------------Page 4---------------------

accountant’s report shall . . . [s]tate whether the audit was made in accordance with generally 
accepted auditing standards.”  Generally accepted auditing standards (“GAAS”) require auditors to 
maintain strict independence from their audit clients; an auditor “must be free from any obligation 
to or interest in the client, its management or its owners.”  See Statement on Auditing Standard No. 
1, Section 220.03.  Accordingly, if an auditor’s report states that its audit was performed in 
accordance with GAAS when the auditor was not independent, then it has violated Exchange Act 
Rule 17a-5(i).  See In the Matter of Rosenberg Rich Baker Berman & Company and Brian Zucker, 
CPA, Exchange Act Release No. 69765 at p. 5 (June 14, 2013).   
        
       d.      Rule 2-01(c)(4) of Regulation S-X provides that accountants are not independent if, 
at any point during the audit and professional engagement period, the accountant provides 
prohibited non-audit services to an audit client.  Rule 2-01(c)(4)(i) of Regulation S-X provides that 
prohibited non-audit services include bookkeeping or other services related to the accounting 
records or financial statements of the audit client, and defines such services as:   
        
       Any service, unless it is reasonable to conclude that the results of these services will not be 
       subject to audit procedures during an audit of the audit client's financial statements, 
       including: 
        
           (A) Maintaining or preparing the audit client's accounting records; 
            
           (B) Preparing the audit client's financial statements that are filed with the Commission 
               or that form the basis of financial statements filed with the Commission; or 
            
           (C) Preparing or originating source data underlying the audit client's financial 
               statements. 
        
       e.      Rule 2-01(c)(4)(i) of Regulation S-X specifically prohibits an audit firm from 
preparing an audit client’s financial statements that are filed with the Commission.  In this context, 
preparing financial statements includes but is not limited to:  aggregating line items from internal 
books and records to the financial statements; changing line item descriptions; drafting or editing 
notes to the financial statements; and converting FOCUS reports or bookkeeping software program 
reports into financial statements.  With respect to the audit of Broker-Dealer A and one other 
broker-dealer client, Brace engaged in one or more of the above prohibited actions.  
        
       f.      As a result of Brace’s conduct in preparing the financial statements, including the 
notes thereto, Brace was not independent of its broker-dealer audit clients under the independence 
criteria established by Rule 2-01(c)(4) of Regulation S-X, which Exchange Act Rule 17a-5 made 
applicable to the audits of broker-dealer financial statements.  As the Commission explained in 
adopting Rule 2-01(c)(4), providing such services for an audit client “impairs the auditor’s 
independence because the auditor will be placed in the position of auditing the firm’s work when 
auditing the client’s financial statements. . . .  In addition, keeping the books is a management 
function, the performance of which leads to an inappropriate mutuality of interests between the 
auditor and the audit client.”  Revision of the Commission’s Auditor Independence Requirements,

Commission’s Requirements Regarding Auditor Independence, Exchange Act Release No. 47265 
(“keeping the books is a management function, which also is prohibited”)(January 28, 2003). 
        
               g.     Brace violated Exchange Act Rule 17a-5(i) by representing in its audit 
report that it had performed the audits of the broker-dealers’ financial statements in accordance 
with GAAS when in fact, because of the independence impairment described above, the audit had 
not been performed in accordance with GAAS. 
        
               h.     Exchange Act Section 17(a) and Rule 17a-5 require broker-dealers to file 
annual reports containing financial statements audited by independent public accountants.  No 
showing of scienter is necessary to establish a violation of Exchange Act Section 17(a).  See In the 
Matter of Orlando Joseph Jett, Exchange Act Release No. 49366 at n.45 (March 5, 2004) (citing 
SEC v Drexel Burham Lambert Inc., 837 F. Supp. 587, 610 (S.D.N.Y. 1993); Stead v. SEC, 444 
                    th
F.2d 713, 716-17 (10  Cir. 1971), cert denied, 404 U.S. 1059 (1972)).   
        
               i.      Under Section 21C of the Exchange Act, a person is a “cause” of another’s 
primary violation if the person knew or should have known that his act or omission would 
contribute to the primary violation.  Negligence is sufficient to establish “causing” liability under 
Section 21C when a person is alleged to have caused a primary violation that does not require 
scienter.  In re KPMG Peat Marwick, Exch. Act. Rel. No. 43862 (Jan. 19, 2001), aff’d, KPMG v. 
SEC, 289 F.3d 109 (D.C. Cir. 2002).  
        
               j.     Brace caused its broker-dealer audit clients to violate Exchange Act Section 
17(a) and Rule 17a-5.  Respondent, an audit firm registered with the PCAOB and operated by a  
Certified Public Accountant, knew or should have known that its conduct, including incorrectly 
stating in audit reports that the audits were conducted in accordance with GAAS, contributed to its 
audit clients’ violations of Exchange Act Section 17(a) and Rule 17a-5.        
        
               k.      Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice allows the Commission 
to censure a person if it finds that such person has engaged in “improper professional conduct.”  
Exchange Act § 4C(a)(2); Rule 102(e)(1)(ii).  Rule 102(e) defines improper professional conduct, 
in part, as:  “[a] single instance of highly unreasonable conduct that results in a violation of 
applicable professional standards in circumstances in which the registered public accounting firm 
or associated person knows, or should know, that heightened scrutiny is warranted.”  Exchange Act 
§ 4C(b)(2); Rule 102(e)(1)(iv)(B). 
                
               l.      Questions regarding an auditor’s independence always warrant heightened 
scrutiny.  See Amendment to Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 63 Fed. Reg. 
57,164, 57,168 (Oct. 26, 1998) (codified at 17 C.F.R. Part 201).  The Commission has defined the 
“highly unreasonable” standard as: 
        
       an intermediate standard, higher than ordinary negligence but lower than the traditional 
       definition of recklessness used in cases brought under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act 
       and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act.  The highly unreasonable standard is an objective 
       standard. The conduct at issue is measured by the degree of the departure from professional 
       standards and not the intent of the accountant.

       Id. at 57,167; see also In the Matter of Ernst & Young LLP, Admin. Proc. File No. 3-
10933, SEC Initial Decision Release No. 249, at 60 (Apr. 16, 2004). 
        
              m.      Based on the conduct set forth above, Brace engaged in highly unreasonable 
conduct that resulted in violations of applicable professional standards when it knew or should 
have known that heightened scrutiny was required. 
        
       3.     Findings 
        
       a.     Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that Brace engaged in improper 
professional conduct pursuant to Exchange Act Section 4C(a)(2) and Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) of the 
Commission’s Rules of Practice. 
 
       b.     Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that Brace committed violations of 
Exchange Act Rule 17a-5(i) and caused two broker-dealers’ violations of Section 17(a) and Rule 
17a-5 promulgated thereunder.         
        
       4.     Respondent’s Remedial Efforts and Cooperation 
 
       In determining to accept the Offer, the Commission considered the remedial acts 
undertaken by Respondent and the cooperation afforded the Commission staff.  As part of its 
remediation, Respondent has already implemented or begun to implement some of the 
Undertakings listed below. 
 
       5.     Undertakings 
 
       Brace undertakes: 

       a.      within ninety (90) days from the date of the Order, to establish written policies 
and procedures, or to revise and/or supplement existing written policies and procedures, for the 
purpose of providing Brace with reasonable assurance of compliance with applicable 
independence requirements, including those requirements of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X 
applicable to an SEC Registered Broker-Dealer Engagement (defined to mean an engagement to 
provide a report – whether an audit report, an examination report, or a review report – required 
under Exchange Act Rule 17a-5(d)(1)(i)(C), as amended); 
 
       b.     within ninety (90) days from the date of the Order, to establish a policy of 
ensuring training, whether internal or external, on an annual or more frequent regular basis, 
concerning applicable independence requirements, including those requirements of Rule 2-01 of 
Regulation S-X applicable to an SEC Registered Broker-Dealer Engagement, of any Firm audit 
personnel who participate in any way in the planning or performing of any SEC Registered 
Broker-Dealer Engagement; 
 
       c.      within ninety (90) days from the date of the Order and before Brace’s 
commencement of any SEC Registered Broker-Dealer Engagement (or, where Brace by the date 

                                               6 
                                                 
---------------------Page 7---------------------

of this Order has already commenced but not completed such an engagement, before Brace’s 
release of its report), to ensure training pursuant to the policy described in paragraph (5)(b) 
above has been provided on at least one occasion; 
 
       d.     to provide a copy of the Order –  
 
              (i)     within thirty (30) days from the date of the Order, to all audit personnel 
employed by, or associated with (as defined in PCAOB Rule 1001(p)(i)), Brace as of the date of 
the Order; 
 
              (ii)    within thirty (30) days from the date of the Order, to any client of Brace as 
of the date of the Order for which Brace has performed or has been engaged to perform an SEC 
Registered Broker-Dealer Engagement; and 
 
       e.     to certify in writing to Stephen L. Cohen, Associate Director, Division of 
Enforcement, Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20549-
5553, Brace’s compliance with paragraphs 5(a) through 5(d)(ii) above.  The certification shall 
identify the undertakings, provide written evidence of compliance in the form of a narrative, and 
be supported by exhibits sufficient to demonstrate compliance.  Brace shall submit such 
certification within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of the Order.  Brace shall also 
submit such additional evidence of and information concerning compliance as the staff of the 
Division of Enforcement may reasonably request. 
 
                                              IV. 
 
       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions
