              On the basis of this Order and Respondents Offer, the Commission finds1
                                                                                    that: 
 
                                            Respondent 
 
       Douglas R. Bauer, age 44, of St. Petersburg, Florida, is the chief financial officer, 
secretary, and treasurer of PowerLinx, Inc. (PowerLinx).  He joined PowerLinxs management 
team in early 2001 and shortly thereafter became chief financial officer.    
        
                                      Other Relevant Entity  
 
       PowerLinx is a Nevada corporation based in St. Petersburg, Florida.  The company, 
formerly known as SeaView Video Technology, Inc., manufactures security video cameras, 
underwater cameras, and accessories.  PowerLinxs stock is quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board 
under the symbol PWNX.   
 
                                             Summary 
 
       Bauer joined PowerLinxs management team in early 2001.  Prior to Bauers arrival, 
PowerLinx had fraudulently recognized nearly ninety percent of its reported revenues during fiscal 
year 2000 based on fictitious sales.2
                                      During his initial review of the companys financial records, 
Bauer concluded that PowerLinx had materially overstated revenues and accounts receivable 
during 2000.  In April 2001, largely at Bauers impetus, PowerLinx restated its second- and third-
quarter revenues as part of its fiscal year 2000 annual report on Form 10-K.  In April 2002, 
PowerLinx again restated its financial statements, in its 2001 annual report on Form 10-K, to write 
down improperly recorded deferred tax assets.  At the time of that restatement, Bauer was aware of 
material information that should have been disclosed, but did not cause that information to be 
included in the restatement.  Accordingly, Bauer was a cause of PowerLinxs violations of Section 
15(d) of the Exchange Act and Rules 15d-1 and 12b-20 thereunder with regard to its April 2002 
restatement.    
 

                                                 
1
       The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondents Offer of Settlement and are not binding on any 
other person or entity in this or any other proceeding. 
 
2
       In a related action, PowerLinx and two of its former officers and directors, George S. Bernardich III and 
James R. Cox, have consented to the entry of final judgments enjoining them from violating the antifraud, periodic 
reporting, and recordkeeping provisions and imposing various sanctions.  See Securities and Exchange Commission 
v. PowerLinx, Inc., et al., Civ. Action No. 1172 (D.D.C. filed June 27, 2006).

                                            Background 
                                                    
                            PowerLinxs Improper Revenue Recognition 
 
              From 1999 through 2001 (the relevant period), PowerLinxs business consisted of 
manufacturing and selling underwater video cameras and accessories, and it sold and shipped its 
products directly to consumers, primarily at boat shows.  3
                                                             During fiscal year 2000, PowerLinx 
utilized a sales program known as dealer floor plans, which were, in essence, consignment 
arrangements whereby dealers agreed to display PowerLinxs underwater camera products without 
actually purchasing them (i.e., without accepting title and the risks and rewards of ownership).  In a 
departure from both Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and the companys 
stated revenue recognition policy, which provided for recognition at the time of product 
shipment, PowerLinx recorded revenues from dealer orders placed pursuant to the dealer floor 
plans before any cameras were shipped to dealers or sold by the dealer-consignees to consumers.     4
                                                                                                       
Most of the cameras in question were not shipped, or even manufactured, during the relevant 
period.  However, even if PowerLinx had shipped the cameras on time, the company could not 
have recognized revenue on those shipments in accordance with GAAP because the cameras 
would have been shipped pursuant to consignment arrangements. 
 
              PowerLinxs dealer floor plan program for underwater cameras continued until September 
2000, when the company began soliciting orders for its new SecureView video surveillance 
product, which was still under development at that time.  As the terms of the dealer floor plan 
agreement made clear,  5
                         dealers who submitted orders to participate in SecureView dealer floor 
plans merely were agreeing to display cameras on PowerLinxs behalf, but were not purchasing the 
cameras.  Consequently, the dealer floor plan orders that PowerLinx received did not reflect actual 
demand for the companys products.  From September through at least December 2000, PowerLinx 
devoted virtually all of its marketing and sales efforts toward generating dealer floor plan orders 

                                                 
3
       In late 1999, PowerLinx began developing a video surveillance product known as SecureView, which 
used a camera in a light bulb technology to transmit video signals through electrical wiring to a television monitor.  
During the relevant period, PowerLinx only produced approximately two dozen functioning SecureView cameras, 
primarily prototypes for testing purposes. 
 
4
       Under GAAP, revenue recognition is inappropriate on products delivered pursuant to a consignment 
arrangement, but not yet sold by the consignee, because the consignor retains the risks and rewards of ownership of 
the product and title has not passed to the consignee.  See Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 
48, Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists; Statement of Position (SOP) 97-2, Software Revenue 
Recognition, ¶ 25; Statements of Financial Accounting Concepts (SFAC) 5, Recognition and Measurement in 
Financial Statements of Business Enterprises, ¶¶ 83-84.  Financial statements filed as part of an issuers periodic 
reports under Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act must be prepared in accordance with GAAP.  See 
Regulation S-X §§ 210.4-01, 210.1-01(a)(2). 
 
5
       The consignment agreement that PowerLinx used in connection with its SecureView dealer floor plan 
offered dealers the following terms: ZERO downZERO interestZERO risk.  The consignment agreement 
further provided that [t]he Goods shipped shall remain [PowerLinx]s property until sold to Consignees 
customers, and also that the Consignee shall make payment to [PowerLinx] for Goods sold as soon as practical 
after the sale of each unit on consignment.   
 
                                                  3

for SecureView cameras.  As it had done with the underwater camera dealer floor plans, 
PowerLinx improperly recorded the SecureView orders as sales pr  ior to shipping any cameras and 
before dealers had sold any cameras to customers.  In fact, PowerLinx only manufactured 
approximately two dozen prototype SecureViews in all of 2000 and did not produce commercially 
viable models until May 2001 or later. 
   
                       PowerLinxs 2000 Annual Report and Restatement                           
 
              Bauer joined PowerLinxs management team in early 2001.  During his initial review of the 
companys financial records, Bauer concluded that PowerLinx had materially overstated revenues 
and accounts receivable during 2000.  Bauer immediately conveyed his findings to other members 
of PowerLinxs senior management.  In April 2001, PowerLinx filed its annual report on Form 10-
K for fiscal year 2000.  In that report, PowerLinx restated its financial results for the second and 
third quarters of 2000, but failed to disclose that its accounting errors stemmed from having 
improperly recorded consignment (or dealer floor plan) orders as revenue.    
 
 In addition, PowerLinx       asserted in its Form 10-K that [a]ggressive selling efforts [had] 
achieved approximately $9 million in SecureView product orders from independent retailers and 
individual customers.  (Emphasis added.)  This purported $9 million SecureView backlog was 
also discussed in a December 2000 press release, in which PowerLinx stated, [t]he Company will 
roll into 2001 with a backlog of orders totaling over $9 million.  In fact, the orders comprising 
the purported $9 million backlog were consignment orders and not actual product sales.  By 
representing its dealer floor plan orders as product orders from independent retailers and 
individual customers, PowerLinx created the impression that there was actual demand for 
SecureView cameras and that such demand would translate into future revenue as soon as 
PowerLinx could begin filling the orders.  In fact, there was little, if any, demand for SecureView 
cameras at the time PowerLinx filed its Form 10-K.  As PowerLinxs senior accounting officer, 
Bauer had a role in preparing PowerLinxs annual report for fiscal year 2000 and was aware of this 
disclosure concerning the $9 million order backlog.    
                                                 
                      Bauer Was a Cause of PowerLinxs Issuance of a 
                      Restatement in 2002 That Omitted Material Facts  
                Regarding the Improper Recording of a Deferred Tax Asset 
        
       Under GAAP, a company may record a deferred tax asset based on a reasonable 
expectation that current net tax operating losses will, in future years, offset expected future 
profits, thereby reducing the companys future income tax liability.6
                                                                      However, GAAP requires 
that the deferred tax asset be reduced by a valuation allowance to account for the possibility 
that the company will fail to be profitable as expected. 
 
       PowerLinx improperly recorded on its fiscal year 2000 balance sheet a deferred tax asset 
of $1,439,322 without any valuation allowance.  The tax asset was material, representing almost 
forty percent of PowerLinxs total assets of $3,841,944.  PowerLinx also recorded deferred tax 
                                                 
6
       See SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes.   
   
                                                4 
---------------------Page 5---------------------

assets of $180,613, $72,907, and $44,921, respectively, in its financial statements for the first 
three quarters of 2000.    
 
       PowerLinx did not have a proper basis for recording the deferred tax assets.  The 
company had accumulated significant losses in 2000 and had no historical operating basis from 
which to conclude that it would be profitable in future years.  Underwater camera sales had 
declined significantly and the company had devoted most of its resources to developing its 
SecureView product.  The sole basis for PowerLinxs expectation of future profitability was 
the purported $9 million backlog of SecureView orders, which management assumed would 
generate taxable income; however, this purported backlog, which predated Bauers hiring, did 
not reflect actual demand for SecureView cameras and, consequently, was not a reasonable or 
reliable indicator of future profitability. 
 
       In late 2001, Bauer determined that virtually all of the orders comprising the purported $9 
million backlog contained consignment terms and, therefore, were unlikely to produce taxable 
income.  In April 2002, after hiring a new audit firm, PowerLinx restated its 2000 financial 
results, reducing the value of the deferred tax asset on its balance sheet from $1,439,322 to zero.  
In its restatement, PowerLinx explained that the action was necessary because projections of 
future taxable income d[id] not rise to the more likely than not criteria established in Financial 
Accounting Standard No. 109.  However, PowerLinx failed to disclose the material underlying 
reason for the restatement, which was, as Bauer himself had concluded in an internal 
memorandum, that [i]n no cases did these orders [comprising the backlog] constitute firm, 
contracted future business and, for that reason, they should not have been relied upon as 
evidence of future taxable income.  
 
       Although Bauer had become aware, after PowerLinx had filed its fiscal year 2000 annual 
report, that the purported backlog consisted of orders for consignment arrangements (rather than 
orders to purchase product), he failed to ensure that PowerLinx disclosed this information as part 
of the 2002 restatement.  As chief financial officer, Bauer should have caused PowerLinx to 
disclose that the sole basis for having recorded the deferred tax asset, the purported $9 million 
order backlog, had been determined to be invalid, but he failed to do so. 
 
                                        Legal Analysis 
 
       As a result of the conduct described above, PowerLinx violated, among other provisions, 
Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act and Rules 15d-1 and 12b-20 thereunder, which require 
Exchange Act reporting companies to file accurate annual reports on Forms 10-K and include in 
such reports material information necessary to ensure that statements in the reports are not 
misleading.  In April 2002, PowerLinx filed an annual report with the Commission that omitted 
material facts.   
 
       As a further result of the conduct described above, Bauer was a cause of PowerLinxs 
violations of Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act and Rules 15d-1 and 12b-20 thereunder.

            In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in Respondents Offer. 
 
            Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that Respondent Bauer cease and desist from causing 
any violations and any future violations of Sections 15(d) of the Exchange Act and Rules 15d-1
