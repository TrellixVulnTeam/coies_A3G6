File No. 3-12797 

IN THE MATTER OF RICHARD E. SELLERS, CPA AND LESTER REX 
ANDERSEN, CPA 

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced the 
issuance of an Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings 
Pursuant to Sections 4C and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 102(e) 
of the Commission’s Rules of Practice (Order) against Richard E. Sellers and Lester Rex 
Andersen. 

The Order alleges that Richard E. Sellers (Sellers) and Lester Rex Andersen (Andersen), 
both certified public accountants, knowingly caused their accounting firm, Sellers & 
Andersen, LLC (S&A), to prepare and issue audit reports on the financial statements of 
five reporting companies after October 22, 2003, without first registering S&A with the 
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (Board).  Section 102(a) of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley Act) prohibits accounting firms not registered with 
the Board from preparing or issuing audit reports with respect to any issuer after that 
date.  The Order alleges that, by their conduct, Sellers and Andersen lacked the requisite 
qualifications to represent others and willfully aided and abetted and caused S&A’s 
violations of Section 102(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.   

Based on the above, the Order institutes cease-and-desist proceedings against Sellers and 
Andersen pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), 
as well as proceedings under Section 4C(a)(1) and (3) of the Exchange Act and Rules 
102(e)(1)(i) and (iii) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, to determine whether the 
allegations in the Order are true, whether cease-and-desist orders should be entered against 
Sellers and Andersen and whether they should be censured or denied the privilege of 
appearing or practicing before the Commission as accountants.  The Order directs the 
Administrative Law Judge to issue an initial decision in this matter no later than 300 days 
from the date of service of the Order.
