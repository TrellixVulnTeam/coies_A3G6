                                              II. 

       In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the 
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings 
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these 
proceedings, and the findings contained in Section III.3. below, which are admitted, Respondent 
consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Rule 102(e) 
of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions 
(“Order”), as set forth below.   

                                              III. 

       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that:  

              1.      Nichols, age 47, is and has been a certified public accountant licensed to 
practice in the State of New Jersey.  He served as Controller of AFI Foodservice Distributor, Inc. 
(“AFI”) from 1995 until his termination in March 2002. 

              2.      At all relevant times, AFI, located in Elizabeth, New Jersey, was a subsidiary 
of Performance Food Group Company (“PFG”), a Tennessee corporation headquartered in 
Richmond, Virginia.  PFG was, at all relevant times, engaged in marketing, processing and selling 
food and food-related products to restaurants, hotels, schools, and other businesses and institutions.  
At all relevant times, PFG’s common stock was registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 
12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), and traded on the NASDAQ 
National Market. 

              3.      On July 24, 2007, a final judgment was entered against Nichols, 
permanently enjoining him from future violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange 
Act and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 
13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder, in the civil 
action entitled Securities and Exchange Commission v. Dean A. Nichols, Civil Action Number 04-
641 (HAA), in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.  Nichols was also 
ordered to pay a $25,000 civil money penalty. 

              4.      The Commission’s Complaint alleged, among other things, that during 2000 
and 2001, Nichols made numerous improper accounting journal entries on the books of AFI that, 
because AFI’s accounts were consolidated with those of PFG, caused PFG to file with the 
Commission materially misleading financial statements in its quarterly reports for the quarters 
ended June 30, 2000, September 30, 2000, March 31, 2001 and September 30, 2001.  The 
Complaint alleged that Nichols engaged in a number of improper accounting practices that caused 
PFG to overstate materially its reported net earnings for those quarters.  These practices included, 
among other things, failing to reconcile properly imbalances in various AFI accounts, and making 
improper accounting adjustments in an effort to make the accounts appear to balance.

                                              IV. 

       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
impose the sanction agreed to in Respondent Nichols’ Offer. 

       Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that Nichols is suspended 
from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant. 

       For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.
