Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) against Motorola, Inc. (Motorola or Respondent).

                                               III. 
         On the basis of this Order and Respondents Offer, the Commission finds  1
                                                                                   that:  
                                                 
A.     Summary 
                                                 
       1.     This case involves a round-trip of cash between Motorola and Adelphia 
Communications Corporation (Adelphia).  Pursuant to a purported marketing support agreement 
entered into in 2001, Adelphia paid money to Motorola which was immediately returned to 
Adelphia in the form of marketing support payments.  No marketing was specified in the 
agreement and no marketing was done pursuant to the agreement.  Adelphia used Motorolas 
marketing support payments to falsify its earnings in 2000 and 2001. 

       2.     In the Fall of 2000, Adelphia, a cable television system owner and operator, asked 
Motorola, a vendor that provided digital cable television set-top boxes used by Adelphia, to enter 
into a marketing support agreement for the stated purpose of helping Adelphia fund its roll-out of 
digital cable television service.  Adelphia proposed to pre-fund Motorolas marketing support 
payment obligation through a retroactive and offsetting price increase applied to digital cable 
television set-top boxes Motorola had supplied Adelphia in the past and was to supply Adelphia in 
the future pursuant to a pre-existing purchase contract. 

       3.     The marketing support agreement, which was not finalized until March 2001, was 
backdated to the prior fiscal year and applied retroactively to set-top boxes that had already been 
sold to Adelphia.  The agreement also contained a false reason for the retroactive price increase.   

       4.     The transaction had no economic substance, amounting to a round-trip of cash, and 
was designed by Adelphia to increase artificially its Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, 
and Amortization (EBITDA) by reducing operating costs by the amount of the marketing support 
payments from Motorola.  In this manner, Adelphia was able to use the transaction to reduce 
improperly its operating costs and increase its earnings by approximately $18.3 million in 2000 
and $28 million in 2001. 

       5.     Motorola knew or should have known that Adelphia was misusing the marketing 
support agreement.  The marketing support agreement was backdated to a prior fiscal year, it 
applied retroactively to set-top boxes that had already been sold to Adelphia, and it contained a false 
reason for the price increase.  Motorola executives also knew that (i) the marketing support 
agreement did not identify any marketing to be done by Adelphia and Motorola did not require that 
any marketing be done pursuant to the agreement; (ii) the transaction was a round-trip transfer of 
cash; and (iii) Motorola accounted for the transaction as economically neutral to Motorola.

other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

B.     Respondent 

       6.     Motorola is a Delaware corporation, with corporate headquarters in Schaumburg, 
Illinois.  Motorola is a global manufacturer and seller of wireless, broadband, and automotive 
communications technologies.  At all relevant times, Motorolas common stock was registered 
with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and was publicly traded on 
the New York Stock Exchange.   

C.     Relevant Entity

       7.     Adelphia is a Delaware corporation, headquartered in Greenwood Village, 
Colorado.  During the relevant period, Adelphia was headquartered in Coudersport, Pennsylvania.  
Adelphia owns, operates, and manages cable television systems and other related 
telecommunications businesses.  On March 27, 2002, Adelphia announced that it was liable for 
approximately $2.3 billion in debt that it had previously failed to disclose.                      In May 2002, certain 
members of the Rigas family, who controlled and held officer and director positions with 
Adelphia, resigned and Adelphia disclosed that it expected to restate its financial statements for 
fiscal years 2000 and 2001.  On July 18, 2002, the Commission filed SEC v. Adelphia 
Communications Corporation, et al., 02 Civ. 5776 (PKC) (S.D.N.Y.), alleging that widespread, 
multifaceted financial fraud occurred at Adelphia.  On May 31, 2005, the U.S. District Court for 
the Southern District of New York entered a consent order enjoining Adelphia from violating 
Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of 
the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 under the Exchange Act. 

D.     Facts

Background 

       8.     In January 2000, Motorola acquired General Instrument Corporation (General 
Instrument) for $17 billion in stock.  General Instrument was integrated into Motorola as its 
broadband communications sector and was a major supplier of digital cable television set-top 
boxes to Adelphia both prior to and after its integration into Motorola.  In fiscal year 2000, the 
sectors earnings accounted for approximately 43% of the combined earnings reported by all of 
Motorolas profitable sectors in that year.    

       9.     In May 2000, Adelphia and Motorola entered into a purchase agreement that 
governed the pricing of digital cable television set-top boxes through December 2001 based upon 
the contemplated purchase by Adelphia of 1.6 million set-top boxes over the life of the contract.  
The purchase agreement did not require Adelphia to purchase any set-top boxes and it did not 
provide for a penalty if Adelphia purchased less than the 1.6 million set-top boxes contemplated by 
the agreement.    

       10.    In June 2000, Adelphia realized that its second quarter reported EBITDA would fall 
below analysts expectations.  Adelphia executives devised a plan to inflate artificially EBITDA by 
reducing operating costs through the purported marketing support agreement with Motorola. 

                                               3 
---------------------Page 4---------------------

       11.    In late August 2000, Adelphia approached Motorola with the idea of entering into 
the marketing support agreement.   

Key Factors That Should Have Put Motorola On Notice That Adelphia Was Not Using The 
Marketing Support Agreement For Its Intended Purpose 

       12.    Between August 2000 and March 2001, when the marketing support agreement 
documents were signed, the executives who reviewed, or were told the substance of, the proposed 
transaction, were confronted with the following unusual facts unique to this transaction:   
 
   •  Adelphias request was the first time any customer had asked the Motorola executives to 
increase the price of Motorolas products; 
 
   •  The marketing support agreement, which Adelphia provided to Motorola, contained a false 
reason for the price increase;  
 
   •  Motorola executives insisted as a condition to entering into the transaction that Adelphia 
provide a letter from its counsel that Adelphia would not use the transaction in contravention of  
federal regulations governing cable television rates.  Instead, an Adelphia finance executive who 
was later implicated in Adelphias fraud sent a short confirmatory letter to Motorola without 
advising Motorola whether its counsel had been consulted;  
 
   •  The marketing support agreement did not contain any details of marketing to be done by 
Adelphia and required no input from Motorolas marketing department;   
 
   •  The marketing support agreement was backdated and the price increase and marketing 
support payment obligation were made retroactive to the beginning of the prior fiscal year and 
applied to products that had already been sold to and paid for by Adelphia; 
 
   •  The transaction was a wash transaction with no economic impact on Motorola; and  
 
   •  Motorola did not treat the transaction as a marketing transaction for accounting purposes.                                          
 
Motorola Asked Adelphia To Purchase More Set-Top Boxes Than Adelphia Needed In 
Exchange For Signing The Marketing Support Agreement 
 
       13.    Shortly before the marketing support agreement was due to be signed in March 
2001, Adelphias orders for set-top boxes declined below the number called for under the May 
2000 purchase agreement.  Motorola knew that Adelphia did not need any additional set-top boxes 
at that time, but told Adelphia that it wanted Adelphia to purchase 100,000 additional set-top 
boxes.  Adelphia agreed to make the purchase before the marketing support agreement was signed 
and before the close of Motorolas first quarter for fiscal year 2001.

Motorola Signed The Backdated Marketing Support Agreement And Made A Retroactive 
Marketing Support Payment  
 
       14.    On or about March 21, 2001, Motorola signed the marketing support agreement 
documents that were backdated to the prior fiscal year.  The marketing support agreement did not 
specify any marketing to be done by Adelphia and it contained a false reason for the price increase.  
In the document memorializing the price increase, Motorola stated falsely that the purpose of the 
price increase was to secure incremental component volumes and factory capacity to meet 
Adelphias needs.  In fact, Motorola executives knew that the true purpose of the price increase was 
to pre-fund Motorolas marketing support payment obligation to Adelphia.     

       15.    In May 2001, Motorola made the first $18.3 million marketing support payment for 
marketing purportedly done in 2000.  The payment was funded by Adelphia three days earlier 
when it paid Motorola the retroactive price increase on set-top boxes previously purchased by 
Adelphia in 2000.      
 
Motorola Again Asked Adelphia To Purchase More Set-Top Boxes Than It Needed And 
Defrayed The Costs Of Warehousing The Boxes In A Third-Party Warehouse In Exchange 
For Maintaining The Marketing Support Agreement 
 
       16.    In early June 2001, Adelphia told Motorola that it would be reducing its orders of 
set-top boxes due to decreased demand.  Motorola knew that Adelphia had excess inventory that 
would carry it to the middle of the following year.  Nevertheless, Motorola insisted that Adelphia 
purchase an additional 150,000 set-top boxes.  Motorola proposed to finance the purchase through 
Motorola Credit Corporation, so that Adelphia would be able to pay for the additional set-top 
boxes in two installments over a period of one year and Motorola would be able to record the sales 
before the close of its second fiscal quarter.   
 
       17.    To implement the deal and protect Motorola, Motorola insured the Adelphia 
receivable.  Motorola knew or should have known that Adelphia did not actually need any 
additional set-top boxes, so it offered Adelphia credits that could be used for other Motorola 
services, including marketing, to offset the cost of warehousing the 150,000 set-top boxes in a 
third-party warehouse.  Adelphia agreed to purchase the additional set-top boxes before the close 
of Motorolas second quarter for fiscal year 2001.    
 
Motorola Agreed To Increase Its Marketing Support Payment Obligation In Exchange For 
Adelphias Agreement To Purchase More Set-Top Boxes In 2002 
 
       18.    In mid-December 2001, at the end of Adelphias fiscal year, Adelphia asked 
Motorola to amend the marketing support agreement to require that Motorola make an additional 
$10 million marketing support payment for 2001 funded by an another retroactive price increase 
on set-top boxes previously delivered to Adelphia.  Motorola agreed to the amendment after 
Adelphia agreed to purchase 200,000 set-top boxes in 2002.  The amended marketing support 
agreement contained the same false reason for the price increase that the original agreement 
contained.   
 
                                              5

Adelphia Used The Marketing Support Agreement To                                                    
Artificially Decrease Marketing Expenses And Increase EBITDA 

       19.    Adelphia recorded the marketing support payments as a contra-expense to 
marketing costs.  This accounting treatment lowered the amount of recorded marketing expenses 
and, in turn, artificially inflated Adelphias EBITDA.  Adelphia recorded the price increases paid 
to Motorola as capital expenditures, which are depreciated over time and, therefore, have no 
impact on EBITDA and a minimal impact on earnings.   

       20.    In total, from April 2000 through December 2001, Adelphia recorded improperly 
approximately $46.3 million in marketing support payments as reductions in current operating 
expenses, with the intended effect of inflating its reported EBITDA by $46.3 million over that 
period.  Adelphias accounting treatment violated Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 
(GAAP) because it reflected the round-trip transaction as decreasing its reported expenses and 
increasing its reported earnings when it did not have that effect.     

Legal Analysis 

       21.    The Exchange Act and Exchange Act rules require every issuer of registered 
securities to file reports with the Commission that accurately reflect the issuers financial 
performance and provide other true and accurate information to the public. 

       22.    Adelphia violated Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1, 13a-13, and 12b-20 by filing with 
the Commission reports from April 2000 through December    2001, each containing materially false 
and misleading earnings in the financial statements for each reporting period. 

       23.    Adelphia violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) by improperly recording the marketing 
support payments as a contra-expense to Adelphias marketing costs, and by recording as capital 
expenditures the artificial price increase on the set-top boxes.  Certain officers of Adelphia 
knowingly falsified, and caused others to falsify, Adelphias books, records and accounts, 
including the fraudulent journal entries of the price increases and marketing support payments.   

       24.    Section 21C of the Exchange Act provides that the Commission may issue a cease-
and-desist order against a person who is a cause of [another persons] violation, due to an act or 
omission the person knew or should have known would contribute to such violation. 2
                                                                                      Based on 
the conduct described above, Respondent was a cause of Adelphias violations of Sections 13(a) 
and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 of the Exchange Act.   
                                                                                               

                                                 

                                                 
                                                 
2
             Where the primary violations underlying a finding that a person is a cause of violations 
do not themselves require a finding of scienter, the standard of liability for being a cause of such 
violations under Section 21C of the Exchange Act is negligence. See KPMG LLP v. SEC, 289 F. 
3d 109, 112 (DC Cir. 2002).

        In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanction 
agreed to in Respondents Offer. 

              Accordingly, pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, it is hereby ORDERED that: 

        A.     Respondent cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any 
future violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 
and 13a-13 thereunder.  

        B.      Respondent is herby ordered pursuant to Section 21C(e) of the Exchange Act to pay 
disgorgement in the amount of $18 million and prejudgment interest in the amount of $7 million, 
for a total payment of $25,000,000.  Within 10 days of entry of this Order, Motorola shall deliver 
this payment into the Registry of the Court for the United States District Court for the Southern 
District of New York in the case captioned Securities and Exchange Commission v. Adelphia 
Communications Corp., et al., 02 Civ. 5776 (PKC).  Simultaneously, Motorola shall transmit by 
hand delivery to the Clerk of the Court, United States District Court for the Southern District of 
New York, a letter specifying that the payment is made in connection with the Commissions 
administrative proceeding and a copy of the letter shall be simultaneously transmitted by facsimile 
to Alistaire Bambach, Assistant Regional Director, Division of Enforcement, Securities and 
Exchange Commission, Northeast Regional Office, 3 World Financial Center, New York, NY 
10281 (212) 336-1324 (facsimile).  In accordance with Rule 1102 of the Commissions Rules of 
Practice [17 C.F.R. 201.1102], the procedures set forth herein shall govern the distribution of any 
funds paid pursuant to this Order.
