       In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondents have submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (“Offer”), which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the purpose 
of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the Commission, or to

to the Commission’s jurisdiction over them and the subject matter of these proceedings, which are

                                               III. 

       On the basis of this Order and Respondents’ Offer, the Commission finds  3
                                                                                  that: 

A.     RESPONDENTS 

       1.        Bray & Associates CPA’s LLC (the “Firm”) is an Indiana limited liability 
company headquartered in Greencastle, Indiana.  The Firm audited Alanar Real Estate Investment 
Trust Series 1 Corporation’s (“Alanar”) balance sheet as of May 19, 2004.   

       2.        Arnold David Bray, CPA, (“Bray”), 59, of Greencastle, Indiana, is a certified 
public accountant licensed in the state of Indiana since 1977.  Bray was the engagement partner in 
connection with the Firm’s audit of Alanar’s balance sheet as of May 19, 2004.   

B.     FACTS 

       1.      Alanar is an Indiana corporation with its headquarters in Sullivan, Indiana.  As of 
May 19, 2004, Alanar reported total assets of $200,000.   

       2.      Alanar has at all relevant times been an issuer as defined by the Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act of 2002 (the “Act”). 

       3.      The Firm audited Alanar’s balance sheet as of May 19, 2004, which was included 
in Alanar’s registration statement on Form S-11/A, filed with the Commission on September 15, 
2004.  As part of that audit, the Firm prepared and issued an audit report dated May 20, 2004 (the 
“Alanar audit report”), which the company included in its Form S-11/A.  Alanar paid the Firm 
$800 for the audit work.4 

3 
       The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondents’ Offer of Settlement and are not binding on any 
other person or entity in this or any other proceeding. 
4 
       During the course of the Commission’s investigation, the Firm voluntarily reimbursed Alanar the $800 in 
audit fees.  In view of the Firm’s reimbursement, the Commission is not ordering disgorgement in this matter. 

                                                2

---------------------Page 3---------------------

       4.      At the time the Firm issued the Alanar audit report, it was not registered with the 
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the “Board”), as required by Section 102(a) of the 
Act. 

       5.      Bray was the engagement partner on the Firm’s audit of Alanar’s balance sheet as 
of May 19, 2004. Bray participated in the preparation and issuance of the Alanar audit report. 

C.     VIOLATIONS 

       1.      Section 102(a) of the Act provides that “it shall be unlawful for any person that is 
not a registered public accounting firm to prepare or issue, or to participate in the preparation or 
issuance of, any audit report with respect to any issuer.”5 

       2.      The provisions of Section 102(a) of the Act became effective on October 22, 2003.      6 

       3.      Based on the conduct described above, the Firm willfully    7
                                                                             violated Section 102(a) 
of the Act. 

       4.      Based on the conduct described above, Bray caused the Firm’s violation of Section 
102(a) of the Act. 

D. FINDI       NGS 

       Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that the Firm willfully violated Section 
102(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and that Bray caused the Firm’s violation of Section 
102(a) of the Act. 

E.     UNDERTAKING 

       Respondents have undertaken not to request, demand, or accept, directly or indirectly, any 
compensation from Alanar in connection with the audit work associated with the Alanar audit 
report. In determining whether to accept the Offer, the Commission has considered this 
undertaking. 

5 
       A violation of the Act or any rule that the Board issues under the Act is treated for all purposes in the same 
manner as a violation of the Exchange Act, including with respect to penalties.  Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 15 
U.S.C.A. § 7202(b)(1) (West 2002). 
6 
       Section 102(a) became effective “[b]eginning 180 days after the date of the determination of the 
Commission under Section 101(d)” of the Act that the Board was prepared to undertake its statutory responsibilities.  
The Commission made the required determination on April 25, 2003.  See Order Regarding Section 101(d) of the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Securities Act Release No. 8223, Exchange Act Release No. 47746, 2003 WL 
1956164  (Apr. 25, 2003). 
7 
       “Willfully” as used in this Order means intentionally committing the act that constitutes the violation. 
There is no requirement that the actor also be aware that he is violating a rule or statute.  See Wonsover v. SEC, 205 
F.3d 408, 414 (D.C. Cir. 2000); Tager v. SEC, 344 F.2d 5, 8 (2d Cir. 1965).

                                              IV. 

       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in Respondents’ Offer. 

       Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that: 

       1.     Bray & Associates CPA’s LLC

any future violations of Section 102(a) of the Act. 

              B.      Bray may practice before the Commission as an independent accountant 
provided that: 

                      1.     The public accounting firm with which he is associated is registered 
with the Board in accordance with the Act, and such registration continues to be effective; and 

                      2.     He has submitted to the Commission staff (attention: Office of the
