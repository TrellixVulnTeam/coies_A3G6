                                              II. 

       In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the 
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings 
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these 
proceedings, and the findings contained in Sections III.3 below, which are admitted, Respondent 
consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Rule 102(e) 
of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions 
(“Order”), as set forth below.   

                                              III. 

       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that:  

       1.     Budilov, age 51, has been a certified public accountant licensed to practice in the 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  His license to practice was issued in March 1981 and it expired 
on April 20, 2000.  During the period of the conduct alleged in the Commission’s complaint, 
discussed more fully below, Budilov was a licensed certified public accountant.  In addition, he 
served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Ambassador Eyewear Group, Inc. from 1995 
until he was terminated from those positions in 1999. 

       2.     Ambassador Eyewear Group, Inc. (“Ambassador”) was, at all relevant times, a 
Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  At all 
relevant times, Ambassador’s common stock was registered with the Commission pursuant to 
Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), and traded on both the 
Chicago Stock Exchange and in the Pink Sheets. 

       3.     On September 26, 2002, the Commission filed a complaint against Budilov in the 
United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania,  SEC v. Barry M. Budilov et 
al. (Civil Action No. 02-CV-7479).  On September 13, 2007, the Court entered an order 
permanently enjoining Budilov, by consent, from future violations of Section 17 of the Securities 
Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 
thereunder, and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the 
Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.

  4.          The Commission’s complaint alleged, among other things, that, from at least 1997 
 through at least December 1998, Budilov engaged in a fraudulent scheme to artificially inflate 
 Ambassador's assets, income, and retained earnings.  As a result of the scheme, the complaint 
 alleged that Ambassador falsely claimed, in a registration statement, annual and quarterly reports 
 filed with the Commission, and in press releases, that it was profitable when, in fact, the 
 company had incurred substantial losses.  In addition, Ambassador overstated its assets by as 
 much as 35 percent.  The Commission's complaint alleged that, as part of the scheme, Budilov 
 falsified Ambassador's books and records related to income, expense, accounts receivable, 

                                               2

 retained earnings, and inventory, and lied to Ambassador's auditor. The complaint further alleged 
 that, after others began suspecting the fraud, Budilov attempted to conceal his involvement by 
 destroying evidence, causing others to destroy evidence, and persuading others to accept 
 responsibility for the fraud.  

                                              IV. 

       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
impose the sanction agreed to in Respondent Budilov’s Offer. 

       Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that Budilov is suspended 
from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant.

 By       the Commission.
