                                                I. 
 
       The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the 
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against Mark C. 
Northrop (“Respondent” or “Northrop”) pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(i) of the Commission’s Rules 
           1

                                               II. 
 
       In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the 
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings 
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these 
proceedings, and the findings contained in Section III.2 below, which are admitted, Respondent 
consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Rule 102(e) 
of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions 
(“Order”), as set forth below.   
 
                                               III. 
                                                  
       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that: 
 
       1.      Respondent, age 67, has been a licensed certified public accountant since April 26, 
1983.    Respondent  maintains  and  exercises  ultimate  authority  over  Kingdom  Legacy  General 
Partner, LLC (“KLGP”).  Since at least December 2010, Northrop and KLGP were unregistered 
investment advisers to Kingdom Legacy Fund (“KLF”) and the various interests offered in KLF, 
known as the “Kingdom Share Classes.” 
 
       2.      On June 6, 2017, a final judgment was entered by consent against Respondent, 
permanently enjoining him from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities 
Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, 
and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8(a) thereunder, in 
the civil action entitled Securities and Exchange Commission v. Kingdom Legacy General 
Partner, LLC, et al., Case No. 16-cv-00441-SPC-MRM, in the United States District Court for 
the Middle District of Florida.  Respondent was also ordered to pay $3,315,727.64 million in 
disgorgement, $515,188.59 in prejudgment interest, and a $320,000 civil penalty, jointly and 
severally with KLGP.  
 
       3.      The Commission’s Amended Complaint alleged that between December 2010 and 
September 2015, Northrop and his alter-ego, KLGP, conducted an offering fraud in which 
Northrop and KLGP secretly charged KLF investors undisclosed fees of either 40% or 50% of 
the trading profits over-and-above the disclosed fees.  As a result of this conduct, Northrop, 
KLGP, and other Northrop-controlled entities obtained more than $3 million to which they were 
not entitled.  The Amended Complaint also alleges KLGP and Northrop made other material 
misrepresentations to investors, falsely claiming that (a) Northrop had a long-standing successful 
investing track record, (b) Northrop’s family was the largest investor in KLF, and (c) the 
Northrop family only made money when investors made money. 

                                                                                                                                                             
the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or of the rules and regulations 
thereunder.

                                                IV. 
                                                  
        In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
impose the sanction agreed to in Respondent Northrop’s Offer. 
 
        Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that Northrop is suspended 
from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant.   
 
        
       By the Commission.
