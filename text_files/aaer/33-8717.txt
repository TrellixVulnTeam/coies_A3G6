                                                III. 
                                           FINDINGS 
 
              The Commission makes the following findings2
                                                       : 
 
       A.     RESPONDENTS 
        
       Walco, based in Westlake, Texas, is the largest  food animal health products distributor in 
North America, with over $600 million in annual revenues. 

 Robison      , age 49, has served as chairman, CEO, and presiden   t of Walco since May 1997. 
 
       B. RELATED PARTIES              
 
       Virbac Corporation (Virbac or the Company), a Delaware corporation headquartered 
in Fort Worth, Texas, is the result of the March 1999 acquisition of Agri-Nutrition Group Limited 
(AGNU), a publicly held company, by Virbac Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Virbac S.A., a 
French veterinary pharmaceutical manufacturer.  Virbacs common stock is registered with the 
Commission under Section 12(g) of  the Exchange Act and trades in the Pink Sheets under the 
symbol VBAC since it was delisted from the NASDAQ National Market on January 23, 2004 for 
Virbacs failure to file timely its periodic reports. 
 
       Thomas L. Bell, age 45, served as president and CEO of Virbac from April 1999, as well as 
a director from May 2002, until he resigned effective January 27, 2004. 

       Joseph A. Rougraff, age 46, and a CPA licensed in the state of Indiana, served as vice 
president, CFO, and corporate  secretary of Virbac fr om May 2000 until he resigned effective 
January 27, 2004.   

 Douglas A. Hubert                    , age 38, joined Virbac in March 1991 as a sales territory manager and 
served as vice president of the Veterinary Division from April 2000 until his resignation in January 
2005.   
 
 C. FACTS              
 
               1. Background     

       Shortly after the March 1999      merger of Virbac, Inc. with AGNU, Bell was named 
Virbacs CEO.  Primarily through the introduction of new products, Virbacs revenues grew from 
$44 million in 1999 to $64 million in 2002.  From January 2000 through September 2002, Bell, in 

                                                                                                                                                             
2
               The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondents Offer and are not binding on any other person or entity 
in these or any other proceedings.

press releases and conference calls, consistently  expressed confidence that the Company would 
achieve its strategic goal of more than doubling revenues to $100 million by 2004.  Together with 
Rougraff, Bell touted positive ear  nings results in press releases, investor presentations, and 
conference calls which they attributed primarily     to successful product launches.  Virbacs 
Veterinary Division, the larges   t of its three repo   rtable segments, which accounted for 
approximately 50% of Virbacs co nsolidated revenue, was portrayed  as the principal driver of 
the Companys growth and success. 
 
       Virbacs stock price rose in response to the Companys favorable operating results and Bell 
and Rougraffs upbeat statementsfrom $1.1 25 on March 5, 1999 to $8  .35 on November 12, 
2003. The November 12 price peak immediately   preceded Virbacs announcement of delay in 
filing its third quarter 2003 Form   10-Q.  Within two weeks of       this announcement, Virbac 
confirmed it would be restating its financial statements. Virbacs stock price tumbledfrom $8.35 
per share on November 12, 2003, when Virbac disclosed delays in filing its Form 10-Q, to $2.70 
on February 20, 2004, when Virbac disclosed the Commissions investigation. 
 
               2.           Elements of the Scheme 
        
       To foster the illusion of rapid revenue and ea rnings growth, Virbac orchestrated a multi-
pronged scheme to manipulate Virbacs financial statements.  The scheme involved, among other 
things: 1) accelerating revenue  recognition on shipments  of product that exceeded distributors 
current demands (i.e., Virbacs loading cycle); 2) recognizing revenue on sham transactions; 3) 
failing to cut off sales at fiscal period-end; and 4) deferring expenses, principally by manipulating 
reserves and accruals. 
 
             Bell and Hubert were able to convince two distributors, one of which was Walco, to 
assist in the activity.3
                        Walcos primary motivation for assisting Virbac was its ambition to gain 
Virbacs warehousing and shipping outsourcing business. 
 
               3.         Walco and Robisons Participat    ion in the Revenue Inflation and 
                      Expense Deferral Scheme 
 
       In early 1999, Virbac began l oading its distributors to meet Bells sales and income 
targets and to fulfill its mission statement: double-digit earnings growth through successful product 
launches.  Virbac relied heavily upon Walco and another distributor to execute its loading strategy, 
granting whatever concessions were necessary to  make sales in excess of distributors current 
requirements.  In some instances, Virbac offe red unusually long payment termsoften 180 days 
or more instead of a more typical 30 daysor even  consignment terms to distributors.  On other 
occasions, various volume discounts and rebates were  given to induce large purchases.  In many 
cases, Virbac promised distributors that they co uld simply return large  quantities of product for 
full credit, or exchange it for replacement product,   at a later date.  These terms were rarely 

                                                                                                                                                             
3
                The two distributors accounted for 90% of the invoices that Virbac used to inflate its revenue.

---------------------Page 4---------------------

reflected in Walcos purchase orders to Virbac.  Through these distributor enticements, Virbac 
improperly recorded revenue in violation of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).      4
        
       Virbacs most excessive loading involved new product launches, such as Preventic Plus 
(flea and tick collar), Iv erhart Plus (heartworm  medication), and its generic ivermectin pour-on 
products (cattle de-wormers).  During 2001, Virb       ac entered into devel opment, license, and 
supply agreements whereby it granted Walco, and two other distributors,   exclusive distribution 
rights to its pour-on product line.5
                                      In the third quarter of 2001, Virbac recognized $900,000 of 
revenue from Walcos purchase of pour-on which  it should not have recognized at that time 
because it was a consignment sale.  Despite th      is fact, Walco furthered Virbacs activity by 
submitting a purchase order that disguised this consignment as a sale with fixed payment terms.   
        
       At the end of 2001, with Virbac facing a reve  nue shortfall, Bell c onvinced Robison to 
have Walco purchase another $800,000 of pour-on products.  Walcos additional purchase of this 
product was unusual in a number of ways.  First, Walco had not sold any of the $900,000 of 
pour-on shipped at the end of September 2001.  Wa lco, at Bells request, sent a purchase order 
with 120-day payment terms while simultaneously en tering into an undiscl osed side agreement 
with Bell pursuant to which payments were not         required until Walco   sold the product.  In 
addition, both Virbac and Walco knew that Walco         was contractually unable to sell Virbacs 
pour-on products, which have a limited shelf life,   until it terminated an  exclusive distribution 
agreement with another manufacturer, which did not occur until the second quarter of 2002. 
        
       In addition to improperly ac celerating revenue recognition on actual tr ansactions, Virbac 
improperly recognized revenue on sham transactions fabricated by Virbac management.  At the end 
of the fourth quarter of 2002, Bell conceived and implemented a scheme to inflate Virbacs revenue 
by shipping $560,000 of Iverhart Plus to Paragon Logistics (Paragon), a division of Walco.  The 
transaction was falsely documented in Virbacs books and records, as well as in Walcos purchase 
order, as a sale to Walco.  Bell separately negotiated an arrangement with Robison whereby Virbac 
would have Paragon ship the product to other customers and Virbac would pay Paragon a logistics 
fee for warehousing and freight costs.  By accepting the shipment and improperly documenting the 
purchase order, Walco and Robison assisted Bell in inflating Virbacs revenue.  The Virbac scheme 
failed; ultimately, the entire shipment expired, no replacement product was shipped, and Virbac was 
forced to issue a credit to Walco for the entire invoice amount.  Bell admitted that not all the terms 
of the Paragon transaction had been finalized by December 31, 2002.  Hubert admitted that Bells 
determination to recognize reve nue on this half-baked trans action was ill-advised because no 
customer was obligated to purchase the product that Virbac had stuffed into a logistics warehouse. 

                                                                                                                                                             
4
               GAAP requires the following criteria  for revenue recognition: 1) persuasive evidence that an arrangement 
exists; 2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; 3) the seller's price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; 
and 4) collectibility is reasonably assured.  See, e.g., Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 48 (FAS 48); 
Statements of Financial Accounting Concepts Nos. 2 a nd 5 (SFAC 2 and SFAC 5); and Accounting Research 
Bulletin No. 43 (ARB 43). 
 
5
              Prior to the introduction of the pour-on product line, Virbac focused exclusively on the pet and small 
companion animal market.  Virbacs pour-on products, and its subsequent introduction of other products, marked 
Virbacs entry into the large animal market.  The products are applied externally on cattlehence the name pour-on.

 By including this sale in its books and records, Bell was able to achieve Virbacs operating income 
target for 2002, but not its revenue target.  
 
                                                     IV. 
                                              VIOLATIONS 
 
              Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that: 
 
              A.         Walco caused Virbacs violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of  the Securities 
Act, and Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-
1, and 13a-13 thereunder, and also caused Bell, Ro           ugraff, and Huberts violations of Section 
13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder; and 
 
        B.        Robison caused Virbacs violations of         Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the 
Securities Act, and Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 
12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder, and also caused Bell, Rougraff, and Huberts violations of 
Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder. 
 
                                                      V. 
                                                        
             In view of the foregoing,   the Commission deems it appropria te to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in the Respondents Offer.    6
 
              Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act and 
Section 21C of the Exchange Act, that: 
 
              A.         Respondent Walco cease and desist from committing or causi    ng any violation and 
any future violation of Sections  17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of  the Securities Act,  and Sections 13(a), 
13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, and 
13b2-1 thereunder; and 
 
        B.      Respondent Robison cease and desist from committing or causing any violation and 
any future violation of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act and Section 13(b)(5) of

violation of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 
13a-1 and13a-13 thereunder.
