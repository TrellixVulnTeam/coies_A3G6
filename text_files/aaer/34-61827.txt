                                                                   : 
_______________________________________      
                                                      
 
                                                I.  
 
       The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the 
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against J. 
Michael Broullire (“Respondent” or “Broullire”) pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(i) of the 
Commission’s Rules of Practice. 1 
                                    
                                                  

                                                 
1
 Rule 102(e)(3)(i) provides, in relevant part, that: 
 
       The Commission, with due regard to the public interest and without preliminary hearing, 
may, by order, . . . suspend from appearing or practicing before it any . . . accountant . . . who has 
been by name . . . permanently enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction, by reason of his 
or her misconduct in an action brought by the Commission, from violating or aiding and abetting 
the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or of the rules and regulations 
thereunder.

                                              II.  
 
       In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the 
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings 
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these 
proceedings, and the findings contained in Section III  below, which are admitted, Respondent 
consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Rule 102(e) 
of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions 
(“Order”), as set forth below.   
 
                                              III.  
 
       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that:  
 
              1.      Broullire, age 56, is and has been a certified public accountant licensed to 
practice in the State of Maryland.  During the relevant period, 2003-2006, Broullire practiced 
accounting with a small accounting firm in Maryland and then with his own accounting business. 
        
              2.      TVI Corporation is a Maryland corporation headquartered in Glenn Dale, 
Maryland.  TVI’s business includes selling emergency response equipment to the government and 
other purchasers.  During the relevant period, TVI’s common stock was registered with the 
Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”).  
After July 2006, TVI’s stock was registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) and 
traded on the NASDAQ SmallCap Market under the symbol “TVIN,” and then was registered 
pursuant to Section 12(g) and quoted on the Pink Sheets under the symbol “TVINQ.PK.”  In 
September 2009, TVI’s stock registration was revoked. 
        
              3.      On March 25, 2010, the Commission filed a complaint against Broullire in 
SEC v. Richard V. Priddy, et al. (Civil Action No. 1:10-cv-00739  (BEL)(D. Md.).  On March 26, 
2010, the court entered an order permanently enjoining Broullire, by consent, from aiding and 
abetting future violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-
20, and 13a-1 thereunder.    
 
       4.     The Commission’s complaint alleged, among other things, that Broullire 
 participated in fraudulent schemes with TVI’s former President and CEO and former Executive 
 Vice President by which they created two companies to purchase products and resell them to 
 TVI at approximately a 100% or  greater markup.  The Complaint also alleged that TVI paid one 
 of these companies a fictitious finder’s fee in connection with a corporate acquisition.  The 
 Complaint alleged that these fraudulent schemes enriched Broullire and the former TVI 
 executives and materially reduced the net income that TVI reported in its 2004 Form 10-KSB 
 and 2006 Form 10-K.

             In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
impose the sanction agreed to in Respondent Broullire’s Offer. 
 
             Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that Broullire is suspended 
from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant.   
 
 By the Commission.
