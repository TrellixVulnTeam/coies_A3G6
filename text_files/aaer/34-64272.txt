                                              II.  
 
       In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the 
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings 
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these

                                              III.  
 
       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that:  
 
       1.     Mody,  age 48, of Agoura Hills, California, has been a certified public accountant 
licensed to practice in the State of California since 1990; the status of his license is currently 
inactive.  Mody began work at Vitesse Semiconductor Corporation (“Vitesse” or the “Company”) 
in 1992 and served as Controller from 1993 through November 1998, at which time he was 
promoted to Vice President and Controller.  Mody’s job title changed slightly in 2002 to Vice 
President, Finance and Controller.  In April 2005, he was promoted to Chief Financial Officer and 
thereafter served as Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer.  On May 17, 2006, 
Vitesse’s Board of Directors terminated Mody due to concerns regarding the integrity of 
documents evidencing the Company’s stock option grant practices. 
        
       2.     Vitesse based in Camarillo, California , is a major producer of high-performance   
integrated circuits for use primarily by systems manufacturers in the storage and communications 
industries.   Vitesse was incorporated in Delaware in 1987, is headquartered in Camarillo, 
California, and maintains a September 30   th
                                             fiscal year-end.  Duri  ng the relevant period, the   
Company’s common stock was registered with the Commissi on pursuant to Section 12(b) of the  
Securities Exchange Act of 1934  (“Exchange Act”) and traded  on the Nasdaq National Market 
under the symbol VTSS.  The Co  mpany’s common stock is currently traded on the Nasdaq    
National Market under the symbol “VTSS.”     
 
       3.     On March 22, 2011, a final judgment was entered against Mody, permanently 
enjoining him from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; Sections 10(b) 
and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder, and 
aiding and abetting violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) and 
Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder, in the civil action entitled Securities and Exchange 
Commission v. Yatin D. Mody, et al., Civil Action Number 10-CV-9239, in the United States 
District Court for the Southern District of New York. Mody was also ordered to pay $105,604 in  
disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and $56,716 in prejudgment interest, for a total of $162,320.

        4.      The Commission’s complaint alleged, among other things, that Vitesse engaged in 
fraudulent revenue recognition practices that resulted in the Company filing with the Commission 
materially false and misleading financial statements in annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly  
reports on Forms 10-Q from at least late 2001 th  rough early 2006.  The complaint alleges that   
Mody participated in prematurely and improper ly recording revenues on product shipments to 
Vitesse’s distributors and customers and failed to timely and properly record customer credits from 
the return of unwanted product.  The complain        t alleges that Mody engaged in the foregoing    
misconduct from late 2001 through  2005.  As a result, the compla int alleges that Mody, among 
other violations: engaged in fraudulent accoun        ting practices that materially misstated the 
company’s annual and quarterly financial statemen  ts, which he reviewed and participated in    
preparing; knowingly circumvented or failed to implement Vitesse’s system of internal accounting 
controls and falsified Vitesse’s books, records, or accounts; and made material misrepresentations  
to Vitesse’s independent auditor.  The complaint  further alleges that, as part of his misconduct,   
Mody signed and certified annual and quarterly repor ts containing false and misleading financial  
statements, including Vitesse’s 2005 Form 10- K filed on December 13, 2005 and three Vitesse   
Forms 10-Q filed between May 2005 and February 2006, and that Mody signed in 2005 and 2006  
certain Vitesse registration statements filed on Form S-8 and Form S-3 that incorporated by 
reference materially false and misleading Forms 10-K and/or Forms 10-Q. 
 
                                                  IV. 
                                                     
        In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
impose the sanction agreed to in Respondent Mody’s Offer. 
 
        Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that:  
 
        Mody is suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant.   
 
 
 By the Commission.
