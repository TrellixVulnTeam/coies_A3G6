              1.     Furman, age 42, resides in San Diego, California.  From September 2003 
through January 2005, Furman   was the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of Island Pacific, Inc.  
(Island Pacific), whose common stock was registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 
12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and traded on the American Stock 
Exchange until it was delisted on October 25, 2005, as a result of the companys  failure to file 
periodic reports.  As Island Pacifics CFO, Furman oversaw Island Pacifics financial operations, 
participated in the preparation of Island Pacifics financial statements, and certified the accuracy of 
Island Pacifics quarterly and annual reports, which were filed with the Commission.  Furman was 
licensed as a certified public a ccountant (CPA) in 1991 by the State of Washington  and was 
employed as an auditor by a public accounting firm for two years .  Both prior to and  subsequent to 
his employment with Island Pacific, Furman was the CFO of other public companies.  Presently, he 
performs consulting work through his own company, Black Rock Management, providing interim 
finance and CFO -type  services to smaller companies, including a public co mpany where he 
previously was the CFO. 
                 
       B.     CIVIL INJUNCTION 
        
                     1. On July 8, 2011, the United States District Court for the Southern District of 
California entered a final judgment against Furman, permanently enjoining him from future 
violations, direct or indirect, of Sections 10(b) an d 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 
13a-14, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violations of Section 13(a) of 
the Exchange Act  and Rules 12b -20, 13a  -1, and 13a -13 thereunder, in the civil action entitled 
Securities and Exchange Commission v. Retail Pro, Inc. (fka Island Pacific, Inc.), et al., Civil 
Action Number 08 CV 1620 WQH (RBB).  The final judgment also prohibits Furman for a period 
of seven years from serving as an officer or director of a public company and orders him to pay a 
third-tier civil penalty of $75,000. 
 
              2.      On  November 18, 2009, the Court entered an Order granting partial 
summary judgment in the Commissions favor, holding that Furman had violated Section 13(b)(5) 
of the Exchange Act and Rules 13b2  -1 and 13b2-2 thereunder.  On February 25, 2011, following 
trial, a jury returned a verdict in the Commissions favor on its remaining claims for relief, finding 
that Furman had violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule       s 10b -5 and 13a -14 
thereunder, and had aided and abetted one or more violations by Island Pacific of Section 13(a) of 
the Exchange Act and Rules 12b -20, 13a-1, and 13a -13 thereunder.  Subsequently, on June 23, 
2011, the Court entered Orders in support of t he above final judgment and making findings of fact 
and conclusions of law concerning the relief sought by the Commission and then awarded by the 
Court.  The   Court found that the evidence presented at trial and on summary judgment 
demonstrated that Furman played an essential and knowing role in the securities law violations at 
issue.  The Court found, among other things, that: 
               
              •  Furman knowingly participated in and facilitated the alteration of a 
                  license agreement ,  which permitted Island Pacific to imprope  rly 
                  record revenue of $3.9 million in its fiscal second quarter 2004 , and 
                  then directed Island Pacific to record a second transaction in its fiscal 

                                               2  
---------------------Page 3---------------------

 
                  third quarter 2004 that offset the $3.9 million receivable issued in the 
                  prior quarter, based on a sublicense agreement Furman knew was not 
                  finalized, and that Furman further knew it was improper to record 
                  under both Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) 
                  and Island Pacifics own revenue recognition policy; 
              •  Furman drafted or was responsible for the means by which Island 
                  Pacifics fiscal  2004 second and third quarter and annual financial 
                  information was disseminated to the investing public and knew that 
                  this information materially misrepresented Island Pacifics financial 
                  results and also contained material omissions; 
              •  Furman knowingly and willingly participated in the termination of a 
                  whistleblower employee  and subsequent efforts to conceal the 
                  whistleblowers concerns and allegations of potential fraud from the 
                  companys auditors; 
              •  Furman knowingly withheld          and concealed other material 
                  information from the auditors, including the various versions of the 
                  license  and sublicense  agreements   and documents showing that 
                  neither transaction was finalized by the end of the quarter in which 
                  the transaction was reported; 
              •  Furman signed management representation letters knowing they 
                  contained false and/or misleading statements , including that he had 
                  no knowledge of any allegations of fraud or suspected fraud affecting 
                  the company received in communications from employees or former 
                  employees, even though he had received an email           from the 
                  whistleblower explaining in detail why certain transactionsappear 
                  to be structured in a manner that is intended to inflate revenues for 
                  the purpose of boosting the share price, and had responded by firing 
                  the whistleblower the next day -- just a few days before signing one 
                  management representation letter;  
              •  Furman knowingly circumvented the companys system of 
                  accounting controls by signing false  ma   nagement representation 
                  letters; 
              •  At each step in the process, Furman had the opportunity to refuse to 
                  continue to participate in the infractions and/or concealment of the 
                  infractions; and 
              •  The nature of Furmans work a s a consultant performing officer-
                  like activities presents an ongoing opportunity for him to violate the 
                  securities laws. 
                                                
                                              III. 
        
       Based upon the foregoing, the Commission finds that a court of competent jurisdiction has 
permanently enjoined Furman   , a CPA,   from violating the Federal securities laws within the 
meaning of Rule 102(e)(3)(i)(A) of the Commissions Rules of Practice.  In view of these findings, 
                                               3

suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission. 
   
       IT IS HEREBY ORDERED t hat Furman be, and hereby is, temporarily suspended from

hearing is ordered, following the hearing, the Commission may lift the suspension, censure the  
petitioner, or disqualify the petitioner from appearing or practicing before the Commission for a 
period of time, or permanently, pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(iii).
