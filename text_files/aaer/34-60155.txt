                                                I.  
 
       The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the 
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against      
Anthony R. Russo, CPA (“Respondent” or “Russo”) pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(i) of the               
Commission’s Rules of Practice. 1 
                                    
                                               II.  
 
       In anticipation of the institution of these  proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the “Offer”) whic h the Commission has determined   to accept.  Solely for the 
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the              
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings  
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisd  iction over him and the subject matter of these      
                                                 
1 
 Rule 102(e)(3)(i) provides, in relevant part, that: 
 
       The Commission, with due regard to the public  interest and without preliminary hearing, 
       may, by order, . . . suspend from appearing or practicing before it any . . . accountant . . . 
       who has been by name . . . permanently enjoin ed by any court of competent jurisdiction, 
       by reason of his or her misconduct in an action brought by the Commission, from     
       violating or aiding and abetting the violati on of any provision of the Federal securities 
       laws or of the rules and regulations thereunder.

proceedings, and the findings contained in S ection III.2 below, which are admitted, Respondent  
consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Rule 102(e) 
of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Maki        ng Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions          
(“Order”), as set forth below.   
 
                                                  III.  
 
        On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that:  
 
        1.      Russo, age 66, was a certified public accountant licensed to practice in the State of 
New York until his license became inactiv          e during 2006.  From       August 2002 through 
approximately December 2003, Russo was Certified Services, Inc.’s (“Certified”) Chief Executive          
Officer and Chief Financial Officer. 
         
        2.      On March 6, 2008, the Commission filed a complaint against Russo and others in 
the United States District Court, Southern District of Florida.  [SEC  v. Anthony R. Russo, et al.,  
Civil Action No. 08-60315-Zloch] .  On May 15, 2009, the court entered an order permanently 
enjoining Russo, by consent, from future violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder,  
and aiding and abetting violations of Sections13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange 
Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.  The Court also required Russo to pay 
disgorgement, prejudgment interest thereon and a civil money penalty and barred him from 
participating in an offering of penny stock. 
 
        3.      The Commission’s complaint alle          ged, among other things, that from 
 approximately August 2002 through at least December 2003, Respondent and others violated the  
 anti-fraud and the books and records provisions of the federal securities laws.  These violations 
 allowed Certified and others to overstate Certified’s financial condition in filings made with the 
 Commission.   In addition, Certified and others failed to disclose related party transactions.          
 Moreover, the Commission’s complaint alleged that  this scheme allowed tens of millions of 
 dollars of Certified’s funds to be siphoned into shells, which were controlled by related parties.   
      
                                                  IV. 
                                                     
        In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
impose the sanction agreed to in Respondent Russo’s Offer. 
 
        Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that:  
 
        Respondent Russo is suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an  
accountant.   
 
 By the Commission.
