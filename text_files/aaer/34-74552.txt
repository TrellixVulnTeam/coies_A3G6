      These administrative proceedings were instituted pursuant to Rule of Practice 
102(e)(1)(iii).1
               The law judge's initial decision denied the privilege of appearing or practicing 
before the Commission to four of the five respondents for a period of six months  and i t censured 
the remaining respondent, Dahua CPA, Ltd. (Dahua).2
                                                   The Division of Enforcement 
("Division") sought review of, among other things, "that portion of the Initial Decision" 
regarding the remedies imposed on Dahua.  Dahua did not file a petition for review.   We granted 
the Division's petition for review and also determined, on our own initiative, to review what 
sanctions, if any, were appropriate .3
                                 

      The Division has filed an unopposed motion to withdraw its petition for review as to 
Dahua, which is accompanied by a Joint Stipulation of Dismissal of Appeal as to Dahua entered 
into by the Division and by a representative partner of Dahua.  The motion seeks "dismissal of 
all issues relating specifically to Dahua that have been raised on appeal from the Initial Decision 
by the Division and/or the Commission ('Dahua -Related Appeal Issues')."  The Division states

that it does not seek dismissal of any other aspect of the Division's petition for review, including, 
in particular, issues relating to remedies imposed on the other respondents.   

       The Division argues that the Dahua  -Related Appeal Issues should be dismissed because 
subsequent events, including the Commission's February 6, 2015 settlement with the other four 
respondents,4
              have substantially mitigated the  concerns underlying its petition for review as it 
relates to Dahua.  It further states that, because of the Commission's recent settlement with the 
other respondents, it is not currently the case that the initial decision's absence of a practice bar 
against Dahua would risk u ndermining the remedies imposed on the other respondents.  The 
Division also asserts that Dahua, at present, is performing little or no audit work for U.S. issuers, 
thereby minimizing the risk of future harm to the Commission's processes.  Finally, the Div ision 
believes that, if future cooperation regarding Dahua's audit work papers becomes necessary, it 
can seek such cooperation from Dahua and the China Securities Regulatory Commission 
following the procedures set forth in the settlement order.  For all of these reasons, the Division 
contends that the changed circumstances weigh against imposition of an  y additional remedy 
against Dahua at the current time. 

       The relief sought by the Division appears to be appropriate .   
        
       Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the Division's unopposed motion is GRA       NTED.  The 
Commission has determined to dismiss the Division's petition for review as it relates to Dahua  
and dismiss its own review of remedies as it relates to Dahua.  It is further ORDERED that 
notice is hereby given that the initial decision of the administrative law judge is reinstated and 
has become the final decision of the Commission as to Dahua   .  The order contained in that 
decision is hereby declared effective as to Dahua.  The initial decision censured Dahua pursuant 
to Rule 102(e)(1)(iii) of the Commission's Rules of Practice.  
        
       It is further ORDERED that the remainder of the Division's petition for review and the 
Commission's review of sanctions remain stayed in accordance with the Commission's February 
6 settlement order. 
        
       By the Commission.
