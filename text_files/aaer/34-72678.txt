                                         II.

                                              III. 
                                                 
       On the basis of this Order and Respondents Offer, the Commission finds that1
                                                                                    :  
 
                                           Summary 
 
       1.     This matter concerns violations of the anti-bribery, books and records and internal 
controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by Smith & Wesson.  The 
violations took place from 2007 through early 2010, when a senior employee and other employees 
and representatives of Smith & Wesson made, authorized, and offered to make improper payments 
and/or to provide gifts to foreign officials in an attempt to win contracts to sell firearm products to 
foreign military and law enforcement departments.  During this period, Smith & Wessons 
international business was in its developing stages and accounted for approximately 10% of the 
companys revenues.  Smith & Wessons employees and representatives engaged in a systemic 
pattern of making, authorizing and offering bribes while seeking to expand the companys overseas 
business.   
        
       2.     The bribe payments were inaccurately recorded in Smith & Wessons books and 
records as legitimate sales commissions or other business expenses.  Despite its push to make sales 
in new and high risk markets overseas, Smith & Wesson  failed to establish an appropriate 
compliance program or devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls, 
which allowed the repeated improper offers and payments to continue undetected for years.   
        
                                            Respondent 
 
       3.     Smith & Wesson is a Nevada corporation with its principal place of business in 
Springfield, Massachusetts.  The company , through its wholly owned subsidiary, Smith & Wesson 
Corp., manufactures firearms and markets its products both domestically in the United States and 
internationally in multiple countries.  Smith & Wesson does not have any international subsidiaries 
and conducts its international business directly and through brokering agents.  Much of Smith & 
Wessons international business involves the sale of firearms to foreign law enforcement and 
military departments.  Smith & Wesson  issues and maintains a class of publicly-traded securities 
registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, which trades on the NASDAQ Stock 
Exchange.   
        
                                               Facts 
        
       4.     From 2007 through early 2010, a  s Smith & Wesson sought to break into 
international markets and increase sales, certain of the companys employees and representatives 
engaged in a pervasive practice of making, authorizing and offering improper payments to foreign 
government officials as a means of obtaining or retaining international business.  Although only 
                                                 
1
 The findings herein are made pursuant to the Respondents Offer and are not binding on any other person or entity 
in this or any other proceeding.  

                                               2  
---------------------Page 3---------------------

one of the contracts was fulfilled before the unlawful activity was  identified, company employees 
made or authorized the making of improper payments in connection with multiple ongoing or 
contemplated international sales. 
 
       5.     In 2008, for example, Smith & Wesson retained a third-party agent in Pakistan to 
assist the company in obtaining a deal to sell firearms to a Pakistani police department.  Even after 
the agent notified the company that he would be providing guns valued in excess of $11,000 to 
Pakistani police officials in order to obtain the deal, and that he would be making additional cash 
payments to the officials, the company authorized the agent to proceed with the deal.  Smith & 
Wessons Vice President of International Sales and its Regional Director of International Sales 
authorized the sale of the guns to the agent to be used as improper gifts and authorized payment of 
the commissions to the agent, while knowing or consciously disregarding the fact that the agent 
would be providing the guns and part of his commissions to Pakistani officials as an inducement 
for them to award the tender to the company.  Smith & Wesson  ultimately sold 548 pistols to the 
Pakistani police for $210,980 and profited from the corrupt deal in the amount of $107,852. 
        
       6.     In 2009, Smith & Wesson attempted to win a contract to sell firearms to an 
Indonesian police department by making improper payments to its third party agent in Indonesia, 
who indicated that part of the payment would be provided to the Indonesian police officials under 
the guise of legitimate firearm lab testing costs.  On several occasions, Smith & Wessons third-
party agent indicated that the Indonesian police expected Smith & Wesson to pay them additional 
amounts above the actual cost of testing the guns as an inducement to enter the contract.  The agent 
later notified Smith & Wessons Regional Director of International Sales that the price of testing 
the guns had risen further.  Smith & Wessons Vice President of International Sales and its 
Regional Director of International Sales authorized and made the inflated payment, but a deal was 
never consummated. 
        
       7.     Similarly, Smith & Wesson made improper payments in 2009 to     its third party 
agent in Turkey, who indicated that part of the payments would be provided to Turkish officials in 
an attempt to secure two deals in Turkey, for the sale of handcuffs to Turkish police and firearms 
to the Turkish military.  Neither of these interactions resulted in the shipment of products, as Smith 
& Wesson was unsuccessful bidding for the first deal, while the latter deal was ultimately 
canceled.  Similarly, Smith & Wesson authorized improper payments to third party agents who 
indicated that parts of these payments would be provided to foreign officials in Nepal and 
Bangladesh in unsuccessful attempts to secure sales contracts in those countries.  Although these 
contemplated deals in Nepal and Bangladesh were never consummated in each case, the company 
had obtained or attempted to obtain the contract by using third party agents as a conduit for 
improper payments to government officials.   
        
       8.     Despite making it a high priority to grow sales in new and high risk markets 
overseas, the company failed to design and implement a system of internal controls or an 
appropriate FCPA compliance program reasonably designed to address the increased risks of its 
new business model.  The company   did not perform any anti-corruption risk assessment and 
conducted virtually no due diligence of its third-party agents regardless of the perceived level of 
corruption in the country in which Smith & Wesson was seeking to do business.  Smith & Wesson 

                                               3  
---------------------Page 4---------------------

failed to devise adequate policies and procedures for commission payments, the use of samples for 
test and evaluation, gifts, and commission advances.  The Vice President of International Sales had 
almost complete authority to conduct the companys international business, including the sole 
ability to approve most commissions.  Smith & Wessons FCPA policies and procedures, and its 
FCPA-related training and supervision also were inadequate.  As a result of these compliance and 
internal controls failures, Smith & Wessons Vice President of International Sales and the Regional 
Director of International Sales were able to cause the company to pay and/or authorize improper 
payments in numerous countries around the globe for a period of several years.   
 
                            Smith & Wessons Remedial Measures 
        
       9.     Smith & Wesson took prompt action to remediate its immediate FCPA     issues, 
including:  conducting an internal investigation, terminating its entire international sales staff; 
terminating pending international sales transactions; and re-evaluating the markets in which it 
sought international sales.  In addition, Smith & Wesson implemented a series of significant 
measures to improve its internal controls and compliance processes, including: implementing new 
internal audit procedures to identify FCPA issues; creating more robust controls on payments, 
gifts, and other transactions in connection with international business activity; enhancing its FCPA 
compliance policies and procedures; and creating a Business Ethics and Compliance Committe  e. 
 
                               Legal Standards and Violations 
                                                 
       10.    Under Section 21C(a) of the Exchange Act, the Commission may impose a cease-
and-desist order upon any person who is violating, has violated, or is about to violate any provision 
of the Exchange Act or any regulation thereunder, and upon any other person that is, was, or would 
be a cause of the violation, due to an act or omission the person knew or should have known would 
contribute to such violation. 
        
                                       FCPA Violations 
                                                 
                                    Anti-Bribery Violations 
                                                 
       11.    Smith & Wesson violated the anti -bribery provisions of the federal securities laws 
when it authorized its agents to provide gift guns and make other improper payments to foreign 
officials in Pakistan,  Indonesia, Turkey, Nepal and Bangladesh in order to induce foreign 
officials in those countries to award sales contracts to Smith & Wesson.   
        
       12.    As a result of the conduct described above, Smith & Wesson    violated Section 30A 
of the Exchange Act, which prohibits any issuer with a class of securities registered pursuant to 
Section 12 of the Exchange Act, in order to obtain or retain business, from giving, or authorizing 
the giving of, anything of value to any foreign official for purposes of influencing the official or 
inducing the official to act in violation of his or her lawful duties, or to secure any improper 
advantage; or to induce a foreign official to use his influence with a foreign government or 
foreign governmental instrumentality to influence any act or decision of such government or 
instrumentality.  15 U.S.C. § 78dd- 1. 

                                               4  
---------------------Page 5---------------------

                                 Books and Records Violations 
        
       13.    Smith & Wesson failed to properly account for the improper payments to its agent 
in Pakistan, the inflated lab testing payments to its agent in Indonesia, and the improper expense 
payments to its agents in Turkey in its books and records.  Instead, Smith & Wesson improperly 
characterized the payments it made in Pakistan as legitimate commissions, and those that it made 
in Indonesia and Turkey as legitimate business expenses.  
        
       14.    As a result of the conduct described above, Smith & Wesson   violated Section 
13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act, which requires reporting companies to make and keep books, 
records, and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect their transactions 
and disposition of their assets.  15 U.S.C. § 78m(b)(2)(A). 
        
                                  Internal Controls Violations 
                                                 
       15.    Smith & Wesson failed to devise and maintain  sufficient internal controls with 
respect to its international sales operations.  While the company had a basic corporate policy 
prohibiting the payment of bribes, it failed to implement a reasonable system of controls to effectuate 
that policy.  For example, Smith & Wesson failed to devise adequate policies and procedures with 
regard to commission payments, the use of samples for test and evaluation, gifts, and commission 
advances.  Further, Smith & Wessons FCPA policies and procedures, and its FCPA-related 
training and supervision were inadequate.  
        
       16.    As a result of the conduct described above, Smith & Wesson   violated Section 
13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, which requires reporting companies to, among other things,  
devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable 
assurances that transactions are executed in accordance with managements general or specific 
authorization; transactions are recorded as necessary to maintain accountability for assets, and 
that access to assets is permitted only in accordance with managements general or specific 
authorization.  15 U.S.C. § 78m(b)(2)(B). 
 
             Commission Consideration of Smith & Wessons        Remedial Efforts  
                                                 
       In determining to accept the Offer, the Commission considered the  remedial acts 
promptly undertaken by Respondent and the cooperation afforded the Commission staff                                   . 
 
                                              IV. 
                                                 
                                      UNDERTAKINGS 
                                                 
       Respondent undertakes to: 
 
       17.    Report to the Commission staff on the status of Respondents remediation and 
implementation of compliance measures at six-month to twelve-month intervals during a two-year 
term, as set forth below.  Should Respondent discover credible evidence, not already reported to 
the Commission staff, that questionable or corrupt payments or questionable or corrupt transfers of 
                                               5  
---------------------Page 6---------------------

property or interests may have been offered, promised, paid, or authorized by an entity or person 
working directly for Respondent, or that related false books and records have been maintained, 
Respondent shall promptly report such conduct to the Commission staff.  During this two-year 
period, Respondent shall: (i) conduct an initial review and submit an initial report, and (ii) conduct 
and prepare follow-up reviews and reports, as described below: 
        
              a.      Respondent shall submit to the Commission staff a written report within 
180 calendar days of the signing of this agreement setting forth a complete description of its 
remediation efforts to date, its proposals reasonably designed to improve the policies and 
procedures of Respondent for ensuring compliance with the FCPA and other applicable anti-
corruption laws, and the parameters of the subsequent reviews.  The report shall be transmitted to 
Paul G. Block  , Assistant Regional Director, Enforcement Division, Boston Regional Office, U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission, 33 Arch Street, Suite 2300, Boston  , Massachusetts 02110.  
The Commission staff may, upon written request of Respondent and for good cause shown, 
approve an extension of the time period for issuance of the report. 
               
              b.      Respondent shall undertake two follow-up reviews, incorporating any 
comments provided by the Commission staff on Respondents initial review and report, to further 
monitor and assess whether the policies and procedures of Respondent are reasonably designed to 
detect and prevent violations of the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws. 
               
              c.      The first follow-up review and report shall be completed by 180 days after 
the initial review.  A subsequent follow-up review and report shall be completed by 360 days after 
the completion of the preceding follow-up review. 
               
              d.      The Commission staff may, upon written request of Respondent and for 
good cause shown, approve an extension of the time period for issuance of the report. 
               
       18.    The Commission staff may make reasonable requests for further evidence of 
compliance, and Respondent agrees to provide such evidence.   
        
       19.    The periodic review and reports submitted by Respondent will likely include 
proprietary, financial, confidential, and competitive business information.  Public disclosure of 
the reports could discourage cooperation, impede pending or potential government investigations 
or undermine the objectives of the reporting requirement.  For these reasons, among others, the 
reports and contents thereof are intended to remain and shall remain non-public, except            
(1) pursuant to court order, (2) as agreed by the parties in writing, (3) to the extent that the 
Commission staff determines in its sole discretion that disclosure would be in furtherance of the 
Commissions discharge of its duties and responsibilities, or (4) is otherwise required by law. 
        
                                               V. 
                                                 
       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in Respondent Smith & Wessons Offer.
