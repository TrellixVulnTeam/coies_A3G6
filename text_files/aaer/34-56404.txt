                                              III. 

       On the basis of this Order and Respondents’ Offer, the Commission finds3
                                                                                that: 

A.     RESPONDENTS 

       1.       Bujan & Associates, Ltd (the “Firm”) is an Illinois corporation and a public 
accounting firm headquartered in Homer Glen, Illinois.  The Firm audited eNucleus, Inc.’s 
(“eNucleus”) financial statements for the company’s 2003 fiscal year ended December 31, 2003.  
eNucleus dismissed the Firm as its independent auditor on December 15, 2004. 

       2.       Frank Bujan, CPA, (“Bujan”) of Homer Glen, Illinois is a certified public 
accountant licensed in the state of Illinois since 1992.  Bujan was the engagement partner in 
connection with the Firm’s audit of eNucleus’s financial statements for the company’s 2003 fiscal 
year ended December 31, 2003. 

B.     FACTS 

       1.     eNucleus is a Delaware corporation with its headquarters in Rolling Meadows, 
Illinois. eNucleus’s common stock is registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of 
the Exchange Act and trades on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol ENUI.  For its fiscal 
year ended December 31, 2003, eNucleus reported revenues of $578,000 and total assets of $1.8 
million. 

       2.     eNucleus has at all relevant times been an issuer as defined by the Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act of 2002 (the “Act”). 

       3.     The Firm audited eNucleus’s 2003 financial statements included in eNucleus’s 
annual report for fiscal year 2003 on Form 10-KSB, filed with the Commission on April 14, 2004.  
As part of that audit, the Firm prepared and issued an audit report dated April 12, 2004 (the 
“eNucleus audit report”), which the company included in its 2003 Form 10-KSB.  eNucleus paid

       The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondents’ Offer of Settlement and are not binding on any 
other person or entity in this or any other proceeding. 

                                               2

the Firm $8,500 for the audit work.  4 

        4.      At the time the Firm issued the eNucleus audit report, it was not registered with the 
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the “Board”), as required by Section 102(a) of the 
Act. 

        5.      Bujan was the engagement partner on the Firm’s audit of eNucleus’s 2003 financial 
statements.  Bujan participated in the preparation and issuance of the eNucleus audit report. 

        6.      By order dated July 28, 2005, the Board disapproved an application for registration 
submitted by the Firm based in part on the Firm’s violation of Section 102(a) of the Act in issuing 
the eNucleus audit report. 5
                              The order effectively prevented the Firm from becoming registered 
with the Board until after April 1, 2006, approximately one year from the date the Board issued a 
notice of hearing on the Firm’s application.  6
                                                 Bujan has only worked as an accountant through the 
Firm since before the Board’s order and has not otherwise been associated with a public 
accounting firm registered with the Board. 

C.      VIOLATIONS 

        1.      Section 102(a) of the Act provides that “it shall be unlawful for any person that is 
not a registered public accounting firm to prepare or issue, or to participate in the preparation or 
issuance of, any audit report with respect to any issuer.” 7 

        2.      The provisions of Section 102(a) of the Act became effective on October 22, 2003.       8 

4 
        During the course of the Commission’s investigation, the Firm voluntarily reimbursed eNucleus the $8,500 
in audit fees.  In view of the Firm’s reimbursement, the Commission is not ordering disgorgement in this matter. 
5 
        PCAOB Release No. 2005-016 (July 28, 2005).  The order also found that the Firm’s issuance of the eNucleus 
audit report violated Board Rule 2100, which implemented Section 102(a) of the Act.  Id. 
6 
        The order states that with respect to any new registration application the Firm submits after April 1, 2006, 
the Board will not issue a notice of hearing to determine whether to approve or disapprove such application based 
solely on the violations subject to the Board’s order.  Id. 
7 
        A violation of the Act or any rule that the Board issues under the Act is treated for all purposes in the same 
manner as a violation of the Exchange Act, including with respect to penalties.  Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 15 
U.S.C.A. § 7202(b)(1) (West 2002). 
8 
        Section 102(a) became effective “[b]eginning 180 days after the date of the determination of the 
Commission under Section 101(d)” of the Act that the Board was prepared to undertake its statutory responsibilities.  
The Commission made the required determination on April 25, 2003.  See Order Regarding Section 101(d) of the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Securities Act Release No. 8223, Exchange Act Release No. 47746, 2003 WL 
1956164  (Apr. 25, 2003).

       3.      Based on the conduct described above, the Firm willfully 9
                                                                          violated Section 102(a) 
of the Act. 

       4.      Based on the conduct described above, Bujan caused the Firm’s violation of 
Section 102(a) of the Act. 

D. FINDI      NGS 

       Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that the Firm willfully violated Section 
102(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and that Bujan caused the Firm’s violation of Section 
102(a) of the Act. 

E.     UNDERTAKING 

       Respondents have undertaken not to request, demand, or accept, directly or indirectly, any 
compensation from eNucleus in connection with the audit work associated with the eNucleus audit 
report. In determining whether to accept the Offer, the Commission has considered this 
undertaking. 

                                               IV. 

       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in Respondents’ Offer. 

       Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that: 

       1.      Bujan & Associates, Ltd 

               A.     The Firm shall cease and desist from committing or causing any violations 
and any future violations of Section 102(a) of the Act. 

               B.     The Firm is censured. 

               C.     The Firm may practice before the Commission as an independent accountant 
provided that: 

                      1.      It is registered with the Board in accordance with the Act, and such 
registration continues to be effective; and 

                      2.      It has submitted to the Commission staff (attention: Office of the 
Chief Accountant) the Board’s letter notifying the Firm that its registration application has been 
approved. 

9 
       “Willfully” as used in this Order means intentionally committing the act that constitutes the violation. 
There is no requirement that the actor also be aware that he is violating a rule or statute.  See Wonsover v. SEC, 205 
F.3d 408, 414 (D.C. Cir. 2000); Tager v. SEC, 344 F.2d 5, 8 (2d Cir. 1965).

              A.      Bujan shall cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and 
any future violations of Section 102(a) of the Act. 

              B.      Bujan may practice before the Commission as an independent accountant 
provided that: 

                      1.     The public accounting firm with which he is associated is registered 
with the Board in accordance with the Act, and such registration continues to be effective; and 

                      2.     He has submitted to the Commission staff (attention: Office of the 
Chief Accountant) the Board’s letter notifying the public accounting firm with which he is 
associated that its registration application has been approved. 

 By       the Commission.
