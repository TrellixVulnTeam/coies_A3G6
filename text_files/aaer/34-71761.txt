In the Matter of                                  ORDER DENYING PETITION 
                                                  TO LIFT TEMPORARY SUSPENSION 
       THOMAS D. MELVIN, CPA                      AND DIRECTING HEARING          
        
 
 
       On December 20, 2013, we issued an order instituting proceedings against Thomas D. 
Melvin pursuant to Commission Rule of Practice 102(e)(3)1
                                                          that temporarily suspended him 
from appearing or practicing before the Commission  based on his having been enjoined from 
violations of antifraud provisions of the securities laws.2
                                                       Melvin petitions now that we lift that 
suspension. 3
              As discussed below , we deny Melvin's request to lift the temporary suspension and 
set the matter down for a hearing before an administrative law judge . 

                                                           
1
       Rule of Practice 102(e)(3)(i), 17 C.F.R. § 201.102(e)(3)(i), provides, in part, that 
       The Commission, with due regard to the public interest and without preliminary hearing, 
       may, by order, temporarily suspend from appearing or practicing before it any attorney, 
       accountant, engineer, or other professional or expert who has been by name:  
              (A)  Permanently enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction, by reason of 
              his or her misconduct in an action brought by the Commission, from violating or 
              aiding and abetting the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or 
              of the rules and regulations thereunder . . . .

2013).

       Because it contains an explicit request to lift the temporary suspension, we deem the 
document styled "Entry of Appearance and Request for Hearing " a petition to lift the temporary 
suspension pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(ii).

       The Order Instituting Proceedings in this matter  alleges that Melvin is  a certified public 
accountant and a partner in the accounting firm of Melvin, Rooks and Howell in Griffin, 
Georgia.4
           On August 14, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia 
entered a final judgment against Melvin, permanently enjoining him from future violations of 
Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.   5
                                                                                     The 
Commission's complaint, which forms the basis for the district court's injunction, alleges that 
Melvin and others were engaged in a fraudulent insider trading scheme.  According to the 
complaint, Melvin misappropriated confidential information from one of his clients about an 
upcoming merger involving a company of which the client was director.    6
                                                                            With this  information, 
the complaint alleges, Melvin tipped four friends and business associates about the merger in 
violation of his fiduciary duties to his client, and the tippees then purchased shares of the target 
company and realized large profits.7
                                     

       In instituting these disciplinary proceedings, we found it "appropriate and in the public 
interest" that Melvin  be temporarily suspended from appearing or p racticing before the 
Commission based on the district c ourt's final judgment.  We stated that the temporary 
suspension would become permanent unless Melvin filed a petition challenging it within thirty 
days of service of the order, pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(ii).  We further advised that, pursuant to 
Rule 102(e)(3)(iii), upon receipt of such a petition, we would either lift the temporary 
suspension, set the matter down for hearing, or both. 

       In his petition, Melvin requests that the temporary suspension be lifted, arguing that (i ) 
the suspension order was "untimely under the Commission's Rules of Practice," and (ii) the 
Commission, "in conjunction with the negotiation of a settlement in corresponding civil 
enforcement proceedings," entered into a "binding agreement" with Melvin that he "would not be 
suspended in excess of the three years." 

       In its opposition to Melvin's petition, the Division of Enforcement contends that the 
December 20, 2013 suspension order was timely because it was issued within 90 days of the 
expiration of Melvin's time to appeal the district court's judgment.8
                                                                     The Division further

       Rule 102(e)(3), 17 C.F.R. § 201.102(e)(3), provides, "No order of temporary suspension 
shall be entered by the Commission . . . more than 90 days after the date on which the final 
judgment or order entered in a judicial or administrative proceeding became effective, whether 
upon completion of review or appeal or because further review or appeal procedures are no 
longer available."

contends that it made no such agreement with Melvin regarding the length of his    suspension, and 
that such an agreement is inconsistent with the terms of the consent Melvin  executed in 
conjunction with the settlement of the underlying case. 

       Rule 102(e)(3)(i)(a) permits the Commission to suspend any accountant or other 
professional or expert who has been "[p]ermanently enjoined . . . from violating . . . any 
provision of the Federal securities laws or of the rules and regulations thereunder."9
                                                                                       At this 
stage, it appears that the injunction issued against Melvin, based on alleged securities fraud 
violations, "justif[ies] the continuance of his suspension until it can be determined what, if any, 
action may be appropriate to protect the Commissions processes."   10
                                                                       We therefore believe it is 
in the public interest to deny Melvin's request to lift the suspension.11
                                                                        We will set the matter 
down for a hearing  before an administrative law judge, as provided in Rule 102(e)( 3)(iii).12
                                                                                              We 
express no opinion as to the merits of Melvin's claims. 

       Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that the petition of Thomas D. Melvin to lift the 
temporary suspension entered on December 20, 2013, is denied and the suspension will remain 
in effect pending a hearing and decision in this matter; it is further  

       ORDERED that this proceeding be set down for public hearing before an administrative 
law judge in accordance with Rule of Practice 110.  As specified in Rule of Practice 
102(e)(3)(iii), the hearing in this matter shall be expedited in accordance with Rule of Practice 
500; and it is further 

       ORDERED that the administrative law judge shall issue an initial decision no later than 
210 days from the date of service of this order. 

       By the Commission.
