       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds  that: 
        
A.     SUMMARY 
            
       1.      This matter involves improper professional conduct by BDO while serving as the 
auditor for General Employment Enterprises, Inc. (“GEE” or the “Company”), a staffing services 
company whose stock trades on the NYSE MKT.  During BDO’s 2009 audit of GEE’s financial 
statements for its fiscal year ended September 30, 2009, BDO learned that $2.3 million 
(comprising approximately half of GEE’s assets and substantially all of its cash) was unaccounted 
for when GEE’s chief financial officer (the “GEE CFO”) advised BDO, in November 2009, that 
(a) GEE’s purported 90-day non-renewable certificate of deposit (“CD”) at a New York bank had 
not been repaid by the bank after the stated maturity date in mid-October, (b) GEE was missing 
documentation supporting the CD, and (c) a bank employee had told GEE’s CFO that the bank had 
no record of a CD.  Thereafter, BDO received multiple conflicting stories from GEE management 

                                                                                                                                                             
               (iv) with respect to persons licensed to practice as accountants, “improper 
               professional conduct” under Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) means:  

                                               * * * 

               (B) either of the following two types of negligent conduct:  

                      (1) A single instance of highly unreasonable conduct that results in a 
                      violation of applicable professional standards in circumstances in which an 
                      accountant knows, or should know, that heightened scrutiny is warranted. 

                      (2) Repeated instances of unreasonable conduct, each resulting in a 
                      violation of applicable professional standards, that indicate a lack of 
                      competence to practice before the Commission. 
3
 The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent’s Offer of Settlement and are not binding 
on any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding. 

                                                  

                                                2 
---------------------Page 3---------------------

and board members concerning both the status of the CD and a series of transfers totaling $2.3 
million made to GEE by three entities unaffiliated with the bank, one of which BDO had been told 
was owned by GEE’s Chairman and majority shareholder.  After BDO raised questions about these 
deposits, GEE’s chief executive officer claimed the deposits were the proceeds of an agreement to 
assign the CD to a purported unrelated party.   

       2.      BDO’s engagement and concurring partners consulted with senior BDO partners, 
including the assigned BDO regional technical director, BDO’s national director of accounting, 
and BDO’s national SEC practice director.  The consultation resulted in BDO issuing a five-page 
letter, dated December 21, 2009, in which BDO advised GEE of its belief that BDO had not been 
provided sufficient audit evidence to formally conclude on the matter and demanded that GEE’s 
audit committee commission a full investigation of the matter by an independent firm.  BDO 
received conflicting information from various sources as to the existence of the CD and never 
received rational explanations as to why the $2.3 million went missing and why an equivalent 
amount was later received under suspect circumstances.  Only days later, however, after GEE’s 
chief executive officer resigned, BDO agreed to withdraw its demand for an independent 
investigation and issued an audit report containing an unqualified opinion on GEE’s financial 
statements.  Those financial statements, included in GEE’s Form 10-K filed on January 8, 2010, 
represented that GEE had a $2.3 million cash equivalent in the form of CD as of September 30, 
2009, and had entered into an assignment agreement to sell the CD for full face value to an 
unrelated party.   

       3.      Approximately two months after GEE filed its 2009 Form 10-K with BDO’s 
unqualified audit opinion, BDO learned of a criminal complaint against the New York bank 
president.  The criminal complaint alleged, in connection with a wide-ranging conspiracy 
involving, among others, GEE’s then-chief executive officer and GEE’s then-majority shareholder 
and chairman of the board, that (i) GEE’s purported $2.3 million CD never existed, (ii) the bank 
president signed a false confirmation to BDO, (iii) GEE’s $2.3 million was used to attempt to 
conceal a loan default connected to the broader conspiracy, and (iv) the entities that transferred the 
$2.3 million back to GEE were related to the bank president’s co-conspirators, including GEE’s 
then-majority shareholder and chairman of the board.  The bank president pled guilty in October 
2010.  Despite this additional new information, which was conveyed to senior partners in BDO’s 
regional and national offices, BDO failed to perform appropriate audit procedures to determine 
whether this new information had any impact on GEE’s 2009 financial statements or BDO’s audit 
report thereon.  In addition, BDO failed to adequately consider this information during its 
subsequent audit when it provided an audit report containing an unqualified opinion on GEE’s 
financial statements included in the Company’s 2010 Form 10-K.  

       4.      Specifically, among other audit failures during the 2009 and 2010 audits of GEE, 
BDO:  (1) failed to adequately plan, design, and perform audit procedures necessary to determine 
the existence of a disputed asset and the existence of related party transactions; (2) failed to obtain 
sufficient competent evidential matter; (3) failed to exercise professional skepticism and due 
professional care; (4) ignored red flags of fraud, potential illegal acts by GEE’s agents, and 
unidentified related party transactions; (5) placed improper reliance on management 
representations from individuals they did not trust; and (6) failed to appropriately consider the 
discovery of new facts.   

                                                  

                                                3 
---------------------Page 4---------------------

       5.     BDO issued audit reports containing unqualified opinions on the financial 
statements in GEE’s 2009 and 2010 Form 10-Ks, which incorrectly stated that GEE had a cash 
equivalent of $2.3 million as of September 30, 2009, and did not disclose that the $2.3 million was 
returned by entities related to GEE’s chairman of the board.  BDO’s reports, which BDO knew 
would be filed with GEE’s Form 10-Ks, inaccurately stated that the audits had been conducted in 
accordance with standards adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
(“PCAOB”) and that GEE’s financial statements presented fairly, in all material respects, the 
company’s position and results at September 30, 2009, in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”). 

B.     RESPONDENT 
        
       6.     BDO, formerly known as BDO Seidman, LLP, is a Delaware limited liability 
partnership and a PCAOB-registered public accounting firm with its headquarters in Chicago, 
Illinois.  BDO served as GEE’s independent auditor from 2004 through 2012. 
               
C.     RELEVANT BDO PROFESSIONALS  
        
       7.     Sean C. Henaghan (“Henaghan”), age 42, is a Certified Public Accountant

Henaghan served as the BDO engagement partner on the 2009 and 2010 audits of GEE and had 
final responsibility for the audits.     

       8.     John E. Rainis (“Rainis”), age 57, is a CPA licensed to practice in Illinois.  Rainis 
served as the BDO concurring reviewer on the 2009 and 2010 audits of GEE.   
               
       9.     Leland E. Graul (“Graul”), age 66, is a CPA licensed to practice in Illinois.  Prior 
to his retirement, Graul served as BDO’s national director of accounting and risk management 
partner when he was consulted during the 2009 and 2010 audits of GEE.   
        
       10.    James J. Gerace (“Gerace”), age 54, is a CPA licensed to practice in Illinois.  
Gerace served as the regional technical director of BDO when he was consulted during the 2009 
and 2010 audits of GEE.   
        
       11.    Wendy M. Hambleton (“Hambleton”), age 53, is a CPA licensed to practice in

D.     ISSUER AND OTHER RELEVANT ENTITIES AND INDIVIDUALS 

       12.    GEE is an Illinois corporation headquartered in Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois that 
provides professional placement services and temporary staffing services in certain industries.  
GEE’s common stock is registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the 
Exchange Act and trades on the NYSE MKT stock exchange.  GEE files periodic reports,

       13.    River Falls Financial Services, LLC (“River Falls Financial”), River Falls 
Investments, LLC f/k/a Oxygen Unlimited II, LLC (“River Falls Investments”), River Falls 
Holdings, LLC (“RFH”), Accredited Investor Resources, LLC f/k/a Oxygen Investment 
Partners, LLC (“AIR”), Oxygen Unlimited, LLC (“Oxygen”), O2HR, LLC (“O2HR”), SDH 
Realty, LLC (“SDH”), WTS Acquisition LLC (“WTS”), H2H Holdings, LLC (“H2H”), and 
PSQ, LLC (“PSQ”) (collectively, the “Affiliated Entities”) are purported holding, investment, 
employment-related, and insurance companies.  During at least 2009 and 2010, Wilbur Anthony 
              4
Huff (“Huff”)  exercised substantial financial and management control over numerous entities, 
including, among others, the Affiliated Entities and their holdings.  Huff installed other business 
partners to perform day-to-day operational functions and/or serve as the listed owners, directors, or 
managers.  As a convicted felon, Huff faced legal and practical barriers to operating business 
entities in his own name, particularly business in regulated industries, including employment-
related, insurance, and banking companies.   
        
       14.    Park Avenue Bank (“PAB” or “the Bank”) was a New York State chartered bank 
until it was closed by the New York State Banking Department on March 12, 2010, and the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation was named Receiver.  The Affiliated Entities primarily 
conducted their banking business through PAB.  Charles J. Antonucci, Sr. (“Antonucci”) served 
as the president and CEO of PAB from June 2004 until October 2009.  In October 2010, Antonucci 
pled guilty to multiple criminal charges, including securities fraud, bank bribery, embezzlement, 
and providing a false confirmation to BDO of GEE’s purported CD at PAB.  Separately, Park 
Avenue Insurance was a private insurance company owned by Antonucci that was not affiliated 
with PAB.   

       15.    Stephen B. Pence (“Pence”) served as the chairman of the board of GEE from July 
1, 2009, through November 17, 2010.  Although Pence purported to be the sole member and owner 
of PSQ, whose sole asset was the GEE shares representing a controlling stake in the Company as 
of July 1, 2009, PSQ was one of the Affiliated Entities over which Huff exercised substantial 
financial and management control.  PSQ’s acquisition of GEE stake was funded by AIR and 
Oxygen.  Pence also represented to BDO that he was the 100% owner of River Falls Financial, 
another of the Affiliated Entities.  Huff directed substantial monthly payments to Pence ($25,000) 

                                                 
4
 Huff pled guilty to federal mail fraud charges for obtaining insurance premium  finance loans 
under false preten s es in the Western District of Kentucky in 2003.  In 2008, the Commission filed 
charges against Huff related to a scheme to misappropriate assets from  and  to record fake letters of 
c redit  at  Certified Services, Inc. (“Certified”).  SEC v. Huff, 08-CV-60315 (S.D. Fla.).  On October 
22, 2010, the Court entered judgment for the Commission against Huff requiring him to pay more 
than $13 million, among other relief.  Separately, after an October 2012 indictment against him, 
Huff pled guilty on December 23, 2014 to an information, which alleged, among other things, that:  
(1) Huff controlled GEE, in whole or in part, by installing other individuals; (2) Huff participated 
with Antonucci in a conspiracy in which they stole $2.3 million from GEE and Huff later returned 
the $2.3 million to GEE from three companies he controlled; and (3) a large portion of the $2.3 
million received by GEE were funds entrusted to Oxygen by its clients for payment of the clients’ 
employment tax and other obligations.  U.S. v. Huff, 12-CR-750 (S.D.N.Y.).

---------------------Page 6---------------------

from several of the Affiliated Entities to ensure his control over, and ability to influence, GEE’s 
operations.  Pence formerly served as the lieutenant governor of Kentucky from 2003 to 2007 and 
the United States Attorney for the Western District of Kentucky from 2001 to 2003.   

       16.    Ronald E. Heineman (“Heineman”) was appointed as the chief executive officer 
(“CEO”) of GEE on July 1, 2009, in connection with PSQ’s acquisition of a controlling stake in 
GEE.  Heineman served as CEO until his resignation on December 23, 2009, in connection with 
the events described herein.  Huff directed substantial monthly payments to Heineman ($15,000) 
from the Affiliated Entities during this time period.    

       17.    Salvatore J. Zizza (“Zizza”) served as the CEO of GEE from December 23, 2009, 
through December 2012.  Prior to his appointment as CEO, Zizza received monthly payments of 
$20,000 from PSQ, which were funded by several of the Affiliated Entities, for purported 
consulting services, and Zizza frequently attended GEE board meetings as an “invited guest.”  In 
2009, businesses owned or operated by Zizza received loans in excess of $1 million that Huff 
directed from certain of the Affiliated Entities.  
        
       18.    Associate-1 was another of Huff’s business partners and was listed or served at 
various times as a manager of River Falls Investments, Oxygen, and O2HR, and as co-manager of 
River Falls Financial with Heineman.  Associate-1 was also involved in PSQ’s acquisition of a 
controlling stake in GEE and attended several GEE board meetings in 2009.  In addition, from July 
2009 until September 2009, Associate-1 was a signatory on GEE’s bank account at PAB despite 
the fact that Associate-1 was not an official employee, officer, or director of the Company.  
Associate-1 also purported to be the owner of WTS (another of the Affiliated Entities), a holding 
company of On-Site Services, Inc. (“On-Site”) and Ameritemps, Inc. (“Ameritemps”), which 
WTS had acquired in January 2009 with funding from other Affiliated Entities.  Almost 
immediately after PSQ’s acquisition of a controlling stake in GEE, Heineman began presenting 
proposals to GEE’s board for GEE to acquire these companies.  For example, at an August 10, 
2009, GEE board meeting, attended by Pence and Zizza, the board authorized Heineman to enter 
into a letter of intent with WTS to acquire On-Site, and Heineman reported that he would present 
another acquisition candidate, Ameritemps, at the September board meeting.   

E.     BACKGROUND 

       19.    GEE’s May 18, 2009, definitive proxy statement disclosed that, in January 2009, 
GEE began discussions with representatives of River Falls Financial, including Heineman and 
Pence, concerning the possibility of a tender offer and direct cash investment in GEE.  As BDO 
learned later in 2009, Huff was also present for one of the relevant meetings.  The proxy statement 
further disclosed that, on February 11, 2009, River Falls Financial and PSQ, a special purpose 
vehicle purportedly formed by Pence, entered into a non-binding letter of intent with GEE for a 
purchase and tender offer agreement to obtain a controlling stake in GEE.   

       20.    According to GEE’s May 18, 2009, definitive proxy statement, on March 30, 2009, 
after negotiations continued following the February 2009 non-binding letter of intent, Pence signed 
on behalf of PSQ a definitive securities purchase and tender offer agreement (the “Purchase 
Agreement”).  The Purchase Agreement provided that, subject to shareholder approval, PSQ would

acquire a controlling stake in GEE by (1) purchasing 7,700,000 newly-issued shares of GEE 
common stock in a private placement transaction at a purchase price of $0.25 per share for a total 
purchase price of $1,925,000; (2) commencing a cash tender offer to purchase from the Company’s 
shareholders up to 2,500,000 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $0.60 per share; (3) 
appointing three directors to a five-member board of directors, including Pence becoming the 
chairman of the board; and (4) designating Heineman GEE’s CEO.  On June 22, 2009, a GEE 
press release announced that shareholders approved the Purchase Agreement and the closing of the 
Purchase Agreement was announced on July 1, 2009.  As a result, PSQ acquired more than 65% 
ownership of the Company, Pence became GEE’s chairman and appointed two other directors, and 
Heineman became GEE’s CEO. 

       21.    As part of the July 2009 closing of PSQ’s purchase agreement with GEE, GEE 
opened a checking account at PAB into which PSQ’s escrowed $1,925,000 would be deposited 
upon the closing.  According to PAB records received by BDO in 2009, in June 2009, Associate-1 
coordinated with GEE’s chief financial officer (the “GEE CFO”) to have the GEE checking 
account opened at PAB and the authorized signatories on the account were the GEE CFO, Pence, 
and Associate-1.  Those PAB records also indicated that the GEE CFO, Pence, and Associate-1 
remained the only authorized signatories on the account until September 2009, at which time 
Associate-1 was removed and Heineman was added.  Following the closing in early July 2009, 
GEE transferred an additional $750,000 from GEE’s accounts at other banks to the GEE PAB 
checking account.  The approximately $2.6 million deposited in the GEE PAB checking account 
constituted substantially all of GEE’s cash and half of its assets.   
        
       22.    According to information received by BDO, GEE’s CFO identified that $2.3 
million had been withdrawn from the GEE PAB operating account on July 23, 2009, without the 
GEE CFO’s knowledge.  The GEE CFO reported to BDO that when he asked about the withdrawn 
funds, GEE’s CEO Heineman claimed that he had authorized GEE to invest $2.3 million into a CD 
at PAB.  The GEE CFO also informed BDO that, although he had repeatedly requested 
documentation concerning the purported CD, such as a written approval or account agreement—
and cited the lack of documentation as a control deficiency—Heineman only provided the GEE 
CFO with a one-page PDF of a typewritten “Certificate of Deposit Receipt” for $2.3 million with a 
single maturity date of October 21, 2009 and interest rate of two percent.    
        
F.     BDO RECEIVED INCONSISTENT EVIDENCE CONCERNING THE 
       PURPORTED CD AND THE EXISTENCE OF RELATED PARTY 
       TRANSCTIONS 
        
       23.    GEE’s fiscal year ended on September 30, 2009.  As part of its audit of GEE, BDO 
addressed confirmations for GEE’s bank accounts, including the purported CD, to a PAB vice 
president and branch manager.  In October, BDO received a confirmation signed by that vice 
president for the operating account and a confirmation signed by the PAB president Antonucci for 
the purported CD.  BDO concurring partner Rainis noted that it was “unusual” for the PAB 
president to sign the confirmation.  
        
       24.    On October 19, 2009, the GEE CFO provided to audit committee members and 
BDO a report of the evaluation of internal control for fiscal year 2009, which noted the purported 
                                                

                                              7 
---------------------Page 8---------------------

PAB CD as an identified control deficiency.  The report noted that“[t]he transaction was not 
executed by the office of the Treasurer, and no written approval or account agreement was 
provided to the accounting department” and that “it did not conform to the company’s investment 
guidelines” because it did not provide sufficient diversification and PAB did not meet GEE’s size 
requirement.  However, the report concluded that the control deficiency did not constitute a 
material weakness.  BDO concurred with this assessment.   
        
       25.    In early November 2009, the GEE CFO noticed that PAB had not remitted the 
proceeds of the purported CD of $2.3 million plus interest into GEE’s operating account upon the 
maturity date, October 21, 2009.  When the GEE CFO contacted PAB, a PAB representative stated 
that the Bank had no record of the purported CD in its system and then refused to investigate the 
matter any further.  On November 18, 2009, the GEE CFO conveyed this information to the BDO 
engagement partner Henaghan.  The GEE CFO also communicated this information to GEE’s 
audit committee chairman (the “AC Chair”). 
        
       26.    Also in November 2009, BDO partners Henaghan, Graul, and Gerace reviewed 
background check reports of Heineman and Associate-1 that identified potential concerns.  As part 
of BDO’s client retention procedures, BDO had procured a background check of Heineman 
because he was the new CEO of GEE and of Associate-1 because he purportedly owned On-Site, a 
subsidiary of WTS that GEE intended to acquire and which BDO agreed to audit.  Those 
background checks revealed that: 
        
     A 2009 lawsuit named GEE’s CEO Heineman as a defendant and alleged that he received a 
       fraudulent distribution of in excess of $2 million in cash from a bankrupt company he 
       formally ran. 

     Associate-1 served as the chief operating officer of a subsidiary of Certified.  The 
       Commission had alleged in a 2008 complaint that Huff was an “undisclosed control 
       person” who, with others, stole $30 million from Certified.  

     Associate-1 and Heineman were co-managers of River Falls Financial, and participated in 
       negotiating PSQ’s acquisition of GEE shares.   

     Heineman and Associate-1 had several substantial personal tax liens. 

       27.    At a November 23, 2009, audit committee meeting, attended by BDO engagement 
partner Henaghan and concurring partner Rainis, the GEE CFO reported his concerns that GEE 
had little documentation supporting the purported CD, including no written authorization from an 
account signatory and no deposit agreement.  According to the audit committee minutes, 
Heineman claimed that he authorized the purported CD at Pence’s direction, and claimed the lack 
of documentation was due to “the rapid pace of the transactions in which he had been involved, 
coupled with reorganization and personnel changes at Park Avenue Bank.”  Heineman next stated 
that he had anticipated that the CD would be maintained on a continuing renewal basis but he had 
asked Pence to liquidate the purported CD and have the funds transferred into the PAB checking 
account by the end of the week.  The minutes also state that Henaghan “said that the audit was 
substantially completed, pending resolution of the missing funds issue, receipt of legal letters from 

                                                 

                                               8

counsel, and the executed management representation letter” and that BDO “would be issuing an 
unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements.”    
        
       28.    On November 24, 2009, Henaghan emailed the AC Chair, stating that the GEE 
CFO had “indicated there was an update on the CD and that the funds would be returned in 
installments.  I am not sure if you can provide any further clarity on why this would be.  I wanted 
to check with you before I had another discussion with [Heineman].”  The AC Chair replied that he 
“[could] not provide any clarity” and expressed concern that one of the audit committee members 
(the “AC Member”) “seems to be tied in with this group.”  The AC Member had been appointed 
by Pence in connection with the PSQ transaction in July.   
        
       29.    Henaghan replied to the AC Chair the following day, November 25, 2009, that he 
had spoken to Heineman that morning and Heineman indicated that Pence and the AC Member 
“were taking the lead on this as they have a previous working relationship with the bank.”  
Henaghan also noted that Heineman, however, had “disagreed with the fact that the CD would be 
‘paid back in installments’” and had “indicated that the proceeds of the CD would be in the 
Company’s bank account by Monday.”  
        
       30.    By the following Monday, November 30, 2009, GEE still had not obtained the $2.3 
million in proceeds of the purported CD from PAB.  That day, Pence, Heineman, and Zizza 
attended a GEE board of directors meeting.  Zizza, who had no formal role at GEE at this time, 
attended as an “invited guest.”  The board minutes indicate that the AC Chair explained that the 
Company’s Form 10-K had not yet been filed because BDO’s “final” opinion was predicated on 
the satisfactory accounting for the PAB CD and an explanation for where GEE’s funds had been 
since the CD matured on October 21.  During this November 30, 2009, board meeting, the AC 
Member stated he believed that the situation occurred as a result of administrative errors on the 
part of the Bank, and Pence said that the AC Member had agreed to pursue the matter with PAB.  
Neither Pence nor Heineman mentioned anything about GEE selling or assigning the purported CD 
               5
to a third party.   

       31.    By December 3, 2009, BDO learned that GEE had received four transfers from 
SDH and Oxygen totaling $1 million.  On December 3, 2009, the AC Member, who had been 
tasked by Pence with contacting PAB about the purported CD, told the AC Chair and BDO 
engagement partner Henaghan that PAB was sending GEE the $2.3 million proceeds of the 
purported CD.  The AC Member also told Henaghan that the Bank had made an “administrative 
error” and would provide a short apology note.    
        
       32.    After consulting with fellow BDO partners Rainis and Gerace, Henaghan sent 
GEE’s AC Chair an email on December 4, 2009, summarizing the open items requiring resolution 
prior to the issuance of BDO’s audit report:  (1) the purported CD; (2) identification of potential 

                                                 
5
 BDO engagement partner Henaghan       and concurring partner Rainis confirmed in the workpaper 
index that they  reviewed all of the minutes for the GEE  board and audit committee meetings 
discussing the purported CD issue.  

                                                  

                                                9

related parties to Pence; and (3) additional subsequent event procedures.  The email begins by 
noting that after the CD had matured in October 2009, when the GEE CFO had contacted the 
Bank, a PAB representative informed the GEE CFO that there was no record of the purported CD 
and that after some investigation by the AC Member, “in late November it was determined that the 
funds would be returned to GEE in installments.”  The email then notes that GEE had received the 
following wire transfers:  (i) November 24:  $300,000 wire transfer from SDH; (ii) November 25:  
$300,000 wire transfer from Oxygen; (iii) November 27:  $300,000 wire transfer from SDH; and 
(iv) December 1:  $100,000 wire transfer from Oxygen.  Henaghan’s email then noted that he had 
discussed the matter with Heineman and Pence, who both referred him to the AC Member who 
was working directly with PAB on the matter, and that the AC Member left him a voicemail 
“indicating the bank continues to put money against the CD they owe [GEE] and it should be fully 
repaid by the close of business on Monday, Dec. 7” and that the Bank would provide a short 
apology note.  Henaghan’s email continued:    

       [G]iven the highly unusual nature of this issue and the significant amount of time it 
       is taking to recover the funds, it is critical that we understand both the nature of the 
       administrative error as well as the underlying cause of this error....  As I have never 
       encountered such an issue with a bank or CD and any reasonable person (including 
       the PCAOB or SEC) would certainly question such an issue, I need to be in a 
       position to fully explain exactly what occurred…. As such, from an audit 
       perspective I will require the following prior to issuance of the fiscal 2009 financial 
       statements: 

               -Source documents (bank statements, etc.) showing the flow of funds from 
               the closing of the PSQ transaction through the date the funds are fully 
               transferred to Chase bank in December 2009 (including an understanding of 
               where the CD funds were disbursed upon maturity of the CD in October) 

               -Explanation as to why the funds received in November and December are 
               being wire transferred from entities other than Park Avenue Bank 

               -To corroborate this documentation, we may request to meet with someone 
               at Park Avenue Bank to understand the nature of the administrative error 

               -A written report by management or others to fully explain the 
               circumstances surrounding the matter including steps [GEE] took to gain its 
               understanding of what transpired.... 

       Also, as the $2.3 million is critical to our assessment of the Company’s ability to 
       continue as a going concern, it is important for us to understand this situation so as 
       to gain comfort that the funds will remain available to the Company to fund 
       operations as needed. 
        
       33.    Henaghan’s December 4 email also noted as an open item that he had a 
conversation with Pence that day “to gain an understanding of other investments he has to make 
sure we have appropriately identified any potential related parties and may have a few follow up 

                                                  

                                                10 
---------------------Page 11---------------------

questions regarding that matter.”  One of the items Henaghan had spoken to Pence about was the 
ownership of River Falls Financial, of which Pence had indicated he was the 100% owner.    
        
       34.    Shortly after receiving it, the AC Chair forwarded Henaghan’s email to Heineman, 
Pence, the AC Member, the GEE CFO, and GEE’s board, noting:  “Multiple representatives of 
BDO have told me that they will not sign off on the GEE Audit . . . until they have sufficient 
documentation of what has transpired.  [BDO’s] position is that the Liabilities associated with a 
sign-off far exceed any past or potential future Audit Fees that [they] have received or will receive.  
The high level message is that a letter of apology from Park Avenue Bank will not be sufficient.”  
Henaghan received a copy of this email and replied to all:  “To clarify, [our] primary concern is 
getting an understanding of exactly what has occurred in order to allow us to complete our audit 
procedures.  As I am sure everyone would agree, what has transpired over the last few weeks with 
the funds at [PAB] has been highly unusual.  I know everyone has been working to resolve the 
issue.  However, time continues to pass and [GEE’s] filing deadline will be here before we know it.  
As such, I wanted to clarify the importance of appropriately addressing the issue as quickly as 
possible to allow us to complete the audit.”   
        
       35.    Later in the day on December 4, the AC Chair sent an email to Henaghan and 
Rainis summarizing his call with the AC Member, stating that when he spoke with the AC 
Member “he told me that [PAB] had reported these transaction [sic] to the FDIC and that the 
money sent to the various entities that are now sending GEE the money are sending us the banks 
money rather than sending it back to the bank.”  The AC Chair continued:  “This makes absolutely 
no sense.  It looks like [PAB] is on the verge of failing.  The FDIC and a bankruptcy estate are 
going to require [PAB] to collect every cent they can under loans or other arrangements to settle 
with the creditors of the bank before they send money to third parties.”   
        
       36.    The following day, on December 5, 2009, the AC Chair emailed GEE’s board and 
Heineman calling for a special audit committee meeting on December 9 because of “several 
unanswered questions related to $2.3 million of the Company’s cash which supposedly was 
invested in a Certificate of Deposit (‘CD’) at Park Avenue Bank which will need to be answered 
before BDO will complete their Audit Report for the Company’s fiscal year ended September 30, 
2009.”  The AC Chair’s email noted several issues, including that (i) there was no account 
agreement with PAB or regular reporting on the CD; (ii) PAB did not remit the proceeds of the CD 
into GEE’s operating account when it reached its maturity date on October 21, 2009; (iii) PAB 
provided no explanation to the GEE CFO when he attempted to investigate; and (iv) the AC 
Member who took the lead on this matter with PAB “was informed on or about November 21, 
2009 that the funds would be returned to [GEE] in a series of deposits.”  The email also provided a 
chart of seven wire transfers totaling $1.7 million, which included the four noted in Henaghan’s 
December 4 email plus a December 2, 2009, wire transfer from Oxygen for $100,000, a December 
2, 2009, wire transfer from River Falls Financial of $300,000, and a December 3, 2009, wire 
transfer from River Falls Financial also for $300,000.  The address listed for both SDH and River 
Falls Financial on each of their wire transfers in the chart was 11921 Brinley Ave, Louisville, KY.  
BDO’s engagement partner Henaghan received a copy of the AC Chair’s December 5 email and 
forwarded it to Rainis, Gerace, and BDO’s general counsel.   
        

                                                 

                                                11 
---------------------Page 12---------------------

       37.    River Falls Financial was the entity that Henaghan had just been told was 100% 
owned by Pence.  BDO had also learned in conducting background investigations that Associate-1 
and Heineman were co-managers of River Falls Financial.   
        
       38.    On December 4 and December 9, 2009, GEE received two additional wire transfers 
from River Falls Financial for $300,000 each, bringing the total amount received by GEE from 
River Falls Financial to $1.2 million and the total of the nine wire transfers to $2.3 million, the 
same amount that Heineman had purported to invest in a CD.   
        
       39.    On December 8, the AC Chair emailed Henaghan, providing some links he 
suggested Henaghan review before Henaghan had a conversation with the AC Member and any 
representatives of PAB, “particularly the Anthony Huff links” and explained that he “met Anthony 
Huff when we went to New York” to negotiate PSQ’s acquisition.  The email included links to a 
press release announcing the Commission’s lawsuit against Huff, a link to Huff’s website noting 
the address 11921 Brinley Avenue, Louisville, KY in the text of the email, and a link to the 
website for Oxygen noting the identical address.  This is the same address that appeared in the 
wires sent to GEE by River Falls Financial and SDH, as noted in the AC Chair’s December 5 
email described in paragraph 36, above.  Also, Huff’s website at the time contained references to 
River Falls Investments, SDH, Oxygen, and O2HR.   
        
       40.    In addition to the background checks of Heineman and Associate-1 discussed in 
paragraph 26, on November 23 and December 21, Henaghan, Rainis, and Gerace participated in 
phone calls with Associate-1.  According to Henaghan’s notes of the calls, they discussed Huff’s 
connections to River Falls Financial and River Falls Investments and the Commission’s lawsuit 
against Huff “alleging fraudulent transfer of assets & non-disclosure of related party transactions.”  
Associate-1 told BDO that Huff’s wife was the original 100% owner of River Falls Financial 
before it was sold to Pence.  Associate-1 also told BDO that, through a family trust, Huff had a 
70% ownership interest in River Falls Investments.   
        
       41.    Also on December 8, 2009, the day before the special audit committee meeting, the 
AC Chair received an email from Heineman to the audit committee with several attachments.  
Heineman’s email purported to offer a new explanation for why GEE had received $2.3 million 
from the three entities rather than PAB.  Heineman claimed that he had negotiated an assignment 
agreement with the manager of River Falls Investments (Associate-1), who “offered to purchase” 
the purported CD from GEE at face value.  Heineman also attached to his email an unsigned, draft 
assignment agreement and a letter from Heineman to PAB, dated July 21, 2009, that purportedly 
authorized the $2.3 million CD investment.  Heineman’s email also attached a July 2009 monthly 
statement for GEE’s operating account at PAB, which included the description of the $2.3 million 
withdrawal as a debit on July 23 with a debit memo stating in handwriting:  “To:  Park Avenue 
Insurance, See Attachment Approval, $2,300,000.00.”   
        
       42.    The AC Chair responded to Heineman’s email that day, stating: “Given the chain of 
event[s] you described below, why was GEE not informed immediately when River Falls 
Investments purchased the CD and why are we just now learning that a law firm has been engaged 
to document the assignment of the CD?  We have been asking questions about the CD now for 

                                                 

                                               12 
---------------------Page 13---------------------

nearly a month.”  BDO engagement partner Henaghan received a copy of Heineman’s email with 
attachments and the AC Chair’s reply email.  On a printout of the AC Chair’s reply email, BDO 
engagement partner Henaghan wrote “$ Anthony Huff.”   
        
       43.    Henaghan also exchanged emails with the AC Chair later that day, noting his 
agreement with the AC Chair’s questions to Heineman and that “the sale of the CD would 
constitute a related party transaction which typically should be approved by the board.”  The AC 
Chair replied to Henaghan that he had just spoken to Heineman and Heineman “claims that RFI 
(River Falls Investment) is 100% owned by [Associate-1] and is not related to River Falls 
Financial Services or any of the other entities.”  Henaghan replied, “That is consistent with what [] 
Pence told me in my conversation with him.  The common names are a little strange though.”   
 
       44.    Prior to the December 9, 2009, special audit committee meeting, BDO had learned 
of several indications of fraud relating to the purported CD.  Moreover, during the 2009 audit of 
GEE,  BDO became aware of multiple indications that the purported assignment agreement with 
River Falls Investments was a related party transaction, including:  
        
     the common names of River Falls Investments (purportedly owned by a Huff family trust 
       and Associate-1) and River Falls Financial (purportedly owned by Pence, GEE’s 
       chairman); 

     River Falls Financial had sent GEE $1.2 million in four installments in connection with the 
       assignment agreement ; 

     Heineman and Associate-1 were co-managers of River Falls Financial; 

     Associate-1 was a signatory for GEE’s operating account at PAB from July to September 
       2009, when the $2.3 million was purportedly invested in a CD; 

     Heineman’s email address was rheineman@riverfallsfinancialgroup.com; 

     The validity of a business purpose for River Falls Investments to purchase the CD at face 
       value was questionable given that (i) PAB stated that it had no record of the purported CD 
       in its system; and (ii) GEE did not have a binding agreement in its possession concerning 
       its purported purchase of the CD with PAB; 

     River Falls Investments was not listed in GEE’s banking records as the originator of the 
       wire transfers that were purported to be in connection with the assignment agreement.  
       GEE received the payments from SDH, River Falls Financial, and Oxygen—all of which 
       were made before a binding agreement with River Falls Investments was executed; and 

     River Falls Financial, River Falls Investments, SDH, Oxygen, and Huff all shared a 
       common address:  11921 Brinley Avenue in Louisville, KY 40234. 

       45.    Prior to the GEE special audit committee meeting scheduled for December 9, 2009, 
Henaghan alerted Rainis, Gerace, and BDO’s Midwest Regional Business Line Leader (the “BDO 

                                                 

                                               13 
---------------------Page 14---------------------

Midwest Leader”) of Heineman’s new explanation concerning the assignment agreement and each 
of them attended the meeting.  According to the audit committee meeting minutes: 
        
     Henaghan expressed concern that BDO still did not have a clear understanding of the 
       purported CD transaction.   

     Henaghan said that BDO needed to understand the nature of the purported administrative 
       errors at PAB that he had been told were responsible for the lack of proper documentation 
       regarding the CD transaction.  Henaghan also explained that BDO required documentation 
       validating the banking transactions, and an explanation as to why there was no existence of 
       an account agreement with the Bank or no record of the CD being at the bank. 

     The BDO Midwest Leader said he believed members of GEE’s senior management 
       appeared hesitant to provide information related to these transactions.   

     Henaghan stated that the assignment agreement did not resolve the outstanding issues as 
       BDO still needed to know what transpired within PAB and make a determination of 
       whether the assignment agreement with River Falls Investments was a related party 
       transaction. 

     BDO also advised that although the assignment agreement “may reduce or eliminate the 
       need for going concern disclosure, it would increase the requirement that management 
       provide sufficient disclosure regarding any related party conflicts.”   

       46.    On December 14, 2009, GEE’s outside counsel sent PAB a formal letter requesting 
all documentation and information concerning the purported CD.  BDO received a copy of this 
letter.  PAB’s December 16, 2009, response, also received by BDO, provided only documents 
relating to GEE’s checking account and did not provide any documents or other information about 
the purported CD.  The checking account documentation, however, indicated that only 
Associate-1, the GEE CFO, and Pence were authorized signers on GEE’s account from July to 
September 2009—not Heineman—and the checking account statements reflected a debit memo for 
the transfer of $2.3 million of GEE’s cash to Park Avenue Insurance on July 23, 2009.   

       47.    On Friday, December 18, 2009, BDO received a letter from GEE’s general counsel 
that attached the final assignment agreement, dated December 11, and a letter from Associate-1 
claiming that the $2.3 million sent to GEE by SDH, Oxygen, and River Falls Financial originated 
from River Falls Investments and its “wholly owned subsidiaries or affiliates.”  The letter 
concluded:  “The entirety, sans interest, used by the Company for the purchase of the CD was 
received into the Company’s Chase bank account….  Since time is certainly of the essence to 
complete the audit work for the Form 10-K to be filed by the Company no later than December 31, 
2009, we believe that any open concerns your firm had with respect to the source of the initial 
concerns over the CD are now resolved.”  The letter did not provide any additional information 
concerning what had happened with the purported CD and why Associate-1 and River Falls 
Investments would pay face value for the purported CD which PAB had not honored and had no 
records to support.  

                                                 

                                               14 
---------------------Page 15---------------------

       48.    Following the receipt of the December 18 letter, BDO partners Henaghan, Rainis, 
and Gerace requested consultation with Graul, BDO’s national director of accounting and risk 
management partner, Hambleton, BDO’s national director of SEC practice, and BDO’s general 
counsel.  After discussion of the situation, these BDO partners agreed they should inform GEE that 
the December 18 letter did not fully address the questions BDO had raised and demand that the 
audit committee commission an independent investigation to determine exactly what happened.   

G.     BDO DEMANDED AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION AND, SHORTLY 
       THEREAFTER, WITHDREW THE DEMAND  
        
       49.    On Monday, December 21, 2009, Henaghan sent an email to Graul and Hambleton, 
copying Rainis and Gerace, stating:  “This morning we informed the [AC Chair] that we will 
require an independent investigation of the CD matter in order to conclude the audit of General 
Employment (consistent with our discussions with you on Friday.)  Attached is our proposed 
written communication.”  The five-page draft communication described in detail much of the 
inconsistent evidence BDO had received concerning the purported CD and the purported 
assignment agreement with River Falls Investments and also included a number of proposed 
questions.  Graul responded:   
        
       We do not owe the Board any explanation other than our “audit” of the CD 
       in question is incomplete because we have been unable to obtain sufficient 
       evidence to support the existence and ownership of this asset.  You could 
       say that we have obtained bits and pieces of evidence[] but are not satisfied 
       with the sufficiency of such evidence to support our opinion on the financial 
       statements.  You could also say that because of the unusual circumstances 
       surrounding the evidence provided thus far, we concluded that the Board 
       should undertake a full investigation of the matter.   

       50.    Later that day, Hambleton replied to Graul’s email, asking whether they “should go 
into detail of the issues in the letter.”  Graul responded to Hambleton:  “Short of saying we think 
there is fraud, the point is we have been looking for support for months and don’t have anything 
satisfactory to support a final opinion.  If we give a list of questions, we’ll get answers to those 
questions and still not know what is really going on.  An independent investigation is the only way 
to get to the bottom of this.  The list doesn’t look like it would get us there.” 

       51.    Also on December 21, 2009, BDO partners Henaghan, Rainis, and Gerace 
questioned Associate-1 about the assignment agreement and Huff’s involvement with GEE, River 
Falls Financial, and River Falls Investments.  According to summary notes of the call, Associate-
1’s explanation for why River Falls Financial, purportedly owned by Pence, wired payments of 
$300,000 each to GEE on four days (December 2, 3, 4, and 9), was that the funds were “initially 
inadvertently transferred to the [River Falls Financial] account rather than the GEE account.”  
Associate-1 also informed BDO that Huff’s wife was the original 100% owner of River Falls 
Financial and that Pence acquired the company in 2009.  The notes also reflect that Associate-1 
conveyed that through a trust Huff has an ownership interest in River Falls Investments.  
Associate-1 further told BDO that he was familiar with Park Avenue Insurance and he believes it 
“is insolvent at this point.”     

                                                 

                                               15 
---------------------Page 16---------------------

       52.    Ultimately it was determined that the detailed letter would be sent and, early on 
December 22, 2009, Henaghan sent GEE’s AC Chair a five-page letter, dated December 21, 2009, 
in substantially the same form as Henaghan had internally circulated earlier.  Henaghan’s letter 
identified a number of inconsistencies in the audit evidence BDO had received regarding the 
purported CD: 

     BDO had not received “sufficient audit evidence” to support the existence of a CD 
       investment as of September 30, 2009.  The questions raised in regards to the CD at both the 
       November and December audit committee meetings remained unaddressed.   

     BDO had not received an adequate explanation from PAB as to the whereabouts of the $2.3 
       million after July 23, 2009, because the Bank claimed to have no record of a CD in its 
       system.  PAB never “repaid the CD proceeds or provided an adequate explanation 
       regarding the status of the CD.”   

     BDO had “requested (but not been granted) an opportunity to speak directly with [PAB] 
                             6
       regarding this matter.”  

     The July 2009 PAB statement “indicates the amount was transferred to Park Avenue 
       Insurance.  We would like to understand why it appears that the funds were transferred to 
       Park Avenue Insurance and were not invested into a CD. . . .  [M]anagement has provided 
       no explanation for this.  The documentation also appears to indicate that prior to September 
       2009, [Associate-1] was an authorized signor on the Company’s operating account.”  

     Heineman’s statements to BDO:  (1) claiming on November 23 that “the issue would be 
       resolved and the funds deposited in the Company’s bank account within a few days”—
       which did not happen; (2) stating on November 25 that the money would not be “paid back 
       in installments”—which did happen; (3) claiming GEE would have the proceeds by 
       November 30—which did not happen; (4) asserting on December 8 that he negotiated the 
       assignment with Associate-1—but “during [BDO’s] earlier discussions with Mr. Heineman 
       he had represented that he was not involved in the process of resolving the issues related to 
       the CD.”  

     BDO received conflicting reports regarding the return of the CD funds:  (1) the AC 
       Member stated on December 4 that “the bank continues to put money against the CD they 
       owe the Company and it should be fully repaid”; (2) Pence and Heineman referred BDO to 
       the AC Member; and (3) “In all discussions leading up to December 7, 2009, no one ever 
       indicated that the CD had been assigned to [Associate-1].”   

     “At the December 9, 2009 audit committee meeting, general counsel and one audit 
       committee member requested that BDO not be present for the discussion regarding 
       the CD matter.” 
                                                 
6
  BDO never  contacted PAB or   spoke to anyone from PAB     after learning that PAB failed to 
repay the CD proceeds  .   

                                                  

                                                16 
---------------------Page 17---------------------

     BDO had not received a clear explanation as to why River Falls Investments would 
       purchase the CD that the Bank has said does not exist, why River Falls Investments 
       would transfer funds to GEE before an assignment agreement had been executed, 
       and whether Associate-1’s intent to sell companies to GEE was related to his 
       agreement to purchase the CD.   

     “Approximately $900,000 of the proceeds recovered by the Company was received 
       from River Falls Financial Services.  [BDO] had previously been informed that 
       River Falls Financial Services was 100% owned by Steve Pence.  However, in a 
       December 18, 2009 telephone conversation with Steve Pence, he was unable to 
       explain why these amounts were transferred from River Falls Financial Services (as 
       the proceeds were for [Associate-1’s] purchase of the CD).” 
        
       53.    Henaghan’s letter indicated that he included specific facts in the letter “to illustrate 
that it appears that management has not been forthcoming with information surrounding this 
matter.  This fact pattern has caused us to raise the level of scrutiny surrounding this issue.” 
        
       54.    At the end of his letter, Henaghan stated that BDO did not have sufficient audit 
evidence at that time to formally conclude the audit and demanded an independent investigation: 
 
       While BDO recognizes that the issue related to the CD may be the result of 
       potential administrative or other errors at [PAB], we do not believe we have been 
       provided sufficient audit evidence to formally conclude on this matter at this point.  
       As a result of the fact that almost one month has passed since the first audit 
       committee meeting discussing this matter, that it appears management has not been 
       fully forthcoming on how it was resolving the issue, and certain question remain 
       unanswered, we will require the audit committee to commission a full investigation 
       of this matter prior to the completion of our audit for the year ended September 30, 
       2009.  This investigation should be conducted by an independent firm that is 
       acceptable to our firm and should address the following unexplained matters: 

         Why would the Company maintain $2.3 million at Park Avenue Bank in direct 
           violation of its own investment policy? 
         Why was [Associate-1] an authorized signor on the Company’s account at Park 
           Avenue Bank? 
         What happened to the CD? We would like an explanation for all of the facts 
           noted above surrounding the situation. 
         Why did the Company not pursue legal action against the bank and report the 
           situation to the FDIC when the bank failed to reimburse the Company when the 
           CD matured? 
         Why would Mr. Heineman & Mr. Pence represent they were unaware of the 
           status of the CD resolution and why funds were being received from entities 
           other than Park Avenue Bank when it appears they were aware of the 
           assignment agreement with [Associate-1]? 

                                                 

                                                17 
---------------------Page 18---------------------

         Why would [Associate-1] be willing to purchase an asset whose value is in 
           question when he has no relationship to the Company? 
         Why did River Falls Financial Services reimburse the Company for the CD if 
           they did not have any relationship with [Associate-1] and were not a party to the 
           assignment agreement? 
         We would like a clear understanding of the relationships between [Associate-1], 
           Mr. Pence and Mr. Heineman and any entities where they may have joint 
           ownership? 
         What is the relationship between [Associate-1], Mr. Pence, Mr. Heineman and 
           Park Avenue Bank? 

       Please note that the issues listed above represent[] some of the areas of concern 
       based on our current understanding of the facts.  The above items should not be 
       considered an all-inclusive list and the investigation should not be limited to the 
       above identified items.  We may identify additional questions and require additional 
       audit evidence based on the results of the investigation.  BDO recommends that this 
       investigation be commissioned as soon as possible. 
 
       55.    On the evening of December 22, 2009, BDO learned that the audit committee 
meeting that was scheduled for the following day had been cancelled, Zizza, an advisor to Pence 
who had attended GEE board meetings through the fall of 2009, would be taking over as CEO, and 
that Pence and Associate-1 intended to prepare written responses to each of the issues identified in 
the December 21 letter.  In email exchanges that evening and the following morning regarding 
these events, Henaghan, Gerace, Hambleton, and the BDO Midwest Leader agreed that BDO 
should communicate to GEE in writing that BDO “will continue to require an independent 
investigation.”   
        
       56.    Following Zizza’s appointment as GEE’s new CEO, BDO partners Henaghan, 
Rainis, Gerace, and the BDO Midwest Leader spoke to Zizza and the AC Chair on December 24, 
2009.  A senior partner in BDO’s New York office (the “NY Partner”) also attended the call 
because he handled some of Zizza’s other business relationships with BDO, including audit or tax 
work for Zizza’s private company and three public companies for which Zizza served as a board 
member.  Henaghan later wrote a memo describing the December 24 call, stating that Zizza 
“requested that BDO conclude the audit without the need for an independent investigation” 
because of “the change in management and the fact that the Company had recovered full control of 
the $2.3 million in question” and that the AC Chair agreed.  The memo also indicates that both 
Zizza and the AC Chair “acknowledged that some inappropriate actions were taken within the 
Company and that it was likely that even more inappropriate actions were taken at the Bank” and 
that both “felt that with [Heineman’s] removal from the management team, the inappropriate 
actions within the Company would stop.”   
        
       57.    Also on December 24, BDO partners Henaghan, Rainis, and Gerace had a 
telephone conversation with Pence, Zizza, and the AC Chair.  According to a memo Henaghan 
later wrote describing this call, Pence indicated he asked GEE to move its business to PAB because 
of his prior working relationship as an attorney for Antonucci, PAB’s then-President, and 

                                                 

                                               18 
---------------------Page 19---------------------

Associate-1’s association with PAB as a customer.  The memo also indicates that Pence had told 
BDO that the reason he represented he was unaware of the status of the CD resolution and why 
funds were being received from entities other than PAB was because “he was unaware of the 
assignment agreement until after the funds were returned to the Company.”  The memo further 
noted that Associate-1’s explanation for why River Falls Financial transferred funds to GEE was 
because River Falls Financial “also has an operating account” at the same bank and “[t]he funds 
were transferred from one of his companies to [River Falls Financial] in error,” and as such, River 
Falls Financial “then had to transfer the funds to GEE.”      
        
       58.    After these calls with Zizza, Pence, and the AC Chair, Henaghan sent Rainis, Graul, 
Gerace, Hambleton, the NY Partner, the BDO Midwest Leader, and BDO’s general counsel an 
email on December 24, 2009, asking for their availability for a call and stating he was drafting a 
memo summarizing current facts.  Graul responded:  “Unless there is something new that hasn’t 
been discussed in the last few calls, what’s the purpose?”  The NY Partner replied:  “The purpose 
is to try to salvage an account where they made [] changes in the management because of the 
alleged wrongdoing.”  Graul responded:  “Did they change the guy that can’t support the $2 
million that supposedly was put into company?  What about the two audit committee members that 
stalled the investigation and the lawyer that wouldn’t let us participate in a board meeting to 
preserve privilege.  There’s something funny going on here.”  The NY Partner replied that he had 
no disagreement with Graul on the last point. 

       59.    BDO’s 2009 Assurance Manual required Henaghan to consult with Graul, 
Hambleton, and Gerace in the circumstances presented here.  The Manual required the engagement 
partner seeking consultation to prepare a memorandum concerning all consultations, which should, 
among other things, define the issues; “identify client source documents/evidence reviewed”; 
summarize the proper accounting treatment; summarize the impact on the financial statement 
presentation and disclosure; and describe any alternative solutions considered and why they were 
rejected.  Finally, BDO’s 2009 Assurance Manual required the memorandum to be sent to all 
consultants, who “should acknowledge their agreement with the memorandum.” 

       60.    Early in the morning on December 28, Henaghan sent a draft memo to Rainis, 
Graul, Gerace, Hambleton, the NY Partner, the BDO Midwest Leader, and BDO’s general counsel.  
The memo summarized BDO’s calls with Zizza, the AC Chair, Pence, and Associate-1, and 
attempted to answer the questions posed in Henaghan’s letter to the AC Chair dated December 21, 
2009.  The memo concluded:  “the engagement team believes it is appropriate to reconsider the 
need for an independent investigation and as such is requesting a consultation on this matter.”   

       61.    That same day, Henaghan, Graul, Gerace, Hambleton, the NY Partner, the BDO 
Midwest Leader, and BDO’s general counsel discussed GEE for approximately one hour.  Despite 
the existence of multiple, unanswered questions, they ultimately agreed to drop the demand for an 
independent investigation if GEE agreed to include commentary on two material weaknesses in 
internal controls, including certain circumstances surrounding the purported CD, in a Form 8-K 
and that Associate-1 would not become part of management, among other things.  A memo later 
written by Henaghan to document the discussion notes as considerations, among other things, that 
Zizza—whom BDO trusted—had replaced Heineman as CEO and that the AC Chair, who had 
initially supported the independent investigation, no longer believed that it was required. 

                                                 

                                               19 
---------------------Page 20---------------------

       62.    Following their call, the NY Partner spoke to Zizza and Henaghan spoke to the AC 
Chair about the statements BDO wanted made in the Form 8-K and Associate-1’s contemplated 
role with GEE.  Henaghan emailed an update to Rainis, Graul, Gerace, Hambleton, the NY 
Partner, the BDO Midwest Leader, and BDO’s general counsel, stating that the AC Chair indicated 
that GEE was contemplating an acquisition that would make Associate-1 an approximate 20% 
shareholder of GEE, but not an officer, director, or part of management.  Graul responded: “I don’t 
like it but won’t object provided [that Associate-1] is not a board member and has no managerial 
responsibilities, even with respect to the business he is selling.  Please make it perfectly clear that 
this is the last accommodation that I am willing to make from a risk management perspective.”   

       63.    Also following their December 28 call, Hambleton sent an email to the other BDO 
partners asking whether they were comfortable with the classification of the $2.3 million as cash at 
September 30.  Henaghan responded:  “we have a confirmation from Park Ave Bank & the 
subsequent execution and funding of the assignment agreement as evidence of the existence of the 
CD at 9/30.”  Henaghan did not mention any of the inconsistent evidence that he identified in his 
letter to the AC Chair dated December 21, 2009, and that indicated that no such CD or other cash 
equivalent existed as of September 30, 2009.  Neither Hambleton nor any of the other BDO 
partners responded or commented on these omissions.   

       64.    BDO provided a draft Form 8-K disclosure to GEE, and reviewed and agreed to the 
language ultimately included in GEE’s Form 8-K filed on December 30, 2009.  The Form 8-K 
disclosed Heineman’s resignation, Zizza’s appointment as CEO, and the fact that Zizza was paid 
$20,000 per month since March 2009 to consult for Pence.  The Form 8-K also stated:   
 
       In July 2009, the Registrant purchased a $2.3 million certificate of deposit (“CD”) 
       at a New York bank.  When the CD matured in October 2009, the bank did not 
       timely credit the proceeds of the CD to the Registrant’s account.  Although the 
       Registrant has made a formal inquiry of the bank, to date the Company has not 
       received an adequate explanation for the bank’s non-performance relating to the 
       CD.  In December 2009, the Registrant was reimbursed in full through a non-
       recourse assignment of the CD for face value to an unrelated party, who has other 
       business interests with the bank.  The purchaser of the CD is neither an employee 
       nor a director of the Registrant. 
 
       65.    The Form 8-K also disclosed two material weaknesses:  (1) “the size of the New 
York bank from which the CD was purchased did not meet the minimum requirements of [GEE]’s 
investment policy”; and (2) the Company “authorized an individual that was neither an employer 
nor a director as an authorized signor on the Registrant’s bank account.”  The Form 8-K did not 
indicate that Associate-1 was both the authorized signatory and the purportedly “unrelated party” 
who purchased the purported CD.   
 
       66.    On January 4, 2010, Henaghan sent an email to the other BDO partners attaching 
the Form 8-K, the December 21, 2009, letter to the AC Chair demanding an independent 
investigation, Heineman’s resignation email, and a final memo discussing BDO’s calls with the 
AC Chair, Pence, Zizza, and Associate-1 and concluding that BDO should issue its opinion on 
GEE’s financial statements.  The final memo noted that Zizza and the AC Chair “acknowledged 

                                                 

                                               20 
---------------------Page 21---------------------

that some inappropriate actions were taken within the Company and that it was likely that even 
more inappropriate actions were taken at the Bank….  Both men also acknowledged that they felt 
that with [Heineman’s] removal from the management team, the inappropriate actions within the 
Company would stop.”  The memo noted that “without the cooperation of [Heineman] and the 
Bank – neither of which anyone was likely to obtain, it was highly unlikely that the motivations or 
even all of the actions would ever be learned.”  BDO did not attempt to contact Heineman 
following his resignation nor did BDO attempt to contact PAB at any time after this issue arose.   
        
       67.    The memo also stated that Zizza “represented to BDO that [Associate-1] will not 
become an employee or director of the Company” and concluded:  “To the extent any new adverse 
information related to the transaction comes to our attention we will again consult with BDO’s risk 
management and National SEC groups in regards to continued client retention.”  Rainis, Graul, 
Gerace, and Hambleton each reviewed the memo and concurred with the decision to drop the 
demand for an independent investigation.  BDO’s general counsel also agreed with the approach 
outlined in the memo. 
        
       68.    On January 5, 2010, after BDO had already decided that GEE’s Form 8-K 
disclosure concerning the purported CD was adequate and informed GEE that it would withdraw 
its demand for an investigation and issue an unqualified audit opinion, Hambleton asked BDO’s 
general counsel, Henaghan, Rainis, Graul, Gerace, and the NY Partner:  “I want to make sure we 
believe the company’s response is a sufficient response to a potential illegal act.  Although we 
didn’t specifically say we thought there was a potential illegal act in the [December 21] letter, we 
did include enough issues that would lead someone to that view as does the memo’s statement 
about some ‘inappropriate actions.’”  BDO’s general counsel responded:  “I do believe the 
company’s response was appropriate under the circumstances.” 
        
       69.    On January 8, 2010, GEE filed its Form 10-K, which classified the $2.3 million 
purported CD as a cash equivalent and stated in footnote disclosure to the financial statements: 
        
       In July 2009, the Company purchased a $2,300,000 certificate of deposit (“CD”) at 
       a New York bank.  When the CD matured in October 2009, the bank did not timely 
       credit the proceeds of the CD to the Company’s account.  Although the Company 
       has made a formal inquiry of the bank, to date the Company has not received an 
       adequate explanation for the bank’s non-performance relating to the CD.  In 
       December 2009, the Company was reimbursed in full through a non-recourse 
       assignment of the CD for face value to an unrelated party, who has other business 
       interests with the bank.  The purchaser of the CD is neither an employee nor a 
       director of the Company.   

       70.    GEE’s Form 10-K filed on January 8, 2010 contained an audit report from BDO 
that stated BDO’s audits were conducted “in accordance with the standards of the Public 
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)” and that GEE’s financial statements 
presented fairly, in all material respects, the company’s position and results at September 30, 2009, 
in conformity with GAAP.

H.     IN 2010, BDO LEARNED OF FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS IN A CRIMINAL 
       COMPLAINT AGAINST THE PAB PRESIDENT ALLEGING THAT THE 
       PURPORTED CD DID NOT EXIST 
        
       71.    On January 19, 2010, just days after BDO issued its unqualified opinion and GEE 
filed its 2009 Form 10-K, Henaghan sent an email to Rainis, Graul, Gerace, Hambleton, the BDO 
Midwest Leader, and NY Partner attaching a January 12, 2010, Grand Jury Subpoena, issued to the 
AC Chair seeking his appearance and production of “any and all documents relating to any account 
maintained at Park Avenue Bank.”   
        
       72.    On March 13, 2010, the United States of America filed a 44-page criminal 
Complaint against former PAB president Antonucci (the “Antonucci Complaint”), alleging a 
scheme and conspiracy involving a $6.5 million round-trip transaction in which GEE’s $2.3 
million was diverted as part of the conspiracy.  Huff, Heineman, and Pence are referred to and 
identifiable as designated “co-conspirator[s] not named herein” in certain aspects of that 
conspiracy.  The allegations in the Antonucci Complaint contained several details that indicated 
that GEE did not have a CD with PAB, that River Falls Financial, River Falls Investments, 
Oxygen, SDH, and PSQ were related parties, and that Heineman had authorized the money to be 
transferred to Park Avenue Insurance as part of the conspiracy, and not to purchase a CD: 
        
     “To hide the improper diversion of GEE’s funds from GEE’s auditors and Board of 
       Directors, [Antonucci] and others created a counterfeit certificate of deposit [], falsely 
       representing that GEE’s $2.3 million had been invested in a 90-day certificate of deposit at 
       the Bank.  In fact, and as [Antonucci] well knew, there was no $2.3 million CD.” 

     GEE’s $2.3 million had been transferred to Park Avenue Insurance, which was controlled 
       by Antonucci.  According to the Bank records, Heineman authorized this transfer. 

     Antonucci fraudulently signed the BDO confirmation of the $2.3 million CD, when 
       Antonucci knew it did not exist. 
        
The Antonucci Complaint further identified several “Oxygen-related entities” as participants in the 
conspiracy, including, River Falls Financial (which Pence said he owned), PSQ (Pence’s entity that 
purchased the majority stake in GEE), and Oxygen and SDH—two companies that paid GEE 
purportedly under the assignment agreement with River Falls Investments (which Associate-1 said 
he and a Huff family trust owned).  It further alleged that a group of five associates (including Huff 
and Pence) were listed on some of the accounts of the Oxygen-related entities, which shared a 
common address in Louisville, Kentucky.   
        
       73.    On April 27, 2010, Henaghan sent an email attaching the Antonucci Complaint to 
Rainis, Graul, Gerace, Hambleton, the BDO Midwest Leader, and BDO’s general counsel.  
Henaghan’s email also attached a March 10, 2010 Grand Jury Subpoena issued to GEE, requesting 
(i) documents relating to Huff, Pence, Heineman, the purported CD, SDH, Oxygen, O2HR, and 
River Falls Financial and (ii) documents reflecting any payments to Heineman, Pence, Associate-1, 
or the AC Member.  Henaghan further attached a client retention memo addressed to Graul, 
Hambleton, Gerace, the BDO Midwest Leader, and BDO’s general counsel.  The memo stated: 
                                                

                                              22

“As I believe everyone is aware, in March 2010, Charles Antonucci, the president of Park Avenue 
Bank was arrested related to allegations of criminal acts in his role as bank president, including 
signing a counterfeit CD and our confirmation when he had in fact diverted the funds for his own 
personal use.”  The memo also noted that Pence was an unnamed co-conspirator.  The memo 
concluded that the engagement team recommended that BDO continue its relationship with GEE 
because, among other factors, “Pence has not been formally charged yet with any criminal wrong-
doing.”  However, the memo did not address what impact the Antonucci Complaint’s allegations 
might have on the representations contained in GEE’s financial statements (issued two months 
before the complaint) concerning the purported CD. 
        
       74.    On April 28, 2010, Graul responded to Henaghan’s email requesting that he obtain 
additional information concerning certain allegations in connection with client retention concerns.  
Specifically, Graul indicated that Gerace had confirmed to him that “[w]hen the missing company 
funds were ‘dribbling’ in from other sources” those sources included entities linked to the 
conspiracy alleged in the Antonucci Complaint.  Graul asked Henaghan to determine (i) whether 
any related party transactions might involve the entities mentioned in the complaint; (ii) who 
authorized the funds to be paid to GEE from the “Oxygen-related entities” River Falls Financial, 
SDH, and Oxygen; and (iii) whether the AC Chair and Zizza are comfortable working with Pence 
because “the preponderance of the accusations seem pretty bad for Mr. Pence.”  Hambleton 
responded to all, stating:  “I agree with [Graul].  It seems there are more potential connections 
here.”  However, neither Graul, Hambleton, Gerace, nor Rainis ever followed up with Henaghan to 
learn whether he had identified those “potential connections.”   
        
       75.    In a May 25, 2010, email, Henaghan told Zizza that he would like to discuss certain 
issues regarding the Antonucci Complaint.  Henaghan wrote that he wanted to discuss the 
allegations that “Pence purchased a 25% interest in Bedford Consulting from Antonucci for $6.5 
million in what the complaint describes as an ‘artifice designed to cover up the true source of the 
$6.5 million.’”  Henaghan also wrote:  “The Complaint indicates that River Falls is owned by 
Pence, [Associate-1], and Heineman.  All previous information disclosed to us by Heineman and 
Pence indicated that Pence owned 100% of River Falls.”  He further noted that the Complaint 
indicated that PSQ borrowed money from River Falls to buy the GEE shares.  Henaghan’s email to 
Zizza did not address the allegations in the Antonucci Complaint denying the existence of the 
purported CD or indicating related party issues concerning the funds received by the “Oxygen-
related entities.”   
        
       76.    On June 1, 2010, in connection with the allegations contained in the Antonucci 
Complaint, an Assistant United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York interviewed 
Henaghan in detail about BDO’s 2009 audit, including the information BDO received about the 
ownership structures of River Falls Financial, River Falls Investments, WTS, On-Site, Oxygen, 
and AIR. 
        
       77.    Other than Henaghan’s single discussion with Pence (who denied the allegations) 
and further communications with Zizza (who stated that he still trusted Pence), BDO did not 
perform any additional procedures specific to the allegations in the Antonucci Complaint 
concerning GEE, its chairman and former CEO, or the purported CD.  BDO’s workpapers do not 

                                                 

                                                23 
---------------------Page 24---------------------

include any information about what BDO did to investigate the allegation that PAB records 
indicated that Heineman authorized the transfer of $2.3 million to Park Avenue Insurance.  BDO’s 
workpapers also do not include any analysis of the impact on GEE’s financial statements if 
Heineman had conspired with Antonucci to steal GEE’s $2.3 million, by authorizing the transfer of 
the money to Antonucci’s company, Park Avenue Insurance, as alleged in the Antonucci 
Complaint.  The workpapers do not include an analysis of whether the assignment agreement with 
River Falls Investments, in which GEE received $2.3 million from SDH, Oxygen, or River Falls 
Financial, was a related party transaction.  In fact, Henaghan did not document any answers he 
received pursuant to his discussions with Pence or Zizza.  Moreover, the client retention memo and 
“matters for reviewer concern” memo retained in the workpapers for the 2010 audit make no 
reference to the Antonucci Complaint or guilty plea. 
        
       78.    In October 2010, Antonucci pled guilty to multiple criminal charges in a criminal 
information, including securities fraud, bank bribery, and embezzlement of bank funds.  As part of 
his guilty plea, Antonucci admitted that he and his co-conspirators caused GEE to use $2.3 million 
of its funds to make PAB whole on a loan PAB made to a company controlled by his co-
conspirators that had gone bankrupt, that the purported CD had never existed, and that he had 
signed a false confirmation that the bank had issued a CD to GEE that he then sent to BDO.  BDO 
learned of this guilty plea shortly thereafter. 
        
       79.    BDO also learned, through GEE’s November 2010 Form 8-K filing and publicly 
available information, that Pence purportedly sold PSQ to a person associated with Huff 
(“Associate-2”).  After Associate-2 became the majority owner of GEE, a BDO senior manager on 
the GEE audit noted that Google showed that Associate-2 was connected to O2HR, Huff, and 
Associate-1.  According to the Form 8-K, Associate-2 paid nothing for PSQ; he just assumed 
promissory notes issued by Pence to AIR for approximately $3 million, which funded PSQ’s 
purchase of the majority of GEE shares in July 2009.  Associate-1 had previously informed 
Henaghan in a December 21, 2009 email that AIR had “investments received and invested in” 
River Falls Investments, the entity that purchased the purported CD from GEE.   
        
       80.    Despite all of these additional indications of affiliation among AIR, River Falls 
Investments, River Falls Financial, Pence, Associate-1, and Huff, BDO did not perform additional 
audit procedures in 2010 to determine whether the purported purchase by River Falls Investments 
of the purported CD from GEE (i) was fairly characterized in GEE’s financial statements or (ii) 
should have been identified as a related party transaction in GEE’s financial statements.  Instead, 
BDO relied on GEE management and director representations that there were no undisclosed 
related party transactions.  BDO also relied on Associate-1’s representations although, as Graul 
acknowledged to Gerace and Henaghan on August 10, 2010:  “Anything and everything that 
involves [Associate-1] should be scrutinized carefully . . . [Associate-1] is not to be trusted and 
everyone on the engagement should be made aware of this.”   
 
       81.    GEE’s Form 10-K filed on December 28, 2010, for its fiscal year ended September 
30, 2010, classified the $2.3 million CD as a cash equivalent as of September 30, 2009, included a 
similar disclosure as the disclosure in the Form 10-K filed in January 2010:   

                                                 

                                               24

       In November 2009, the Company discovered that it did not receive the proceeds 
       from a bank for a $2,300,000 certificate of deposit that was scheduled to mature 
       in October 2009.  Although the Company made a formal inquiry of the bank, it 
       did not receive an adequate explanation for the bank’s non-performance related to 
       the deposit.  In December 2009, the Company entered into an agreement to assign 
       its interests in the certificate of deposit, without recourse, to an unrelated party 
       that has other business interests with the bank, and the Company was reimbursed 
       for the face value of the deposit. 
        
       82.    GEE’s Form 10-K filed on December 28, 2010, as amended on April 15, 2011, 
contained an audit report from BDO that stated BDO’s audits were conducted in accordance with 
PCAOB standards and that GEE’s financial statements presented fairly, in all material respects, 
the company’s position and results at September 30, 2010 and 2009, in conformity with GAAP.   
        
I.      VIOLATIONS 

                 RULE 102(e) AND SECTION 4C OF THE EXCHANGE ACT 

       83.    BDO’s 2009 and 2010 audits were deficient and not performed in accordance 
                        7
with PCAOB standards.       Section 4C(b) and Rule 102(e)(1)(iv) define improper professional 
conduct with respect to persons licensed to practice as accountants.  Pursuant to these prov isions, 
“improper professional conduct” includes two types of negligent conduct:  (1) a single instance 
of highly unreasonable conduct that results in a violation of professional standards in 
circumstances in which heightened scrutiny is warranted; or (2) repeated instances of 
unreasonable conduct, each resulting in violations of professional standards, that indicate a lack 
of competence.     
        
       84.    As set forth above, BDO knew or should have known facts that cast substantial 
doubt on the existence of the purported CD given, among other things, (1) significant integrity 
issues with Heineman, the person who claimed to have authorized the investment, and Associate-1, 
the person with whom Heineman purportedly “negotiated” the assignment agreement; (2) PAB had 
told GEE that it had no record of the purported CD; and (3) PAB had provided GEE and BDO with 
documentation showing the $2.3 million actually had been transferred to Park Avenue Insurance 
on July 23, 2009.   
        
       85.    BDO also knew or should have known that the circumstances presented by the 
purported $2.3 million CD that was not honored by PAB, the subsequent receipt by GEE of $2.3 
million from River Falls Financial, SDH, and Oxygen, and the purported assignment agreement 
with River Falls Investments warranted heightened scrutiny.  Notwithstanding the many red flags 
concerning the purported CD and the assignment agreement discussed above, BDO issued audit 
reports in both 2009 and 2010 containing unqualified opinions that were filed with GEE’s financial

  References to auditing standards in this Order  are to PCAOB s  tandards in effect at the time the 
audit work was performed.

statements in the Form 10-Ks.  In those reports, BDO inaccurately stated that the audit had been 
conducted in accordance with PCAOB standards and that GEE’s financial statements presented 
fairly, in all material respects, the company’s position and results in conformity with GAAP.   
 
               Failed to exercise due professional care and an attitude of professional 
               skepticism (AU § 230) 
                
       86.    PCAOB standards require auditors to exercise due professional care in the 
planning and performance of the audit and the preparation of the report.  (AU § 230.01)  
Auditors must maintain an attitude of professional skepticism, which includes “a questioning 
mind and a critical assessment of audit evidence.”  (AU § 230.07)  In addition, the auditor should 
“consider the competency and sufficiency of the evidence.  Since evidence is gathered and 
evaluated throughout the audit, professional skepticism should be exercised throughout the audit 
process.”  (AU § 230.08)  The Commission and courts have held that related party transactions 
                            8
require heightened scrutiny.     

       87.    As a result of BDO’s conduct described above, BDO failed to exercise due 
professional care and an attitude of professional skepticism in its 2009 and 2010 audits of GEE.   

               Failed to obtain sufficient competent evidential matter concerning the 
               purported CD (AU §§ 326 and 333) 

       88.    PCAOB standards require auditors to obtain sufficient competent evidential matter 
to afford a reasonable basis for an opinion with respect to the financial statements under audit.  To 
be “competent,” evidence “must be both valid and relevant.”  (AU § 326.21)  “The amount and 
kinds of evidential matter required to support an informed opinion are matters for the auditor to 
determine in the exercise of his or her professional judgment after a careful study of the 
circumstance in the particular case.”  (AU § 326.22)  This includes evaluating the reliability of the 
         9
evidence,  and weighing all of the evidence obtained.  The validity and sufficiency of required 
evidence depends on the circumstances and the auditors’ judgment, but should be “persuasive” 
though it need not be “convincing.”  (AU § 326.22)   
        
       89.    PCAOB standards also provide that management representations “are not a 
substitute for the application of th[e] auditing procedures necessary to afford a reasonable basis 
for an opinion regarding the financial statements under audit,” that “the auditor obtains written 
representations from management to complement other auditing procedures,” and that “[i]n

                                                                                           10
evidence because of a belief that management is honest.”  (AU §§ 333.02, 333.03, 230.09)         

       90.    As a result of BDO’s conduct described above, BDO failed to obtain sufficient 
evidence supporting assertions in GEE’s 2009 and 2010 Form 10-K financial statements that the 
purported CD existed and was a cash equivalent as of September 30, 2009, and that GEE entered 
                                                     11
into an assignment agreement with an unrelated party.    
                                                                     
               Failed to determine whether fraud or potential illegal acts may have impacted 
               GEE’s fiscal year 2009 and 2010 financial statements (AU §§ 316, 317) 

       91.    Under AU § 316.01, an auditor must plan and perform an audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, 
whether caused by error or fraud.  The auditors must brainstorm “how and where they believe 
the entity’s financial statements might be susceptible to material misstatement due to fraud, how 
management could perpetrate and conceal fraudulent financial reporting, and how assets of the 
entity could be misappropriated.”  (AU § 316.14)  AU § 316.06 states that there are “[t]wo types 
of misstatements relevant to the auditor’s consideration of fraud—misstatements arising from 
fraudulent financial reporting and misstatements arising from misappropriation of assets.”  It 
explains that financial reporting may be accomplished by falsification of supporting 
documentation, or misrepresentations of events, transactions, or other significant information.  It 
further instructs that fraudulent financial reporting “need not be the result of a grand plan or 
conspiracy” and may instead “be that management representatives rationalize the appropriateness 
of a material misstatement … as a temporary misstatement of financial statement … expected to 
be corrected later.”  It instructs that that misappropriation of assets may be accompanied by 
“false or misleading records or documents, possibly created by circumventing controls.”  AU § 
316.09 also notes that management engaged in fraud will take steps to conceal the fraud from 
auditors.  AU § 316.10 further states that fraud may be concealed through collusion among 
management and third parties.  For these reasons, AU § 316.13 requires auditors to exercise 
professional skepticism when considering the risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 

       92.    AU § 316.68 lists conditions that may be identified during the fieldwork that are 
indicators of potential fraud, including (i) unsupported or unauthorized balances or transactions; 
(ii) missing documents; (iii) unusual discrepancies between the entity’s records and confirmation 
replies; (iv) inconsistent, vague or implausible responses from management or employees; and 

                                                 
10
   AU § 508.20 also provided that “[c]ertain circumstances may require a qualified opinion … 
[when] “[t]here is a lack of sufficient competent evidential matter or there are restrictions on the 
scope of the audit that have led the auditor to conclude that he or she cannot express an 
unqualified opinion….”   
11
   In addition, AS   § 3.12   required BDO to “document significant audit findings or issues, actions 
taken to address them (including additional evidence obtained), and the basis for the conclusions 
reached.”  BDO failed to comply with this documentation requirement with respect to each of the 
major auditing issues encountered during the 2009 and 2010 audits.

(v) denial of access to records, facilities, certain employees, customers, vendors or others from 
whom audit evidence might be sought.   

       93.    AU § 317.10 notes that auditors may become aware of possible illegal acts during 
the course of their audit:  “When the auditor becomes aware of information concerning a 
possible illegal act, the auditor should obtain an understanding of the nature of the act, the 
circumstances in which it occurred and sufficient other information to evaluate the effect on the 
financial statements.”   

       94.    As a result of BDO’s conduct described above, BDO failed to adhere to these 
PCAOB standards during its 2009 or 2010 audits of GEE.   

               Failed to obtain sufficient audit evidence to determine whether the assignment 
               agreement was a related party transaction (AU §§ 326 and 334) 

       95.    PCAOB standards require that “[an] auditor should view related party transactions 
within the framework of existing [accounting] pronouncements, placing primary emphasis on the 
adequacy of disclosure.  In addition, the auditor should be aware that the substance of a 
particular transaction could be significantly different from its form and that the financial 
statements should recognize the substance of particular transactions rather than merely their legal 
form.”  (AU § 334.02)   

       96.    PCAOB standards require an auditor to obtain sufficient competent evidential 
matter to afford a reasonable basis for an opinion regarding the financial statements under audit. 
(AU § 326.01)  In selecting particular substantive tests to achieve the audit objectives, an auditor 
considers, among other things, the risk of material misstatement of the financial statements.  (AU § 
326.11)  With respect to related party transactions, PCAOB standards require that after an auditor 
identifies related party transactions, he or she should apply the procedures considered necessary to 
obtain satisfaction concerning their purpose, nature, and extent and their effect on the financial 
statements.  (AU § 334.09)  For each related party transaction for which disclosure is required, 
PCAOB standards require that the auditor satisfy himself that the transaction is adequately 
disclosed in the financial statements.  (AU § 334.11)   
        
       97.    The failure to disclose the assignment agreement as a related party transaction 
caused the financial statements to be misleading.  Financial Accounting Standards Board 
Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 850, Related Party Disclosures required that 
the following must be disclosed concerning related party transactions: (a) the nature of the 
relationship involved; (b) a description of the transaction; (c) the dollar amount of the transaction; 
and (d) amounts due from or to related parties and, if not otherwise apparent, the terms and manner 
of settlement.  Related party transactions cannot be presumed to have been conducted at arm’s-
length.  GAAP requires these disclosures so the reader can be alerted to their existence, so as to 
help the reader of the financial statements detect and explain possible differences in financial

                                                                                       12
statements of a company that engaged in related party transactions to those that did not.   Such 
disclosure helps the reader evaluate the substance of the related party transaction.  
 
       98.    As a result of BDO’s above-described conduct, BDO failed to exercise the 
requisite level of care, failed to perform sufficient procedures to identify related party 
transactions, failed to obtain sufficient audit evidence to determine whether the assignment 
agreement was a related party transaction during its 2009 or 2010 audits of GEE, and failed to 
follow up on evidence indicating that assertions regarding the purported CD and assignment 
agreement were unsubstantiated.  BDO also failed to ensure the issuance of an accurate audit 
report in 2009 and 2010, which misrepresented that GEE’s financial statements were presented 
fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with GAAP.   

               Failed to Investigate Newly Discovered Facts in 2010 (AU § 561) 

       99.    AU § 561.04 states that when an auditor becomes aware of information that he 
would have investigated if it had come to his attention during the course of the audit, he must 
determine if the information is reliable and whether the facts existed at the date of his report.  If the 
information is reliable and existed at the date of the report, the auditor must determine if his report 
would have been affected and people relying on the financial statements would find it important.  
(AU § 561.05.) 
        
       100.   As a result of BDO’s conduct described above, BDO failed to adhere to this 
PCAOB Standard after learning of, among other things, the Antonucci Complaint in March 2010 
and subsequent guilty plea in October 2010, as it concerned GEE’s 2009 financial statements.   

                                             Finding 
                                                  
       101.   As a result of the conduct described above, the Commission finds that BDO 
engaged in improper professional conduct within the meaning of Sections 4C(a)(2), 4C(b)(2)(A), 
and 4C(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 102(e)(1)(ii), 102(e)(1)(iv)(B)(1), and 
102(e)(1)(iv)(B)(2) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice.  BDO’s conduct in the 2009 and 2010 
audits of GEE involved repeated instances of unreasonable conduct, each resulting in violations of 
PCAOB standards and indicating a lack of competence, and also satisfies the standard of highly 
unreasonable conduct resulting in violations of PCAOB standards in circumstances in which 
heightened scrutiny was warranted.  
                                                  
                 BDO VIOLATED SECTION 10A OF THE EXCHANGE ACT 
        
       102.   Section 10A(a)(1) of the Exchange Act requires each audit conducted of an issuer 
by a registered public accounting firm to include “procedures designed to provide reasonable 
assurance of detecting illegal acts that would have a direct and material effect on the 
determination of financial statement amounts.”  Section 10A(a)(2) of the Exchange Act requires 

                                                 
12
   ASC    850 - 10 - 05 - 2 .  

                                                  

                                                29 
---------------------Page 30---------------------

each audit conducted of an issuer by a registered public accounting firm to include “procedures 
designed to identify related party transactions that are material to the financial statements or 
otherwise require disclosure therein.”  Section 10A(b)(1) requires a registered public accounting 
firm to, in accordance with PCAOB standards, “determine whether it is likely that an illegal act 
has occurred” if the firm “detects or otherwise becomes aware of information indicating that an 
illegal act (whether or not perceived to have a material effect on the financial statements of the 
issuer) has or may have occurred.”  No showing of scienter is necessary to establish a violation 
of Section 10A.  See SEC v. Solucorp Indus., Ltd., 197 F. Supp. 2d. 4, 10-11 (S.D.N.Y. 2002). 
        
       103.   In connection with the 2009 and 2010 GEE audits, BDO violated Section 
10A(a)(1) of the Exchange Act by failing to plan, design, and carry out audit procedures to 
provide reasonable assurance of detecting illegal acts that would have a direct and material effect 
on the determination of financial statements amounts. 
        
       104.   In connection with the 2009 and 2010 GEE audits, BDO violated Section 
10A(a)(2) of the Exchange Act by failing to plan, design, and carry out audit procedures to 
identify GEE’s material related party transactions that required disclosure in the financial 
statements.  
        
       105.   In connection with the 2009 and 2010 GEE audits, BDO violated Section 
10A(b)(1) of the Exchange Act by failing to determine whether it was likely that an illegal act 
had occurred after BDO was made aware of information indicating that an illegal act may have 
occurred. 
        
       106.   As a result of the conduct described above, the Commission finds that BDO 
violated Sections 10A(a)(1), (a)(2), and (b)(1) of the Exchange Act.   
        
               BDO WAS A CAUSE OF VIOLATIONS OF SECTION 13(a) OF  
                 THE EXCHANGE ACT AND RULE 13a-1 THEREUNDER 
        
       107.   Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13a-1 thereunder require that every 
issuer of a security registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act file with the 
Commission annual reports (i.e., Form 10-K) as the Commission may require, and mandate that 
periodic reports contain such further material information as may be necessary to make the 
required statements not misleading.  The obligation to file such reports embodies the requirement 
that they be true and correct. 
 
       108.   GEE’s annual reports on Form 10-K for fiscal years 2009 and 2010 included audit 
reports from BDO that stated BDO’s audits were conducted “in accordance with the standards of 
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)” and that GEE’s financial 
statements presented fairly, in all material respects, the company’s position and results.  These 
statements were materially misleading.  As a result of BDO’s above-described conduct, BDO’s 
2009 and 2010 audits were not conducted in accordance with PCAOB standards and the financial 
statements included in GEE’s 2009 and 2010 Form 10-Ks were materially misstated because, 
among other things, they incorrectly represented GEE had a $2.3 million CD and classified it as a 

                                                 

                                               30 
---------------------Page 31---------------------

cash equivalent as of September 30, 2009, and did not disclose the assignment agreement as a 
related party transaction, contrary to GAAP.  At a minimum, BDO knew or should have known 
that its unreasonable conduct would contribute to GEE’s filing of inaccurate 2009 and 2010 Form 
10-Ks.   
        
       109.   As a result of the conduct described above, the Commission finds that BDO was a 
cause of GEE’s violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13a-1 thereunder. 
        
J.      UNDERTAKINGS 
        
       110.   BDO’s Review.  Within one hundred and twenty days after the entry of this Order, 
BDO shall perform and complete a review and evaluation (“BDO’s Review”) of the sufficiency 
and adequacy of BDO’s quality controls set forth in its audit manual, including its policies and 
procedures set forth therein for audit and interim review procedures, regarding the following 
(hereinafter referred to as “BDO’s Policies”):  

       (i)     client acceptance and retention; 

       (ii)    the exercise of due professional care and professional skepticism (as set forth in AU 
               § 230);  

       (iii)    the identification and consideration of disclosures of related parties and related 
               party transactions (as set forth in Auditing Standard No. 18 and AU § 334);  

       (iv)    fraud detection (as set forth in AU § 316);  

       (v)     compliance with the requirements of AU § 317, including the identification of

               attributable to the entity whose financial statements are under audit or acts by 
               management or employees acting on behalf of the entity.  Illegal acts by clients do 
               not include personal misconduct by the entity’s personnel unrelated to their 
               business activities”; 

       (vi)    compliance with Section 10A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including 
               designing procedures to provide reasonable assurance of detecting illegal acts that 
               would have a direct and material effect on the determination of financial statement 
               amounts, and to comply with all requirements under the standards of the 
               Commission, the PCAOB, and Section 10A to evaluate and report suspected illegal 
               acts;  

       (vii)   obtaining sufficient appropriate audit evidence (as set forth in Auditing Standard 
               No. 15);  

       (viii)  evaluation of and reliance upon management representations (as set forth in AU § 
               333);  

                                                  

                                                31 
---------------------Page 32---------------------

       (ix)    third-party confirmations (as set forth in AU § 330), including evaluating the results 
               of the confirmation procedures in accordance with AU § 330.33, “In performing 
               that evaluation, the auditor should consider (a) the reliability of the confirmations 
               and alternative procedures; (b) the nature of any exceptions, including the 
               implications, both quantitative and qualitative, of those exceptions; (c) the evidence 
               provided by other procedures; and (d) whether additional evidence is needed.”  

       (x)    consultations with local, regional or national office technical oversight 
               professionals; 

       (xi)    adequate audit documentation, including work paper sign-off, archiving, and dating 
               (as set forth in Auditing Standard No. 3);  

       (xii)   document retention; and 

       (xiii)  the response to the discovery of new facts subsequent to the issuance of audit report 
               (as set forth in AU § 561).   

BDO’s Review shall assess the forgoing areas to determine whether BDO’s Policies are adequate 
and sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of compliance with all relevant Commission 
regulations and PCAOB standards and rules.   

       111.   BDO Report.  Within sixty days of completing the BDO Review, BDO shall deliver 
to the Commission staff a detailed written report (“BDO Report”) summarizing its review and 
changes to BDO’s Policies, if any, to provide reasonable assurance of compliance with all relevant 
Commission regulations and PCAOB standards and rules.  The BDO Report shall identify the 
undertaking, provide written evidence of compliance in the form of a narrative, and be supported 
by exhibits sufficient to demonstrate compliance.  The Commission staff may make reasonable 
requests for further evidence of compliance, and BDO agrees to provide such evidence. 

       112.   Independent Consultant’s Review.  BDO has undertaken to retain, within one 
hundred and eighty days after the entry of this Order, an independent consultant (“Independent 
Consultant”), not unacceptable to the Commission staff.  BDO shall provide to the Commission 
staff a copy of the engagement letter detailing the scope of the Independent Consultant’s 
responsibilities.  The Independent Consultant’s compensation and expenses shall be borne 
exclusively by BDO.  BDO shall deliver to the Independent Consultant the BDO Report at the 
same time as BDO provides such report to the Commission staff as specified in paragraph 111 
above.  BDO shall require that the Independent Consultant perform a review (the “IC Review”) of 
BDO’s Policies to determine whether BDO’s Policies are adequate and sufficient to provide 
reasonable assurance of compliance with all relevant Commission regulations and PCAOB 
standards and rules.  BDO shall cooperate fully with the Independent Consultant and shall provide 
reasonable access to firm personnel, information, and records as the Independent Consultant may 
reasonably request for the IC Review (including training materials pertaining to the undertaking in 
paragraph 116), subject to BDO’s right to withhold from disclosure any information or records 
protected by any applicable protection or privilege such as the attorney-client privilege or the 
attorney work product doctrine.   

                                                  

                                                32 
---------------------Page 33---------------------

       113.   Independent Consultant’s Report.  After the IC Review is completed, but no later 
than ninety days after receiving the BDO Report, the Independent Consultant shall issue a detailed 
written report (the “IC Report”) to BDO:  (a) summarizing the IC Review; and (b) making 
recommendations, where appropriate, reasonably designed to ensure that BDO’s Policies are 
adequate and sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of compliance with all relevant 
Commission regulations and PCAOB standards and rules.  BDO shall require the Independent 
Consultant to provide a copy of the IC Report to the Commission staff and the PCAOB staff when 
the IC Report is issued. 

       114.   BDO shall adopt, as soon as practicable, all recommendations of the Independent 
Consultant in the IC Report.  Provided, however, that within thirty days of issuance of the IC 
Report, BDO may advise the Independent Consultant in writing of any recommendation that it 
considers to be unnecessary, outside the scope of this Order, unduly burdensome, or impractical.  
BDO need not adopt any such recommendation at that time, but instead may propose in writing to 
the Independent Consultant and the Commission staff an alternative policy or procedure designed 
to achieve the same objective or purpose.  BDO and the Independent Consultant shall engage in 
good-faith negotiations in an effort to reach agreement on any recommendations objected to by 
BDO.  In the event that the Independent Consultant and BDO are unable to agree on an alternative 
proposal within sixty days, BDO shall abide by the determinations of the Independent Consultant.   

       115.   Certification by BDO’s CEO.  Within sixty days of issuance of the IC Report, but 
not sooner than thirty days after a copy of the IC Report is provided to the Commission staff, 
BDO’s chief executive officer (“CEO”) must certify to the Commission staff in writing that (i) 
BDO has adopted and has implemented or will implement all recommendations of the Independent 
Consultant, if any; and (ii) the Independent Consultant agrees with BDO’s adoption and 
implementation of the recommendations.  To the extent that BDO has not implemented all 
recommendations of the Independent Consultant within sixty days of issuance of the IC Report, 
BDO’s CEO must certify to the Commission staff in writing, thirty days after their 
implementation, that (i) BDO has adopted and has implemented all recommendations of the 
Independent Consultant; and (ii) the Independent Consultant agrees that the recommendations have 
been adequately adopted and implemented by BDO.  The certifications by BDO’s CEO shall 
identify the undertakings, provide written evidence of compliance in the form of a narrative, and be 
supported by exhibits sufficient to demonstrate compliance.  The Commission staff may make 
reasonable requests for further evidence of compliance, and BDO agrees to provide such evidence. 

       116.   Undertakings Regarding Audit Training.  Prior to September 30, 2016, BDO shall 
require each audit professional serving public company audits to complete successfully: 

           a.  A Minimum of 24 Hours of Audit-Related Training. The audit-related training 
               requirement shall cover the topics specified in paragraph 110(i)-(xiii).  A minimum 
               of four hours must be allocated to each of these two topics:  (i) potential illegal acts 
               and Section 10A of the Exchange Act, and (ii) identification and disclosure of 
               related party transactions.  The audit-related training requirement may be fulfilled 
               by completing course(s) conducted in accordance with the applicable state boards 
               of accountancy. 
                

                                                 

                                                33 
---------------------Page 34---------------------

           b.  A Minimum of 8 Hours of Fraud-Detection Training. BDO shall ensure that audit 
               professionals assigned to public company engagements undergo fraud detection 
               training.  The training shall include techniques in detecting and responding to 
               possible fraud in the course of public company audits by audit clients or by 
               employees, officers or directors of audit clients. 
        
       117.   To ensure the independence of the Independent Consultant, BDO: (1) shall not have 
the authority to terminate the Independent Consultant or substitute another independent compliance 
consultant for the initial Independent Consultant, without the prior written approval of the 
Commission staff; and (2) shall compensate the Independent Consultant and persons engaged to 
assist the Independent Consultant for services rendered pursuant to this Order at their reasonable 
and customary rates. 

       118.   BDO shall require the Independent Consultant to enter into an agreement that 
provides that, for the period of engagement and for a period of two years from completion of the 
engagement, the Independent Consultant shall not enter into any employment, consultant, attorney-
client, auditing or other professional relationship with BDO, or any of its present or former 
affiliates, directors, officers, employees, or agents acting in their capacity as such.  The agreement 
shall also provide that the Independent Consultant will require that any firm with which he/she is 
affiliated or of which he/she is a member, and any person engaged to assist the Independent 
Consultant in performance of his/her duties under this Order shall not, without prior written 
consent of the Division of Enforcement, enter into any employment, consultant, attorney-client, 
auditing or other professional relationship with BDO, or any of its present or former affiliates, 
directors, officers, employees, or agents acting in their capacity as such for the period of the 
engagement and for a period of two years after the engagement. 

       119.   BDO shall not be in, and shall not have an attorney-client relationship with the 
Independent Consultant and shall not seek to invoke the attorney-client privilege or any other 
doctrine or privilege to prevent the Independent Consultant from transmitting any information, 
reports, or documents to Commission staff. 

       120.   BDO shall inform its audit professionals of the terms of the Order within ten 
business days after entry of the Order. 

       121.   By December 31, 2016, BDO’s CEO shall certify, in writing, compliance with the 
undertakings set forth in paragraphs 116 and 120.  The certification shall identify the undertakings, 
provide written evidence of compliance in the form of a narrative, and be supported by exhibits 
sufficient to demonstrate compliance.  The Commission staff may make reasonable requests for 
further evidence of compliance, and BDO agrees to provide such evidence.   

       122.   Annual Certifications.  With respect to each of the calendar year periods 2017 and 
2018, BDO’s chief compliance officer (“CCO”) shall certify that BDO has assessed whether 
BDO’s Policies are adequate and sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of compliance with all 
relevant Commission regulations and PCAOB standards and rules by, among other things, testing 
the firm’s implementation of BDO’s Policies during the twelve (12) months preceding the 
certification (“Annual Certification”).  The Annual Certification shall describe the nature and 

                                                  

                                                34 
---------------------Page 35---------------------

scope of BDO’s testing.  The Annual Certification shall represent that the CCO has reviewed and 
evaluated the firm’s assessment and testing process and that, based on belief and after reasonable 
inquiry, the CCO believes that BDO’s Policies are adequate and sufficient to provide reasonable 
assurance of compliance with all relevant Commission regulations and PCAOB standards and 
rules.  If the CCO cannot represent that BDO’s Policies are adequate and sufficient, then the CCO 
shall describe in reasonable detail the reasons for the inability to so certify.  The CCO shall provide 
the Annual Certifications to the Commission’s staff within sixty days of the end of the annual 
period.  BDO shall preserve and retain all documentation regarding the CCO’s Annual 
Certification for seven (7) years and will make it available to the staffs of the Commission or the 
PCAOB upon request. 

       123.   All reports and certifications mentioned in these undertakings shall be submitted to 
Wendy Tepperman, Assistant Regional Director, Division of Enforcement, Securities and 
Exchange Commission, 200 Vesey Street, New York, NY 10281, with a copy to the Office of 
Chief Counsel of the Enforcement Division. 

       124.   For good cause shown, the Commission staff may extend any of the procedural 
dates relating to the undertakings.  Deadlines for procedural dates shall be counted in calendar 
days, except that if the last day falls on a weekend or federal holiday, the next business day shall be 
considered to be the last day. 

       125.   In determining whether to accept BDO’s Offer, the Commission has considered 
these undertakings.  BDO agrees that if the Division of Enforcement believes that BDO has not 
satisfied these undertakings, it may petition the Commission to reopen the matter to determine 
whether additional sanctions are appropriate. 

                                               IV. 
 
       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest 
to impose the sanctions agreed to in the Respondent’s Offer. 
 
       Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that: 
 
       A.     Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, BDO shall cease and desist from 
committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 10A and 13(a) of the 
Exchange Act and Rule 13a-1 thereunder. 
        
       B.     BDO is censured. 
        
       C.     BDO shall comply with the undertakings enumerated in Section III.J. above. 
        
       D.     BDO shall within 14 days of the entry of this Order, pay disgorgement of 
$536,000 and prejudgment interest of $76,000, to the Commission for transfer to the general 
fund of the United States Treasury in accordance with Exchange Act Section 21F(g)(3).  If
