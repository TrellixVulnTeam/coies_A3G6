      The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate that cease-
and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities

                                                 III. 
 
                                                                                  1
        On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds  that:  
 
                                             Summary  

       1.      These proceedings arise from violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 
1977 (the “FCPA”) [15 U.S.C. 78dd] by Respondent Walid Hatoum concerning offers of 
payment and other benefits to foreign officials in Qatar in connection with the award of 
government contracts to PBS&J International, Inc. (“PBSJ&J Int’l”), a wholly-owned subsidiary 
of PBSJ Corporation (“PBSJ”).   
        
                                            Respondent 
 
       2.      Walid Hatoum (“Hatoum”), age 55, is a United States citizen who initially 
worked for PBSJ as an engineer from 1986 until 1990.  In February 2009, Hatoum was rehired to 
join PBS&J Int’l as its Director of International Marketing, even though his prior employment 
file at PBSJ had been marked “Ineligible for Rehire.” Although Hatoum did not formally join 
PBS&J Int’l until April 2009, he assisted PBS&J Int’l with identifying projects as early as 
November 2008.  Hatoum was promoted to President of PBS&J Int’l in mid-June 2009, and 
became an officer of PBSJ at the same time.   

                                         Relevant Entities 

                                                   
       3.      The PBSJ Corporation (“PBSJ”) was an employee-owned engineering and 
construction firm incorporated in Florida and headquartered in Tampa.  Through the relevant 
period, PBSJ’s common stock was registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and PBSJ filed annual and quarterly reports as required 
                                                                 2
under Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules thereunder.         

       4.      PBS&J International, Inc. (“PBS&J Int’l”) was a wholly-owned subsidiary of 
PBSJ headquartered and incorporated in Florida.  PBS&J Int’l was a provider of engineering, 

                                                 
1
       The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent's Offer of Settlement and are not  
binding on any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.   
 
2
        On October 1, 2010, after the conduct at issue, WS Atkins plc (“Atkins”), a public limited engineering and 
design company based in the United Kingdom and organized under the laws of England and Wales, acquired PBSJ 
and all of its common stock.  Atkins is traded on the London Stock Exchange under the symbol ATK.L.  That day, 
PBSJ filed a Form 15 with the Commission, which terminated all offerings of its securities and removed all 
remaining securities from registration under Section 12(g).  Post-acquisition, PBSJ became an indirect wholly-
owned subsidiary of Atkins.  On April 1, 2011, PBSJ changed its name to The Atkins North America Holdings 
Corporation.

architectural and planning services in international markets, including the Middle East.  PBS&J 
Int’l currently is a subsidiary of Atkins. 

                                             Facts 
        
       5.     During 2009, PBS&J Int’l won two multi-million dollar development contracts.  
One contract was for work in Qatar and the other was for work in Morocco.  Both were 
competitively solicited and approved by the Qatari Diar Real Estate Investment Company 
(“Qatari Diar”).  Qatari Diar was established by the Qatari government to coordinate the 
country’s real estate development.   

       6.     PBSJ and PBS&J Int’l, through  Hatoum, offered bribes to the then-Director of 
International Projects at Qatari Diar (“Foreign Official”), to secure Qatari government contracts 
by planning to funnel funds to a local company the Foreign Official owned and controlled 
(“Local Partner”).  Foreign Official, a former business colleague of Hatoum’s at another U.S. 
engineering firm, worked for Qatari Diar throughout 2009, until his resignation from Qatari Diar 
on December 21, 2009.  Prior to joining PBSJ, Hatoum and Foreign Official discussed directing 
business in the Middle East to Local Partner.    

       7.     In return, Foreign Official provided PBS&J Int’l with access to confidential 
sealed-bid information and pricing information on the two government contracts that helped 
PBS&J Int’l tender bids that had a greater likelihood of being awarded, including a government 
contract for which the Foreign Official was the project manager.  

                        Offers and Promises Made to Foreign Official 
                                                 
                                     LRT Project in Qatar 
                                                 
       8.     In November and December 2008, Hatoum began discussing potential 
employment with PBSJ.  Even before he received a formal employment contract, Hatoum met 
with PBS&J Int’l to discuss opportunities to grow PBS&J Int’l business in the Middle East.  
Hatoum discussed projects involving Qatari Diar, including a light rail transit project in Qatar 
(“the LRT Project”).   

       9.     In January 2009, Hatoum arranged for Foreign Official’s brother, through Local 
Partner, to introduce PBS&J Int’l to Qatari Diar senior executives involved in the LRT Project.  
Soon after that meeting, PBS&J Int’l decided to bid on the LRT Project.  PBS&J Int’l added 
Foreign Official’s company, Local Partner, on its proposal team as a subcontractor to handle 
local operations such as hiring local labor, as well as complying with bonding and insurance 
requirements.  In return, Hatoum and PBS&J Int’l agreed to pay the Foreign Official, through 
Local Partner, 40% of profits realized from any LRT Project contract as well as reimburse its 
direct costs.  The remaining profits were to be split between PBS&J Int’l (40%) and another 
U.S.-based subcontractor (20%), which would perform all of the planning and engineering 
services for the LRT project.   

                                               3  
---------------------Page 4---------------------

 
                                                                                                 
       10.    At that time, Hatoum was the only person at PBS&J Int’l who had any knowledge 
about Foreign Official’s ownership interest in Local Partner.  Had PBSJ conducted meaningful 
due diligence at that time, it would have discovered the Foreign Official’s dual role as both 
government official and third-party owner/operator of Local Partner.   

       11.    During the bidding process, Foreign Official gave confidential sealed bid 
information to PBS&J Int’l to assist it in winning the LRT Project in return for promised 
payments.  Foreign Official also made strategic and technical decisions on many aspects of the 
LRT Project that favored PBS&J Int’l with Hatoum’s knowledge. 

       12.    Foreign Official used a Local Partner alias to communicate that information to 
Hatoum and other PBSJ and PBS&J Int’l employees while disguising his involvement on 
multiple conference calls and in dozens of emails to the United States.  Hatoum was aware that 
Foreign Official was using the alias in communications with PBSJ employees, officers, and 
directors and with Qatari Diar.  Hatoum flew to the Middle East to meet with Qatari Diar 
officials, including Foreign Official, to discuss PBS&J Int’l’s qualifications for the LRT Project.  
At the meeting, neither Foreign Official nor Hatoum informed Qatari Diar that Foreign Official 
was working for Local Partner and providing confidential information and other assistance to 
help PBS&J Int’l win the contracts. 

       13.    Following its initial submission, PBS&J Int’l revised its bid, based on information 
and guidance provided by the Foreign Official, to best position itself to win the LRT Project and 
to withstand possible challenges from competitors.  On or about August 3, 2009, Qatari Diar 
awarded the LRT Project contract worth approximately $35.6 million to PBS&J Int’l.   

       14.    After the award, PBS&J Int’l opened a joint account with Local Partner that was 
accessible to Foreign Official’s wife.  PBS&J Int’l  also authorized a four-year letter of credit 
relating to a bank guarantee in Qatar.  The letter of credit was a precondition for receipt of the 
first contract payment by Qatari Diar to PBS&J Int’l, an upfront, 10% (approximately $3.6 
million) payment, which was deposited into the joint account.  

       15.    Once the award was received, Hatoum offered Foreign Official an “agency fee” to 
Local Partner for 1.8% of the LRT Project contract amount (equivalent to approximately 
$640,000).  Additionally, PBS&J Int’l agreed to pay half of the salary of Foreign Official’s wife, 
who worked for Local Partner.   

                                  Design Contract in Morocco 
                                                 
       16.    In addition to the LRT Project, Qatari Diar opened a Morocco hotel resort 
development (“Morocco Project”) for competitive bid.  On August 7, 2009, PBS&J Int’l emailed 
its Statement of Qualifications for the design contract to Foreign Official, the Qatari Diar project 
manager for the Morocco Project.  

       17.    In October 2009, Hatoum offered payment to Foreign Official in the form of an 
agency fee to Local Partner to secure the Morocco Project.  The Morocco Project was worth 

                                               4  
---------------------Page 5---------------------

 
                                                                                                
approximately $25 million to PBSJ Int’l, of which the Foreign Official was offered an agency fee 
of 3% of the contract amount, which equates to approximately $750,000.  Hatoum instructed a 
PBS&J Int’l employee to hide the agency fee within the company’s bid proposal by inflating 
other components of the offer for the Morocco Project.   

       18.    Foreign Official attended meetings with PBS&J Int’l employees to discuss the 
project but neither Foreign Official nor Hatoum told employees that he was working for Local 
Partner.  At the same time, Foreign Official, using his Local Partner alias, reviewed and made 
changes to PBS&J Int’l’s original bid offer via email and phone.  He also made key technical and 
strategic proposal decisions throughout the bidding process and instructed PBS&J Int’l to lower 
its offer to a specific dollar amount.  By doing so, he ensured PBS&J Int’l’s final bid had a 
greater likelihood of being approved by Qatari Diar.  On or around October 19, 2009, Qatari Diar 
informed PBS&J Int’l that it was awarded the Morocco Project.   

                                          Red Flags 
                                                
       19.    PBSJ and PBS&J Int’l officers and employees ignored multiple red flags that 
should have led them to uncover the payment scheme.  For example, PBS&J Int’l and PBSJ 
employees knew that Local Partner was providing them with confidential sealed bid information.  
Hatoum also informed the employees that he was obtaining information from someone that 
Hatoum described as a “good friend” and “top executive” at Qatari Diar.  Before PBS&J Int’l 
submitted its bid for the Morocco Project, a PBS&J Int’l officer learned that the husband of one 
of the Local Partner employees was a government official working on the Morocco Project.  The 
PBS&J Int’l officer learned of Foreign Official’s role while attending dinner with Hatoum, 
Foreign Official and the Foreign Official’s wife.  In addition, a PBSJ employee knew that 
“agency fees” to Local Partner were disguised as legitimate costs within the Morocco Project 
bid.   
  
                              Discovery of the Payment Scheme 
 
       20.    Shortly after PBS&J Int’l was awarded the Morocco Project contract, PBSJ’s 
former Chief Operating Officer commented to PBSJ’s then-general counsel that PBS&J Int’l was 
successful in winning two contracts in the Middle East within a fairly short period of time.  
PBSJ’s then-general counsel asked Hatoum how he was able to win the LRT and Morocco 
Project contracts over companies with far more international experience.  Hatoum told PBSJ’s 
then-general counsel PBSJ offered “agency fees” in order to win the projects and, when asked, 
admitted there “would be a problem” if the agency fees were not paid.  PBSJ’s then-general 
counsel immediately launched an investigation of this issue.   

       21.    Three weeks later, in November 2009, a Qatari government official informed 
Hatoum and the then-President of PBSJ that Qatari Diar had discovered Foreign Official’s 
involvement in Local Partner and was rescinding PBS&J Int’l’s contract for the Morocco 
Project.  Hatoum then secretly made an offer of employment to a second Qatari foreign official 
in return for influencing Qatari Diar to reinstate the contract.  However, Qatari Diar refused to 

                                               5  
---------------------Page 6---------------------

 
                                                                                                
reinstate the contract and did not provide PBS&J Int’l any proceeds for the project.  PBSJ 
suspended Hatoum in December 2009.  Hatoum also began deleting emails and other records. 

       22.    PBS&J Int’l and Qatari Diar negotiated a termination of the LRT Project contract 
effective December 31, 2009.  In January 2010, Qatari Diar entered into a bridge contract with 
PBS&J Int’l to continue work on the LRT Project (the “Bridge Contract”) until a replacement 
company could be found.  Ultimately, the period of performance on the Bridge Contract was 16 
½ months.  PBS&J Int’l earned $2,892,504 in profits on the Bridge Contract.  PBSJ and Qatari 
Diar caught Hatoum’s scheme before any of the offered and authorized amounts were paid. 

                  Hatoum Caused PBSJ’s Inaccurate Books and Records 
 
       23.    Hatoum authorized illicit payments to Foreign Official that were not accurately 
and fairly reflected on PBSJ’s books and records.  Hatoum directed subordinates to conceal some 
of the payments he offered and authorized to Foreign Official within bids.  Other offers and 
promises to pay authorized by Hatoum to Foreign Official were improperly described in the 
books and records as legitimate transaction costs with his knowledge.   
        
               Hatoum Caused PBSJ’s Internal Accounting Control Failure 
                                             
       24.    On April 22, 2009, Hatoum signed a “Business Conduct Standards” agreement for 
PBSJ employees in which he agreed that “I will neither accept nor give bribes or kickbacks of 
any value for services or favorable treatment for contracts.”  As a high level manager at PBS&J 
Int’l and later as an officer of PBSJ, Hatoum was responsible for maintaining and ensuring 
compliance with PBSJ’s internal accounting controls at PBS&J Int’l.  Hatoum, however, 
repeatedly exploited the company’s internal accounting control deficiencies to offer and 
authorize payments to Foreign Official through Local Partner totaling approximately $1,390,000 
to secure the LRT and Morocco Projects, plus 40% of any profits realized from the LRT Project 
and partial salary to Foreign Official’s wife.  Hatoum instructed subordinates to inflate PBS&J 
Int’l bids by concealing payments to Local Partner intended for Foreign Official.  Hatoum took 
advantage of PBSJ’s accounting controls system by introducing Local Partner as a “legitimate” 
potential partner for the LRT Project and authorized a subordinate to execute an agreement to 
pay Local Partner 40% of the LRT Project profits without subjecting Local Partner or its 
employees to any meaningful due diligence.  Hatoum also knowingly executed - and caused a 
PBS&J Int’l employee to send a questionnaire requesting advocacy assistance from the United 
States Department of Commerce that included false representations about Local Partner and 
PBS&J Int’l.  Although Hatoum did not participate in PBSJ’s FCPA training until after the 
scheme was uncovered, Hatoum was aware of the prohibitions of the FCPA from annual FCPA 
training that he received from his former employer.    
        
                               Legal Standards and Violations 

       25.    Under Section 21C(a) of the Exchange Act, the Commission may impose a cease-
and-desist order upon any person who is violating, has violated, or is about to violate any 

                                              6

provision of the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder, and upon any other person 
that is, was, or would be a cause of the violation, due to an act or omission the person knew or 
should have known would contribute to such violation. 

                                        FCPA Violations 
        
       26.     As a result of the conduct described above, Hatoum violated Section 30A of the 
Exchange Act, which prohibits any issuer, officer, director, employee, or agent of such issuer or 
any stockholder thereof acting on behalf of the issuer, to make use of the mails or any means or 
instrumentality of interstate commerce corruptly in furtherance of an offer, payment, promise to 
pay, or authorization of the payment of any money, or offer, gift, promise to give, or 
authorization of the giving of anything of value to any foreign official or any person, while 
knowing that all or a portion of such money or thing of value will be offered, given, or promised, 
directly or indirectly, to any foreign official for the purposes of (i) influencing any act or 
decision of such foreign official in his official capacity, (ii) inducing such foreign official to do 
or omit to do any act in violation of the lawful duty of such official, or (iii) securing any 
improper advantage in order to assist such issuer in obtaining or retaining business for or with, or 
directing business to, any person. 
       .        
       27.     As a result of the conduct described above, Hatoum caused violations of Section 
13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act by PBSJ, which requires reporting companies to make and keep 
books, records, and accounts which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect their 
transactions and dispositions of their assets.  
        
       28.     Lastly, as a result of the conduct described above, Hatoum caused violations of 
Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act by PBSJ, and violated Section 13(b)(5) and Rule 13b2-
1 thereunder, which requires all reporting companies to devise and maintain a system of internal 
accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as 
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles; and prohibit persons from knowingly circumventing or knowingly failing 
to implement a system of internal accounting controls, knowingly falsifying any book, record or 
account, and directly or indirectly falsifying or causing to be falsified any book, record, or 
account.
