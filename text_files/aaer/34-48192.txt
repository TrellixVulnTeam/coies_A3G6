Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that a cease-and-desist proceeding

this proceeding, Respondents consent to the issuance of this Order
Instituting Public Cease-and-Desist Proceeding, Making Findings and
Issuing a Cease-and-Desist Order ("Order").
III.
On the basis of this Order and the Offers, the Commission makes the
following findings2:
A. Respondents
Arsin Corporation is a software company primarily involved in providing
consulting services. Based in Santa Clara, California, Arsin is a private
corporation incorporated under California law. Arsin's stock is held by
its CEO and Chairman, Danis Yadegar-Mooshiabadi, two outside investors,
and by twenty-five current or former employees.
Danis Yadegar-Mooshiabadi, age 47, resides in Campbell, California and
is the President, Chairman, and CEO of Arsin.
B. Summary
In December 2000, Unify Corporation ("Unify") restated its previously
announced financial results for all four quarters of its fiscal year 2000,
which ended on April 30, 2000. A portion of Unify's restatement was to
correct two "roundtrip" sales transactions involving Arsin that occurred
at the end of Unify's third and fourth quarters of its fiscal year 2000.
As part of Unify's restatement for the third quarter, Unify reversed
$450,000 in previously recognized revenue relating to Arsin's purchase of
a software license from Unify. This transaction caused Unify's originally
reported revenue for the quarter to be overstated by 8.6%. As part of
Unify's restatement of the fourth quarter, Unify reversed $500,000 in
previously announced revenue relating to a fee that Arsin agreed to pay
Unify in connection with an original equipment manufacturer's agreement.
The second transaction caused Unify's originally reported revenue for the
quarter to be overstated by 10.9 % in Unify's fiscal year 2000 earnings
announcement.
When it entered into these contracts with Unify, Arsin lacked the funds
to pay for the software it was licensing from Unify and Arsin later used
funds that it received from Unify to pay for Unify's software. In each
instance, Arsin and Yadegar provided Unify with a check that Arsin lacked
the funds to cover, with the understanding that Unify would show the check
to Unify's independent auditor and that Unify would not deposit Arsin's
check until Unify had provided Arsin with the funds necessary to cover
Arsin's check.
C. Prior Dealings Between Arsin and Unify
In October 1999, Yadegar recruited Reza Mikailli, Unify's CEO, as the
first outside member of Arsin's board of directors. Yadegar had known
Mikailli for more than 12 years, since the two worked together at another
high technology company. At the same time, in October 1999, Unify hired
Arsin to carry out performance testing for a new software product Unify
was planning to develop, called eWave. According to the terms of a
so-called Funded Development Agreement dated October 20, 1999, Unify
agreed to pay Arsin $125,000 to develop a testing protocol, test the
product, and provide Unify with the test results. The contract provided
that Arsin and Unify would jointly own both the testing protocol and the
test results. Arsin completed its work under the contract in December
1999.
D. The January 2000 Roundtrip Transaction
On January 24, 2000, Unify and Arsin entered into a software license
that gave Arsin the right to have an unlimited number of its employees use
Unify's eWave product, in exchange for $500,000. Unify recognized this
entire amount as revenue in the Form 10-Q that Unify filed for the quarter
ended January 31, 2000. Unify later determined that $450,000 of this
revenue was improperly recognized because it was offset by a reciprocal
agreement in which Unify supplied Arsin with funds to pay for the software
license.
Yadegar and Mikailli negotiated the license agreement, along with
Unify's CFO, Gary Pado. Yadegar initially informed Mikailli and Pado that
Arsin did not have the funds to cover payment. Mikailli told Yadegar that
the license agreement would not cost Arsin anything but that he needed an
agreement in the amount of $500,000 and required a check by the end of
January 2000. Mikailli informed Yadegar that Unify wanted to close the
transaction by the end of January because Unify required the $500,000 for
its revenue for the quarter ended January 31, 2000. Mikailli and Pado also
told Yadegar that Unify required the check in order to show it to their
auditors in the first week of the following month. Yadegar gave Unify a
check for the full amount after reaching an agreement with Mikailli and
Pado that Unify would not cash the check until Yadegar informed them that
he had the money to cover the check.
In order to provide Arsin with the funds to pay for the license
agreement, Yadegar and Pado simultaneously negotiated an amendment to the
prior Funded Development Agreement between Arsin and Unify. Under the
amended Funded Development Agreement, Arsin agreed to provide a revised
testing protocol for eWave, run additional tests, and give Unify sole
ownership of both the testing protocol and results, in exchange for an
additional $450,000. The amended Funded Development Agreement was a sham
agreement. No technical work was done under the agreement, and its purpose
was to provide Arsin with the funds it needed to pay for the software
license.
E. The April 2000 Roundtrip Transaction
On April 29, 2000, Unify and Arsin entered into an original equipment
manufacturer ("OEM") agreement, in which Arsin agreed to pay $500,000 for
the right to incorporate Unify's eWave product into software that Arsin
had not yet developed. Unify recognized this entire amount as revenue in
its earnings release for the fourth quarter ended April 30, 2000. Unify
later determined that all of this revenue was improperly recognized
because Unify supplied Arsin with the funds it needed to pay for the OEM
agreement just two weeks after the agreement was signed.
Mikailli and Pado called Yadegar in April 2000 and requested that Arsin
do another $500,000 deal with Unify. Yadegar again informed them that
Arsin lacked the funds to cover a $500,000 payment. Mikailli told Yadegar
that Arsin ultimately would not have to pay for the agreement, but that
Unify required a check from Arsin by the end of April. Mikailli and Pado
told Yadegar that Unify wanted the contract to include it in Unify's
quarterly revenue and required the check by the end of April so that they
could present it to Unify's auditors. Yadegar executed the OEM contract on
April 29, and provided Unify with a check for the entire $500,000 on the
same day. Yadegar, Mikailli and Pado agreed that Unify would refrain from
depositing the check until Arsin received funds from Unify to cover
it.
Despite this agreement, in early May 2000 Unify deposited Arsin's
check, which bounced due to insufficient funds. Upon learning of the
bounced check, Yadegar threatened to cancel the OEM agreement with Unify.
On May 12, 2000, Unify wired Arsin $500,000 to cover the bounced Arsin
check. Arsin used the funds from the wire transfer to pay Unify.
F. Legal Conclusions
As described in Parts III.A through III.E above, from January 2000
through the end of May 2000, Arsin and Yadegar engaged in misconduct
intended to assist Unify in fraudulently boosting its financial results.
As a result, Unify's financial statements for the periods ended January
31, 2000 and April 30, 2000 (which were filed with the Commission, or
otherwise disseminated to investors) were materially false and
misleading.
Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that Arsin and Yadegar
caused Unify's violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the
Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder, and caused certain
former officers of Unify's violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of
the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2, thereunder.
IV.
Based on the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to accept
the Offers submitted by Arsin and Yadegar. Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY
ORDERED pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act that:By the
Commission.
