       On the basis of this Order and Respondents’ Offers, the Commission finds     3
                                                                                     that:  
 
                                             Summary  
 
       These proceedings arise out of LSB’s and Jones’ failures to comply with Generally 
Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) in connection with LSB’s change in inventory pricing 
methodology from LIFO to FIFO.  When LSB changed from LIFO to FIFO during the first quarter 
of fiscal year 2004, the value of its LIFO reserve was material to its net income.4
                                                                                    LSB, however, 
failed to comply with GAAP by disclosing its change from LIFO to FIFO and by restating its prior 
financial results.  Instead, to avoid a restatement, Jones (LSB’s then Chief Accounting Officer and 
Controller) directed his subordinates to eliminate the LIFO reserve by improperly “bleeding it 
down” over four quarters in 2004.  Consequently, Jones caused LSB to issue three quarterly reports 
and one annual report for fiscal  year 2004 that failed to comply with GAAP.  In addition, Jones 
caused two of the quarterly reports issued in fiscal year 2004 to falsely represent that LSB still 
maintained LIFO inventory.  In December 2005, after the Commission’s Division of Corporation 
Finance questioned how LSB’s change from LIFO to FIFO was in compliance with GAAP, LSB 
disclosed the change and restated its financial results.     
        
        
        

                                                 
3 
 The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondents’ offers of settlement and are not binding on any                 
other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

 LIFO is an inventory pricing method whereby a company values the cost of the products it sells at the price paid   
for its most recently purchased inventory.  Under FIFO, a company values the cost of the products it sells at the    
price paid for its oldest purchased inventory.  GAAP requires  issuers with LIFO inventory to maintain a reserve that  
represents the difference between the carrying value of their inventory using LIFO and  what the carrying value of 
that inventory would be if they used FIFO instead.  GAAP requires companies to track their inventory costs in order  
to maintain a LIFO reserve.

                                        Respondents  
 
       1.      LSB Industries, Inc. is a Delaware corporation, based in Oklahoma City, 
Oklahoma.  It is a diversified holding company with two primary subsidiaries.  Its Climate Control 
Business manufactures and sells products used  in commercial and residential air conditioning 
systems.  LSB’s Chemical Business manufactures and sells chemical pr   oducts for agricultural, 
varied industrial, and mining markets.  LSB’s securities are registered with the Commission 
pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and are listed on the New York Stock Exchange.   
        
       2. Jimmie Dean Jones, age 66, is a Certified Public A     ccountant licensed to practice in 
Oklahoma.  Jones served as the Chief Accounting Officer, Corporate Controller, Treasurer and a   
Senior Vice President of LSB, from the early 1980s until he resigned from these positions in 2008.  
He is currently a Senior Vice President and Treasurer at LSB.  Prior to joining LSB, Jones worked  
in public accounting for seven years at Arthur Young & Co. 
   
                                              Facts  
 
       1.      Prior to and during its fiscal year 2003, LSB valued the inventory of its Climate 
Master subsidiary using the LIFO (last in, first out) inventory pricing method.  LSB also tracked its 
inventory costs to maintain a LIFO reserve which, under GAAP, is required to reflect the 
difference between the carrying value of a company’s inventory under LIFO and what the carrying 
value would be if the company instead used the FIFO (first in, first out) inventory pricing method.  
        
       2.      In May 2003, LSB’s independent auditor, Ernst & Young (“E&Y”), suggested to 
LSB that it change the inventory pricing method for its Climate Master subsidiary from LIFO to 
FIFO for tax purposes.  E&Y suggested this change because LSB was no longer deriving any tax 
benefit from maintaining this pricing methodology, yet was incurring the cost of tracking its LIFO 
inventory as required by GAAP.  LSB agreed and, at Jones’ direction, changed from LIFO to FIFO 
for tax purposes in October 2003.  
        
       3.      For financial reporting purposes, however, LSB did not change  from LIFO to FIFO 
at that time to avoid having to restate its financial results.  Under GAAP, if the value of an issuer’s 
LIFO reserve is material to its net income when it changes from LIFO to FIFO, then the issuer 
must disclose the change and eliminate its LIFO reserve by restating its financial statements to 
reflect what the company’s results would have been in prior periods had it not maintained a LIFO 
reserve.5
          Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20, “Accounting Changes” (“APB 20”).  At  
the end of fiscal year 2003, LSB’s LIFO reserve was $503,000, which represented 16 percent of its  
2003 reported net income of $3,111,000.  However, the LIFO reserve was forecast to decline to 
$250,000 by  the end of fiscal year 2004 in the ordinary course of business.  In December 2003, an  
E&Y senior manager advised Jones that if LSB were to delay the change from LIFO to FIFO for  
financial reporting purposes until its LIFO reserve became immaterial, the company could write 
the reserve off without having to restate.     
                                                 
5 
 Alternatively, if an issuer’s LIFO reserve is not material to its net income in the period of the change, an issuer       
changing from LIFO to FIFO may eliminate its LIFO reserve by releasing the value of the reserve into current net 
income and disclosing the change in the notes to its financial statements.   
                                                  
                                                3 

---------------------Page 4---------------------

        
       4.     To avoid filing a restatement, Jones told an E&Y audit principal on January 5, 
2004, that LSB would delay the change from LIFO to FIFO for financial reporting purposes until 
the end of 2004 to ensure that E&Y would not consider the impact of the change on LSB’s net 
income to be material.  The E&Y audit principal agreed with this plan and confirmed to Jones that 
he would not consider a restatement to be necessary if LSB were to change from LIFO to FIFO 
when the LIFO reserve fell to $250,000, assuming that LSB’s financial condition did not change 
materially. 
        
       5.     LSB ceased tracking inventory costs in January 2004.  By not tracking its LIFO 
inventory costs, which GAAP requires for purposes  of maintaining an accurate LIFO reserve, LSB 
effectively switched to FIFO for financial reporting purposes in January 2004.  LSB did not  
disclose its change from LIFO to FIFO for financial reporting purposes at that time.  Jones 
understood in the first quarter of fiscal year 2004 that LSB had ceased tracking inventory costs.   
Jones also understood at that time that LSB was required to track its inventory costs in order to 
remain on LIFO. 
        
       6.     In April 2004, Jones learned that, due to rising costs, the value of LSB’s LIFO 
reserve was not declining in the normal course of business as expected.  Whereas LSB had 
previously forecast that the LIFO reserve would decline to $250,000 in the normal course of 
business by the end of 2004, Jones learned in April 2004 that the reserve remained at $503,000 as  
of March 31, 2004, and was expected to decline by only $40,000 in fiscal year 2004 and was 
therefore still expected to be material to LSB’s net income. 
        
       7.     To avoid having to file a  restatement, Jones improperly directed his subordinates to 
make journal entries that artificially reduced LSB’s LIFO reserve by $125,000 in each quarter of 
2004, so that the LIFO reserve account’s year-end balance was zero by December 31, 2004.  These 
entries resulted in corresponding increases in LSB’s operating income by $125,000 in each quarter.  
The only justification for these entries was the elimination of the LIFO reserve to avoid 
restatement.  Jones did not inform LSB’s chief financial officer of his decision to bleed down the  
LIFO reserve, even though LSB’s internal controls policies required Jones to note any item with a 
potential financial statement impact of at least $100,000 on a quarterly “Issues List” for the CFO to  
review.  In fact, Jones did not  inform LSB’s CFO of the bleed down at any point in 2004, even 
though LSB’s internal controls required him to do so. 
        
       8.     By the time LSB filed its Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2004 on May 14, 2004, 
it had effectively changed from LIFO to FIFO for financial reporting purposes.  The change was 
material:  the value of LSB’s LIFO reserve was $503,000 while its first quarter operating results 
were a $243,000 net loss.  Had LSB instead released the entire amount of the LIFO reserve in that 
quarter, it would have reported $260,000 net income.  Nevertheless, LSB failed to comply with 
APB 20’s restatement and disclosure requirements in its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 
31, 2004.  Not only did LSB fail to disclose its change from LIFO to FIFO in this filing, but it 
falsely disclosed in this Form 10-Q that it was continuing to price inventory using the LIFO 
methodology. 
        

                                                 
                                               4 

---------------------Page 5---------------------

       9.     As a result of the decision to bleed down the LIFO reserve by $125,000 each  
quarter, LSB understated its net loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 by $125,000, a 51 
percent understatement.  LSB reported a net loss of $118,000; its actual (restated) net loss was 
$243,000.  LSB also reported a loss per share of 1 cent instead of 2 cents for the quarter, a 50 
percent understatement.     
        
       10.    LSB continued to reduce its LIFO reserve by $125,000 each quarter throughout the 
remainder of 2004.  This led LSB to overstate its income in its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended 
June 30, 2004 by $125,000, or 7.8 percent, and to overstate its income for the six-month period 
ended June 30, 2004 by $250,000, or  18.4 percent.  LSB reported earnings per share of 8 cents  
instead of 7 cents for that quarter, a 12.5 percent overstatement, and earnings per share of 6 cents  
instead of 5 cents for the six-month period ended June 30, 2004, a 16.7 percent overstatement.   
Again, LSB disclosed that it was continuing to value inventory using the LIFO methodology in its 
Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2004.   
        
       11.    As a result of LSB’s decision to bleed down the LIFO reserve by $125,000 each 
quarter, LSB overstated its income in its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 by 
$125,000, or 3.7 percent, and by $375,000, or 7.9 percent, for  the nine-month period ended 
September 30, 2004.  LSB also reported earnings per share of 19 cents instead of 18 cents for the 
quarter, a 5.6 percent overstatement, and 26 cents instead of 24 cents for the 9-month period ended  
September 30, 2004, an 8 percent overstatement.       
        
       12.    The bleed-down plan also led LSB to overstate its net income for the annual period 
by $503,000, or 36.7 percent, in its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004.  LSB 
reported net income of $1.873 million for the year; its actual (restated) net income was $1.370 
million.  LSB also reported earnings per share for this annual period of 1 cent instead of a loss per 
share of 3 cents.   
        
       13.    As principal accounting officer for LSB, Jones was responsible for the preparation 
of its financial statements.  He reviewed and signed the Forms 10-Q for the quarters ended March 
31, 2004, June 30, 2004, and September 30, 2004, and the Form 10-K for the year ended 
December 31, 2004.   
        
       14.    Following a series of comment letters to LSB from the Commission’s Division of  
Corporation Finance that questioned how LSB’s change from LIFO to FIFO complied with APB 
20, on December 30, 2005, LSB disclosed the change and filed an amended Form 10-K in which it 
restated its financials for the year ended December 31, 2004.  The amended Form 10-K restated the  
financial statements and corrected the disclosure issues described in paragraphs 8-12 above. 
        

                                                 
                                               5

                                           Violations  
 
       1.     Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 
require issuers with securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act to file quarterly and 
annual reports with the Commission and to keep this information current.  The obligation to file 
such reports also embodies the requirement that they be true and correct.  See, e.g., SEC v. Savoy 
Indus., Inc., 587 F.2d 1149, 1165 (D.C. Cir. 1978).  Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 also require issuers to  
file annual and quarterly financial statements that comply with Regulation S-X.  Regulation S-X, 
Section 4-01(a) mandates that financial statements and the accompanying notes be presented in 
conformity with GAAP. 
        
       2.     Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act requires Section 12 registrants to make  
and keep books, records, and accounts that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and 
dispositions of their assets. 
        
       3.     Section 13(b)(5) of the  Exchange Act provides that  no person shall knowingly 
falsify any such book, record, or account or circumvent internal controls.  Exchange Act Rule  
13b2-1 also prohibits the falsification of any book, record, or account subject to Section 
13(b)(2)(A). 
        
       4.     By failing to comply with APB 20’s restatement and disclosure requirements, 
misstating its financial results during the first three quarters of fiscal year 2004 and the full fiscal 
year 2004 by bleeding down its LIFO reserve quarterly by $125,000, and falsely stating in its 
Forms 10-Q for the first and second quarters of 2004 that it maintained LIFO inventory, LSB 
violated Exchange Act Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13.   

       5.     Rather than comply with APB 20’s restatement and disclosure requirements,  Jones  
directed his subordinates to bleed down LSB’s LIFO reserve during 2004.  Jones also failed to 
comply with LSB’s requirement that he alert the company’s CFO to items with a financial 
statement impact exceeding $100,000.  Moreover,  Jones, as LSB’s Chief Accounting Officer, was 
responsible for LSB’s false disclosures in its Forms 10-Q for the first and second quarters of 2004 
that it maintained LIFO inventory.  Jones knew that LSB’s Forms 10-Q for  the first three quarters 
of fiscal year 2004 and Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004 materially overstated 
LSB’s reported net income.  Jones also knew that LSB’s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 
31, 2004 failed to comply with  APB 20.  Finally, Jones knew or should have known that LSB’s  
Forms 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2004 and June 30, 2004 contained false disclosures 
that LSB maintained inventory using the LIFO pricing methodology.  As a result of this conduct, 
Jones willfully violated Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Rule 13b2-1 and caused and willfully 
aided and abetted LSB’s violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A), and Rules 
13a-1 and 13a-13.

                                           Findings  
        
       1.     Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that LSB violated Exchange Act 
Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A), and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13. 
        
       2.     Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that Jones willfully violated  
Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Rule 13b2-1, and caused and willfully aided and abetted LSB’s 
violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A), and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13. 
        
       3.     Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that Jones willfully violated and 
willfully aided and abetted the violation of provisions of the federal securities laws and rules 
thereunder within the meaning of Exchange Act  Section 4C(a)(3) and Rule 102(e)(1)(iii) of the 
Commission’s Rules of Practice.

       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in the Respondents’ Offers. 
 
       Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:  
 
       A.     LSB Industries, Inc. shall cease and desist from committing or causing any 
violations and any future violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act, and 
Exchange Act Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13;   
 
       B.     Jimmie Dean Jones shall cease and desist from committing or causing any violations  
and any future violations of Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, 
and from causing any violations and any future  violations of Sections  13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and 
Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13;   
        
       C.     Respondent Jimmie Dean Jones is denied the privilege of appearing or practicing 
before the Commission as an accountant.   
 
       D.     After two years from the date of this order, Respondent Jimmie Dean Jones  
may request that the Commission consider his reinstatement by submitting an application 
(attention: Office of the Chief Accountant) to resume appearing or practicing before the  
Commission as: 
      
                                1. a preparer or reviewer, or a person responsible for the preparation or 
review, of any public company’s financial statements that are filed with the Commission.  Such 
an application must satisfy the Commission that Respondent’s work in his practice before the 
Commission will be reviewed either by the independent audit committee of the public company 
for which he works or in some other acceptable manner, as long as he practices before the 
Commission in this capacity; and/or  
      

                                                 
                                               7

                 2.      an independent accountant.  Such an application must satisfy the 
Commission that: 
      
                            (a)   Respondent, or the public accounting firm with which he is 
associated, is registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight              Board (“Board”) in 
accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and such registration continues to be effective; 
 
                         (b)      Respondent, or the registered      public accounting firm with which he 
is associated, has been inspected by the Board and that inspection did not identify any criticisms  
of or potential defects in the respondent’s or the firm’s quality control system that would indicate 
that the respondent will not receive appropriate supervision; 

                  (c)             Respondent has resolved all di     sciplinary issues with the Board, and 
has complied with all terms and conditions of any sanctions imposed by the Board (other than 
reinstatement by the Commission); and 
 
                         (d)      Respondent acknowledges        his responsibility, as long as 
Respondent appears or practices before the Commission as an independent accountant, to 
comply with all requirements of the Commission and the Board, including, but not limited to, all 
requirements relating to registration, inspections, concurring partner reviews and quality control 
standards. 
 
                   E. The Commission will consider an application by Respondent to resume           
appearing or practicing before the Commission provided that his state CPA license is 
current and he has resolved all other disciplinary issues with the applicable state boards of 
accountancy.  However, if state licensure is dependent on reinstatement by the 
Commission, the Commission will consider an application on its other merits.  The 
Commission’s review may include consideration of, in addition to the matters referenced 
above, any other matters relating to Respondent’s character, integrity, professional conduct, 
or qualifications to appear or practice before the Commission. 
                                     
 
 
 By the Commission.
