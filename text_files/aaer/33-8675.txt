A. RESPONDENTS 
 
       1.      PKF, an accounting firm based in the  United Kingdom, was AremisSoft 
Corporations (AremisSofts) principal outside auditor from before AremisSoft was a public 
company until January 23, 2002.  PKF is the eighth largest firm of accountants and business 
advisers in the United Kingdom, with more than 1,500 partners and staff operating from 25 
offices in the United Kingdom.  4
                                   PKF is a member firm of PKF International Ltd., a network of 
independent firms of accountants and business advisers with more than 430 member firm offices, 
which have 12,800 staff and partners in more than 100 countries.   
 
       2.           Anthony Frederick John Mead (Mead), age 64, was a partner of PKF until 
he took his standard retirement on April 6, 2002.  He is a Fellow of the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants (FCA) in England and Wales and was the audit partner for PKFs audits of 
AremisSoft while AremisSoft was a public company.  Mead had specific responsibilities for 
planning, supervising, and reviewing the audit work.   
        

                                                 
2
  Simultaneously with this proceeding, the Commission filed a settled action in which PKF and Mead, without 
admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, consented to the entry of final judgments by 
the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York pursuant to Section 21(d) of the Exchange Act.  The 
Commissions complaint alleges that PKF violated Section 10A of the Exchange Act, and that Mead violated 
Section 10A(a) of the Exchange Act.  The final judgment as to PKF (1) orders PKF to pay a $2 million civil penalty; 
and (2) orders PKF to pay disgorgement of audit fees of $309,048 and to pay prejudgment interest thereon of 
$87,090.  The final judgment as to Mead orders Mead to pay a $50,000 civil penalty.

       3.     Barnsdall, age 44, is an audit partner of PKF.  He was the concurring partner on 
PKFs audit of AremisSofts fiscal year 2000 financial statements.  Barnsdall is an Associate of 
the Institute of Chartered Accountants (ACA) in England and Wales. 
 
B. OTHER RELEVANT PARTIES 
 
       1.     Savvides & Partners/PKF Cyprus (PKF Cyprus) is an accounting firm with 
offices in Limassol, Cyprus and Nicosia, Cyprus.  It is a member of PKF International Ltd.  PKF 
Cyprus performed audit work on several AremisSoft subsidiaries during the year 2000 audit of 
AremisSoft. 
 
       2. Pavlos Meletiou          (Meletiou) was a partner of PKF Cyprus while AremisSoft 
was a public company.  Meletiou was responsible for the audits and reviews of the AremisSoft 
subsidiaries that PKF Cyprus conducted.  He was a certified accountant in Cyprus until his 
license was revoked by the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Cyprus (ICPAC) in 
June 2005 for, among other things, failing to comply with independence rules and failing to 
submit correct information to the ICPAC. 
        
       3.     AremisSoft Corporation, a Delaware corporation headquartered in London, was 
an international software company with offices in New Jersey, London, Cyprus, and India.  
AremisSoft became a public company in April 1999 through an initial public offering of 3.3 
million shares.  Until trading in AremisSoft stock was halted on July 30, 2001, its shares 
(symbol:  AREM) traded on the Nasdaq National Market System.  On August 29, 2001, Nasdaq 
delisted AremisSofts common stock from the Nasdaq system.  In a settlement with the 
Commission, AremisSoft consented to a judgment enjoining it from violating the antifraud and 
reporting provisions of the federal securities laws.  The judgment, entered on July 22, 2002, 
binds AremisSofts successor, Softbrands, Inc.  In the settlement, AremisSoft consented to the 
issuance of a Commission Order revoking the registration of its common stock.  The 
Commissions Revocation Order was issued on July 31, 2002.  AremisSofts fiscal year ended on 
December 31. 
 
C. FACTS 
 
       1.           Summary of Fraud at AremisSoft 
 
       AremisSoft went public in April 1999, and reported revenues of $52.6 million for 1998, 
$73.4 million for 1999, and $123.6 million for 2000.  In November 2000, AremisSoft had a 
market capitalization of more than $1 billion.  Eight months later, the company failed to file its 
second quarter 2001 Form 10-Q with the Commission.  Shortly thereafter, as part of an internal 
investigation, PKF conducted a special forensic review, which found that AremisSoft could not 
confirm receipt of $5.4 million in revenues on its most significant contract.  Thereafter 
AremisSoft announced that it could not substantiate approximately $90 million of the revenues 
the company reported in 2000.  On March 15, 2002 AremisSoft filed for bankruptcy. 
 
       AremisSoft and its co-chairmen and co-CEOs Roys Poyiadjis (Poyiadjis) and 
Lycourgos Kyprianou (Kyprianou) (sued by the Commission in                          SEC v. AremisSoft 

                                          - 3 - 
---------------------Page 4---------------------

Corporation, Roys Poyiadjis, Lycourgos Kyprianou, et al., Civil Action No. 01 CV 8903 
[S.D.N.Y.]) engaged in a number of fraudulent practices to make it appear as if AremisSoft was 
a sprawling international software company with accelerating sales growth.  AremisSoft booked 
fictitious sales and accounts receivable and overstated earnings in two Cyprus-based subsidiaries, 
AremisSoft (EE.ME.A.) Ltd. (EEM) and L.K. Global Information Systems B.V. (LK 
Global).  In its 2000 Form 10-K, AremisSoft reported that $97.5 million of its $123.6 million in 
revenues (nearly 80%) came from these two Cyprus-based subsidiaries, when, in fact, together, 
the two subsidiaries had just $1.7 million in revenues for the year. 
        
       To hide its revenue and earnings shortfall in EEM and LK Global, AremisSoft reported 
acquisitions at inflated prices, making it seem as if cash AremisSoft collected from customers 
was used to purchase companies.  In December 1999, AremisSoft announced that it had acquired 
a company called e-nnovations.com for $14.5 million in cash.  In its 2000 Form 10-K, 
AremisSoft reported that it had acquired two companies in December 2000, e-ChaRM Pvt Ltd. 
(e-ChaRM), for cash of $10.9 million and Denon International Ltd. (Denon), for cash of 
$7.34 million.  In September 2001, AremisSoft acknowledged in a press release that the three 
acquisitions had been reported at amounts not substantiated by information developed in the 
internal investigation.  Rather than the $7.34 million to $14.5 million purchase prices reported, 
the actual prices paid ranged from approximately $200,000 to $400,000. 
        
       AremisSoft also grossly misstated its cash balance as of December 31, 2000.  AremisSoft 
claimed to have $33.33 million in cash, but $9.98 million of that cash was actually in 
Kyprianous personal bank account and $10.7 million of it was received by AremisSoft in mid-
January 2001.  Accordingly, AremisSoft should have reported no more than $12.65 million of 
cash at December 31, 2000, and should have reported a $10.7 million reduction in stockholders 
equity. 
       2.           PKFs Involvement with AremisSoft 
       At the time of the 2000 audit, PKF had been AremisSofts outside auditor for a number 
of years, including the period before AremisSofts initial public offering in April 1999.  PKF 
audited AremisSofts annual financial statements and, beginning in 2000, conducted reviews of 
its quarterly financial statements.5
                                    AremisSoft was PKFs only client to file with the 
Commission.   
       PKF used the work and reports of other auditing firms to report on AremisSofts 2000 
consolidated financial statements.  One of the firms, PKF Cyprus, a Cyprus-based accounting 
firm, issued unqualified audit reports on EEM and LK Global.  Meletiou, a PKF Cyprus partner, 
signed or directed the issuance of the audit reports for PKF Cyprus.  PKF assumed complete 
responsibility under generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS) for the work of the other 
auditing firms during the 2000 audit and did not refer to the work of other auditors in its audit 
report or in AremisSofts 2000 filing with the Commission.  6

                                                 
5
  PKF also reviewed AremisSofts financial statements as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2001, filed 
with the Commission on May 15, 2001. 
 
6
  GAAS require that an audit report should contain a clear-cut indication of the auditors work, if any, and the 
degree of responsibility the auditor is taking.  See AICPA, CODIFICATION OF STATEMENTS ON AUDITING 
STANDARDS (AU) 150.02.  PKF could have referred to the work done by PKF Cyprus and the other audit firms 

                                           - 4 - 
---------------------Page 5---------------------

        
       On March 22, 2001, PKF issued an unqualified audit report on AremisSofts 2000 
financial statements, which stated that PKF had conducted its audits in accordance with GAAS 
and that AremisSofts financial statements presented AremisSofts consolidated financial 
position fairly, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  The 
unqualified audit report was filed with the Commission as part of AremisSofts Form 10-K for 
2000. 
        
       Contrary to the representations in PKFs audit report, AremisSofts 2000 financial 
statements did not conform to GAAP and the audit was not conducted in accordance with GAAS 
in effect at the time of the audit.7
                                    On December 7, 2001, PKF advised AremisSoft that its audit 
reports must no longer be associated with [AremisSofts financial] statements and that such 
auditors reports should no longer be relied on. 
       3.           PKF and Mead Engaged in Improper Professional Conduct 
                                                   
       With respect to accountants, Rule 102(e)(1) provides that improper professional 
conduct includes highly unreasonable conduct that results in a violation of applicable 
professional standards in circumstances in which an accountant knows, or should know, that 
heightened scrutiny is warranted.  PKF and Mead engaged in improper professional conduct in 
connection with the audit of AremisSofts 2000 financial statements.  PKF and Mead engaged in 
highly unreasonable conduct that resulted in repeated violations of applicable professional 
standards in circumstances in which PKF and Mead knew or should have known warranted 
heightened scrutiny.    
 
               (a)        Failure to Adequately Staff the Audit  
       Under GAAS (AU 150.02), audits are required to be performed by a person or persons 
having adequate technical training and proficiency as an auditor.  The auditor having ultimate 
authority for the audit should know, at a minimum, the relevant professional accounting and 
auditing standards and should be knowledgeable about the client.  The auditor with final 
responsibility is responsible for the assignment of tasks to, and supervision of, assistants.  (AU 
230.06). 
              Partners and staff assigned to the AremisSoft audit had little, if any, experience in GAAS 
or GAAP.  Neither the audit partner, Mead, nor the concurring partner on the 2000 audit, 
Barnsdall, had significant training or experience in GAAS or GAAP.  The PKF staff person with 
the most significant involvement with the 2000 audits of EEM and LK Global had limited 
familiarity with GAAS or GAAP and no training in conducting audits of U.S. companies.  
Likewise, PKF Cyprus had little knowledge of GAAS or GAAP or experience in conducting 
U.S. company audits.  Meletiou also had no significant training or experience in conducting 

                                                                                                                                                             
in the audit report, thereby sharing audit responsibility with them.  If a principal auditor refers to the work of another 
auditor, the report is expanded to indicate the division of responsibility and magnitude of the portion of the financial 
statements audited by the other auditor (AU 543, Part of Audit Performed by Other Independent Auditors).  By not 
referring to the work of PKF Cyprus or other accounting firms involved in the audit, PKF took full responsibility for 
their work. 
 
7
  In this order, GAAP and GAAS refer to U.S. GAAP and U.S. GAAS, respectively. 

                                            - 5 -

audits under GAAS or GAAP.  PKF did not comply with GAAS, notwithstanding that a director 
of another PKF International member firm in the United States provided certain advice 
concerning GAAS and GAAP to PKF during its 2000 audit engagement in his role as filing 
reviewer.  The filing reviewer, however, was not aware of the nature and extent of the warning 
signs, nor was he involved in all audit matters. 
 
              (b)        Failure to Obtain Sufficient Competent Evidential Matter 
       GAAS requires that an audit of the financial statements be planned and performed to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material 
misstatement, whether caused by error or fraud.  (AU 316.01).  Auditors must consider potential 
fraud factors when planning and performing the audit.  GAAS states that the assessment of the 
risk of material misstatement due to fraud is a cumulative process and one that should be 
ongoing throughout the audit.  (See AU 316).  Auditors must obtain sufficient competent 
evidence to afford a basis for an opinion regarding the financial statements under audit.  (AU 
326.01).  The validity and sufficiency of required evidence depends on the circumstances and the 
auditors' judgment, but should be persuasive though it need not be convincing.  (AU 326.02 
& .21-.23).  With respect to such judgment, an auditor must maintain an attitude of professional 
skepticism and assess the risk that errors and irregularities may cause the financial statements to 
contain a material misstatement.  (AU 316.13).  An assessment of higher risk may cause the 
auditor to expand the extent of procedures applied or modify the nature and/or the timing of 
procedures to obtain more persuasive evidence.   
       PKF and Mead failed to comply with these requirements and failed to exercise the 
required heightened degree of professional skepticism or to obtain sufficient competent 
evidential matter concerning AremisSofts financial statements -- even after being confronted 
with numerous warning signs before and during the performance of the audit that should have 
alerted PKF and Mead to the possibility that AremisSofts financial statements were materially 
misstated. 
              Anonymous Letter, Suspicious Contracts, and CFO Resignation 
 
       PKF had been AremisSofts auditor until May 15, 1998, when the London office of a 
Big Four accounting firm was engaged to audit AremisSofts financial statements in 
connection with AremisSofts registration statement (Form S-1) filed with the Commission on 
July 1, 1998.8
               On July 14, 1998, the Big Four accounting firm received a copy of an anonymous 
letter addressed to the SEC.  According to the letter: 
    
              AremisSoft wants to register statements to sell shares on the United 
              States Nasdaq exchange.  These statements will contain fraudulent 
              information about revenue ... for large [sales] of management services 
              and contracts.  The chairman and managing directors and [lawyers] in 
              the United Kingdom are [recording revenue] from some former 
              directors, some customers, some not, to issue purchase notes of one 
              million dollars or greater each for services to be provided .... This 
              done to make future look good for sells [sic] of shares. 

                                                 
8
  This registration statement never went effective.

              Review accounts and you will locate. 
    
When the Big Four firm reviewed AremisSofts draft financial statements for the six months 
ended June 30, 1998, it found that the financial statements included revenue from three contracts 
for more than $1 million each.  The contracts were purportedly being performed in AremisSofts 
Indian office (which had no significant previous sales), and the customers were allegedly in 
Czechoslovakia and Croatia (where the company had not previously done business).  The Big 
Four firm immediately requested full details of the contracts, including agreements and customer 
correspondence, and consulted the underwriters; they had no knowledge of the contracts, despite 
having been provided a list of AremisSofts work in the pipeline just four months earlier. 
       Based on this information, the Big Four firm undertook an investigation into the three 
contracts, which uncovered numerous irregularities, including:  (1) all negotiations with 
customers on the contracts were undertaken by Kyprianou and communications were claimed to 
have been by e-mail, no copies of which were maintained; (2) copies of the contracts were held 
in Kyprianous private office in Cyprus rather than the corporate offices in London; (3) all 
information relating to the contracts was in India; (4) no cash was received from the customers; 
(5) no payments were made to the consultants performing sub-contracting work on the contracts; 
and (6) the customer addresses appeared to be small offices rather than industrial concerns.  
Moreover, staff from one of the Big Four firms Indian offices raised doubts as to whether the 
main subcontractor on the contracts was capable of performing the contract work.   
       As a result of its review, the Big Four firm concluded that AremisSofts percentage of 
completion method of revenue recognition for the three contracts was improper.  Rather, it 
determined, the completed contract method should be used, resulting in deletion of all revenue 
and gross profit related to the purported contracts from AremisSofts income statement and 
deferred recognition until the contracts were completed and the related fees collected.  
AremisSoft agreed to the change.   
       On October 9, 1998, the Big Four firm received a telefax from AremisSofts then chief 
financial officer (CFO), complaining of his inability to get access to  financial records to 
ensure that the [financial statements] are objective, true and fair.  The CFO expressed concern 
about Kyprianous significant involvement and influence in the preparation of the [financial 
statements].  In a telephone conversation with the Big Four firm audit partner, the CFO denied 
having any knowledge of the three contracts prior to April 1998. 
        
       On October 15, 1998, representatives from the Big Four firm met with Poyiadjis, 
Kyprianou, AremisSofts then CFO, and others, to discuss the CFOs allegations and the 
accounting for the three contracts.  Also attending the meeting and introduced as a prospective 
director of AremisSoft was a corporate finance partner from PKF, who, according to 
AremisSofts year 2000 Form 10-K, was then PKFs head of the United Kingdom and European 
mergers and acquisition group.  There were heated exchanges concerning the contracts at the 
meeting.  The PKF corporate finance partner stated that the Big Four firm was unable to verify 
the contracts because it did not understand AremisSofts business, and suggested that AremisSoft 
re-engage PKF to perform the audit work. 
       Shortly thereafter, AremisSofts CFO resigned and Poyiadjis assumed the CFO duties.  In 
November 1998, the Big Four firm was informed that AremisSoft had made a decision to      

                                          - 7 - 
---------------------Page 8---------------------

re-appoint PKF as its independent auditor and the engagement of the Big Four firm was 
discontinued as of December 16, 1998.  PKF was then re-engaged as AremisSofts independent 
auditor.  The PKF corporate finance partner who attended the October 15 meeting became the 
relationship partner and Mead became the audit partner on the AremisSoft audit engagement.  
On or about this time, PKF obtained copies of the anonymous letter and the October 9 telefax 
from AremisSofts CFO.  
       AremisSofts financial statements eventually filed in connection with its initial public 
offering in April 1999 included the revenues and gross profit from the three large contracts, and 
employed the percentage of completion method.  These financial statements were audited by 
PKF.  AremisSoft continued to use that method throughout its existence as a public company.  
       The three large contracts were shams.  AremisSoft never performed any services related 
to the contracts and never collected any revenues from the purported customers.   
               AremisSofts Inadequate Accounting Staff  
               and Questionable Revenue Recognition 
                
              In its 1999 management letter, issued in March 2000, PKF expressed concern that 
AremisSofts internal accounting function [relied] very heavily on its [outside] professional 
advisers in connection with US reporting and disclosure requirements.  On May 2, 2000, the 
Chairman of AremisSofts audit committee recommended in a memorandum to Kyprianou and 
Poyiadjis -- forwarded to PKFs Mead -- that AremisSoft hire a senior financial person, citing 
a few close calls with respect to our financial reporting, which had been brought to the audit 
committees attention.  But in PKFs 2000 audit checklist entitled Consideration of Fraud and 
Error, the question whether there was significant or prolonged under-staffing of [AremisSofts] 
accounting department was answered in the negative. 
              During PKFs interim work during 2000, PKF saw additional warning signs that should 
have further heightened concern about AremisSofts accounting.  During PKFs quarterly review 
of AremisSofts June 30, 2000 financial statements, a PKF staff accountant wrote that an 
AremisSoft employee had told him about a potential cut-off problem, i.e., improper delay of 
revenue.  The staff accountants notes say the June 2000 quarter accounted for a large element 
that should have been booked in the first quarter of the year.   
              PKF and Mead did not appropriately consider how these risk factors affected the audit, 
nor revise the audit plan, nor took any additional steps to gain an understanding of AremisSofts 
operations sufficient to detect the ongoing fraud.9

  In addition, in December 2000, the filing reviewer from a PKF-member firm in the United States cautioned PKF 
staff and Mead about potential improper revenue acceleration by AremisSoft in one of its UK divisions.  In an e-
mail, he wrote: 
               It seems that [AremisSoft is] trying hard to recognize more revenue in the year 
               2000.  My suggestion is that you include in your audit procedures additional 
               steps to ensure that revenue is being properly recorded. 
PKF staff forwarded this e-mail to the PKF manager on the engagement, adding:  This came in from [the PKF 
International Ltd. member firm director] last weekhe seems quite concerned!  While PKF addressed this issue in 
the context of its audit of the AremisSoft UK division, it never considered how this information affected other 
AremisSoft divisions or the overall audit.

              Warning Signs in Cyprus 
              Though AremisSofts Cyprus-run operations represented just a fraction of its business 
before it went public, they accounted for nearly 80% of AremisSofts revenues and over 50% of 
its assets by the time of the 2000 audit.  Accordingly, and because PKF took responsibility for 
the entire audit, Mead assigned a PKF accountant to Cyprus in late January 2001 to work with 
Meletiou, the PKF Cyprus partner, on the Cyprus-based subsidiaries.  But that staff accountant 
was relatively junior and had no training or background in GAAP or GAAS. 
       Although AremisSofts CEO and CFO had offices in Cyprus and EEM and LK Global 
were both headquartered there, the staff accountant learned upon his arrival in Cyprus that the 
contracts and accounting records for both subsidiaries were actually in India, not Cyprus.  This 
made it impossible for the staff accountant to conduct substantive revenue testing in Cyprus, 
although the staff accountant did prepare audit work programs for Meletiou to use in performing 
the audit.  The staff accountant notes show that he told Mead that documents necessary for 
testing were unavailable and alerted him to shortcomings of the audits being performed, 
particularly the lack of documented testing, and address [sic] of fundamental issues such as 
debtor recoverability, cut-off testing, systems understanding, and post balance sheet event 
reviews.  His notes also reflect that, when he advised Meletiou about his concerns, especially 
the limited audit testing, Meletiou suggested that the testing be carried out after the audit, i.e., 
April/May 2001!!!  The staff accountant telephoned Mead regarding his conversation with 
Meletiou. 
              In early February 2001, the staff accountant returned with Mead to Cyprus to conduct the 
audit work he was previously unable to perform, including a review of previously unavailable 
documents.  But no one from PKF ever reviewed any cash receipts related to purported contracts. 
Instead, PKF limited its testing based on its reliance on AremisSofts internal control system.  
After the second trip to Cyprus, Mead sent a telefax to Meletiou enumerating a number of 
outstanding steps required to be completed prior to the audit close and emphasizing that Meletiou 
needed to travel to India to conduct audit tests on AremisSofts internal controls.  Meletiou 
agreed he or someone on his staff would go to India for the systems testing, but no one from PKF 
determined whether such testing ever occurred.   
              Account Managers in 2000 
                                                 
       PKF and Mead learned for the first time, during the January 2001 trip to Cyprus, that 
neither EEM nor LK Global had any regular contact with their customers.  Rather, since 2000, 
both had purportedly used third party contractors -- called account managers -- to bill 
customers, collect funds due, and remit the difference net of expenses to AremisSoft, making 
periodic reports of gross sales and expenses for incorporation in AremisSofts books and 
records.  The EEM and LK Global general ledgers reflect that neither subsidiary recorded 
accounts receivable by customer; both relied only on reports of the account managers. 
       Despite the account managers obvious importance to AremisSoft and their role as sole 
source for EEM and LK Global sales and expense data, neither PKF nor Mead ever (a) 
developed any audit procedures to examine transactions with the account managers; (b) reviewed 
payments from account managers; (c) communicated with account managers; (d) saw any of the 
periodic reports; (e) took any steps to audit transactions between AremisSoft and the account 
managers or between the account managers and AremisSofts customers; or (f) designed any 

                                          - 9 - 
---------------------Page 10---------------------

procedures to test AremisSofts progress on contracts.  Instead PKF and Mead relied solely on 
AremisSofts representations with respect to the sham contracts and the review of the PKF 
Cyprus audit files, which included false documentation. 
               EEM and LK Global Audit File Deficiencies 
       On March 9, 2001, Meletiou brought the EEM and LK Global audit files to PKFs 
London office.  Mead spent five hours reviewing the EEM audit files and assigned a second PKF 
partner, who had no knowledge of AremisSoft, to review the LK Global audit files.    10

              Mead found numerous problems in the EEM audit file, including serious deficiencies in 
two significant audit areas -- cash and accounts receivable.  Meads notes show the workpapers 
included only copies, not originals, of cash confirmations, and both cash and accounts receivable 
confirmations were apparently not received directly by PKF [Cyprus].  Moreover, 
confirmations of deposits and payables purportedly from numerous different customers and 
vendors were poor copies, not originals, and inventory confirmations were provided by 
AremisSoft management rather than third parties.   
       The second PKF partner found multiple problems in the LK Global audit file including 
similar problems with cash and accounts receivable.  His three page hand-written notes to Mead 
noted that: 
                   •  LK Global had no bank account;  
                    
                   •  The file contained copies of accounts receivable confirmations, not 
                      originals; 
 
                   •  The file contained no evidence of how accounts receivable confirmations 
                      were carried out; 
 
                   •  The file contained no evidence of an overall analytical review; 
 
                   •  The file contained no evidence of audit planning, an adopted audit 
                      approach, or a risk assessment; 
 
                   •  The file contained no evidence of a review of internal controls; 
 
                   •  The file included no evidence of a subsequent events review; and 
 
                   •  There was no engagement letter in the file. 
 
Late that same night, the second PKF partner wrote Mead an e-mail from his home computer that 
concluded:

   Approximately two and one-half weeks earlier, on February 20, 2001, AremisSofts audit committee held a 
telephone conference call concerning its earnings release for the 2000 year.  PKF participated in the call and 
expressed no objection to the release.  The next day, February 21, AremisSoft issued its year 2000 earnings release. 
 

                                           - 10 -

              I suppose I am nervous about the fact that we have a company 
              generating $20 million + [sales] and quite significant profits, all of 
              it being on paper with no evidence of any cash  it just seems 
              suspicious.  The more I think about it, the more unusual the whole 
              thing seems and I think we need convincing explanations before 
              sign off.  
On March 20, 2001, Mead received an e-mail from Meletiou asserting that [a]ll outstanding 
points that should be dealt with before signing the report have been completed except the 
management letter which is under preparation.  But no one from PK  F ever collected any 
documents or other evidence to support Meletious contention. 
                    EEM and LK Global General Ledger Irregularities 
       The EEM and LK Global general ledgers included in PKFs files showed obvious 
irregularities.  Most of the ledger entries simply reflect assets netted against liabilities to 
eliminate account balances. All of the entries appear to have been created at the same time -- 
after AremisSofts year-end.  Moreover, the ledgers reflected cash receipts of only $4.3 million 
for the entire year, even though EEM and LK Global reported more than $97 million in 
combined sales that year.  
                      Questionable AremisSoft Acquisitions 
       AremisSoft reported in its 1999 and 2000 Forms 10-K that it paid over $32 million in 
cash to acquire three companies -- e-nnovations.com., e-ChaRM, and Denon.  However, PKF 
and Mead failed to examine any documents purportedly evidencing the payments.  Had PKF or 
Mead matched the transactions to payment documents, it would have been discovered that, rather 
than the $7 to $14.5 million purchase prices reportedly paid for these companies, the actual 
prices ranged from approximately $200,000 to $400,000. 
                      Inadequate Third Party Confirmations  
       At no time during its audit did PKF or Mead obtain original accounts receivable or cash 
confirmations, verify that the confirmations had been sent directly to PKF Cyprus or PKF, or 
review subsequent cash receipts to corroborate that the receivables in fact existed.  No one from 
PKF reviewed accounts receivable remittance advices or attempted to contact any of 
AremisSofts purported customers.  Had PKF or Mead taken any of these steps, they would have 
learned that the accounts receivable and associated revenues were fraudulent.  And while the 
PKF Cyprus audit workpapers reviewed by PKF included confirmations from LK Global 
creditors, in what should have been an obvious irregularity that should have warranted 
heightened scrutiny, all creditors confirmed that they owed money to LK Global rather than the 
other way around. 
              The accounts receivable confirmations in the PKF Cyprus audit workpapers reviewed by 
PKF and Mead evidence additional irregularities that should have warranted heightened scrutiny.  
None are originals; many have identical or similar handwriting; and, according to the dates 
printed on the top of each, eight of seventeen were returned on the same two dates -- February 2 
or February 5, 2001.  The accounts receivable confirmations also were addressed to customers of 
AremisSoft rather than to account managers -- despite the companys claim that the account 
managers, not the end users, were indebted to AremisSoft.   

                                         - 11 - 
---------------------Page 12---------------------

              PKF and Mead understood from the PKF Cyprus audit files that EEM maintained a Swiss 
bank account containing $9.98 million of AremisSofts cash (nearly 30% of total cash) on 
December 31, but PKF and Mead did not obtain satisfactory audit evidence concerning the bank 
account that was included as cash on AremisSofts consolidated financial statements.  The 
unnumbered Swiss bank account, which nowhere appears on EEMs ledger until December 23, 
2000, suddenly materialized immediately before AremisSofts year end.  The only evidence 
obtained by either PKF Cyprus or PKF from third parties related to the account is an irregular 
confirmation letter to Meletiou from a Swiss bank dated March 20, 2001 -- the same day as 
PKFs audit report -- which states, without explanation, that since 29th of December 2000, we 
hold an amount of $9.980.000 blocked in favor of [EEM].  AremisSoft had no such account at 
any time during or before 2000.  But Kyprianou did have bank accounts at the Swiss bank.  
Kyprianou deposited proceeds of his AremisSoft stock sales in those accounts.   
       Finally, neither PKF nor Mead obtained cash confirmations for AremisSofts cash held at 
U.S. banks at December 31, 2000, even though the company reported $10.7 million in a U.S. 
bank as of that date.  But the $10.7 million was not in a U.S. bank account as of December 31, 
2000.  PKFs workpapers show that the money was due to AremisSoft from Kyprianou and 
Poyiadjis stock options exercises in mid-December 2000.  PKF and Mead accepted the treatment 
of these funds as cash in transit as of December 31.  But the cash was not transferred from 
Poyiadjis Swiss bank accounts until mid-January.  Therefore those funds should not have been 
included in AremisSofts cash balance at December 31, 2000.   
              (c)         Failure to Obtain Sufficient Understanding of Internal Controls 
       PKF and Mead failed to comply with GAAS (AU 150.02), which requires an auditor to 
obtain a sufficient understanding of a companys system of internal controls to plan the audit and 
determine the nature, extent, and timing of testing to be performed.   
       PKF and Mead relied on AremisSofts system of internal controls to limit substantive 
testing of revenue reported by EEM and LK Global but neither obtained a sufficient 
understanding of the internal controls for these subsidiaries.  PKF and Mead did not obtain 
evidence that the accounting systems in India existed or were tested by Meletiou, or travel to 
India to test the systems.   
        
              (d)        Failure to Properly Plan the Audit 
                                                 
       GAAS requires that the auditor plan the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether caused by error or 
fraud.  (AU 316.01).  In planning, the auditor must assess the risk of material misstatement due 
to fraud or error, which includes consideration of conditions that may require extension or 
modification of audit tests, such as the risk of material errors or irregularities or the existence of 
related party transactions.  (AU 311.03; see also AU 316A (Consideration of Fraud in a 
Financial Statement Audit)).  In addition, the risk assessment process should be ongoing 
throughout the audit and should consider whether the nature of audit procedures performed 
may need to be changed to obtain evidence that is more reliable or to obtain additional 
corroborative information.  (AU 316.28).  Contrary to GAAS, PKF and Mead failed to 
adequately plan the 2000 audit after learning of numerous facts that, either standing alone or in 
the context of other facts learned prior to the audit, warranted heightened scrutiny that should 

                                         - 12 - 
---------------------Page 13---------------------

have alerted them to the possibility that AremisSofts financial statements might be misstated 
due to fraud. 
 
       In December 1998, PKF concluded that Kyprianous control and influence was a 
general risk factor.  However, neither PKF nor Mead considered this factor in planning the 
2000 audit and did not design or implement any audit procedures in consideration of 
Kyprianous control in its audit of AremisSofts year 2000 financial statements. 
        
       GAAS requires a specific substantive risk assessment and consideration of that 
assessment in designing the audit procedures to be performed.  (AU 312 & 316).  But PKF and 
Mead never undertook a substantive risk analysis in planning the 2000 audit; the audit planning 
was perfunctory at best.  PKF and Mead merely used standard checklist work programs that were 
not modified to account for AremisSofts high risk environment.  Despite being presented with 
numerous warning signs during its audit, PKF and Mead failed to design audit procedures to test 
AremisSofts revenues, accounts receivable, and cash accounts more extensively than originally 
planned or to heighten the scrutiny in the audit of the Cyprus subsidiaries.  Moreover, despite 
numerous warning signs, PKF and Mead failed to reassess whether the nature of audit 
procedures performed [needed] to be changed to obtain evidence that is more reliable or to 
obtain additional corroborative information.  (AU 316.52). 
 
              (e)         Failure to Exercise Due Professional Care and Professional 
                      Skepticism 
 
              GAAS requires that auditors exercise due professional care in performing an audit and in 
preparing the audit report.  (AU 230.01).  Due professional care requires that the auditor exercise 
professional skepticism in performing audit and review procedures and gathering and analyzing 
audit evidence.  (AU 230.07-.08).  In exercising professional skepticism, the auditor should not 
be satisfied with less than persuasive evidence because of a belief that management is honest.  
(AU 230.09).  Exercise of professional skepticism requires auditors to demonstrate a questioning 
mind and to critically assess audit evidence.  (AU 230; see also AU 316.13).   
 
       For all the reasons stated in the paragraphs above, PKF and Mead acted unreasonably in 
failing to exercise due professional care and professional skepticism in violation of this standard. 
        
              (f)         Failure to Issue Accurate Audit Reports 
              GAAS requires that the auditors report contain an opinion on the financial statements 
taken as a whole and contain a clear indication of the character of the auditors work.  (AU 
508.04).  The auditor can determine that he is able to issue an audit report containing an 
unqualified opinion only if he has conducted his audit in accordance with GAAS and the 
financial statements comply with GAAP.  (AU 508.07 & .22).   
              In auditing AremisSofts financial statements, PKF and Mead acted unreasonably in 
rendering audit reports containing unqualified opinions.  Mead signed and transmitted to 
AremisSoft's counsel PKFs audit report on AremisSofts year 2000 financial statements before 
Barnsdall conducted his concurring partner review.  PKF partners and employees knew or should 
have known that AremisSofts financial statements did not comply with GAAP and that PKF and 
Mead did not conduct the audits in accordance with GAAS.  Nevertheless, PKF and Mead issued 

                                          - 13 - 
---------------------Page 14---------------------

audit reports containing unqualified opinions that falsely stated that AremisSofts financial 
statements conformed to GAAP and that they had conducted the audits in accordance with 
GAAS.   
 
       4.           Barnsdall Engaged in Improper Professional Conduct 
 
       With respect to accountants, Rule 102(e)(1) provides that improper professional 
conduct includes repeated instances of unreasonable conduct, each resulting in a violation of 
applicable professional standards, that indicate a lack of competence to practice before the 
Commission.  Barnsdall engaged in improper professional conduct.  His conduct was 
unreasonable and resulted in violations of applicable professional standards. 
 
       As recited above at paragraph 3(e), AU 230.01, 230.07-.09, and 316.13, require auditors 
to exercise due professional care and maintain an attitude of professional skepticism, rely solely 
on persuasive audit evidence, demonstrate a questioning mind, and critically assess audit 
evidence.  GAAS also requires that auditors obtain sufficient competent evidential matter 
through inspection, observation, inquiries, and confirmations to afford a reasonable basis for an 
audit opinion.  (AU 326.01) 
 
       Barnsdall was the concurring partner on PKFs audit of AremisSofts year 2000 financial 
statements but did not participate in PKFs pre-2000 audits of AremisSoft .  He was required, as 
concurring partner, to be sufficiently involved in the review of the audit to reach informed 
conclusions regarding the quality and sufficiency of the audit procedures performed.  Barnsdall 
conducted his concurring partner review the day after Mead signed and transmitted to 
AremisSoft's counsel PKFs audit report for inclusion in AremisSofts year 2000 Form 10-K.  
But he backdated his sign-off to the date of the audit report.  He did not, indeed could not, review 
the EEM and LK Global files because they had already been returned to Cyprus by the time of 
his file review.  And although he reviewed the lists of notes prepared by Mead and the PKF 
partner who reviewed the LK Global audit files, he did not sufficiently follow up to ensure that 
the issues raised in those reviews were resolved.  In fact, certain of the most significant issues 
were not resolved.  Barnsdall acted unreasonably in failing to exercise due professional care and 
to maintain an attitude of professional skepticism, and to assure that the audit workpapers 
evidenced that sufficient competent evidential matter had been obtained to support the audit 
report, in violation of these standards.

Rule 12b-20 requires an issuer to provide any additional information in the reports necessary to 
make the reports not misleading.  The obligation to file these periodic reports includes the 
requirement that they be complete and accurate in all material respects.  See, e.g., United States 
v. Bilzerian, 926 F.2d 1285, 1298 (2d Cir. 1991); SEC v. Savoy Indus., Inc., 587 F.2d 1149, 1165 
(D.C. Cir. 1978).  No showing of scienter is necessary to establish a violation of Section 13(a) of 
the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 12b-20.  See Savoy Indus., Inc., 587 F.2d at 1167; SEC v. 
Wills, 472 F. Supp. 1250, 1268 (D.D.C. 1978).   
 
              Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act requires issuers to make and keep books, 
records, and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions 
and dispositions of the assets of the issuer.  Section 13(b)(2)(B) requires issuers to devise and 
maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in 
conformity with GAAP and to maintain the accountability of assets.  No showing of scienter is 
necessary to establish a violation of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) or 13(b)(2)(B).  See SEC v. McNulty, 
137 F.3d 732, 740-741 (2d Cir. 1998); SEC v. World-Wide Coin Investments, Ltd., 567 F. Supp. 
724, 749-51 (N.D. Ga. 1983).   
  
       Rule 13b2-1 of the Exchange Act prohibits any person from directly or indirectly 
falsifying, or causing to be falsified, any book, record or account subject to Section 13(b)(2)(A).  
Scienter is not an element of a violation of Rule 13b2-1.  McNulty, 137 F.3d at 740-741.   
 
       AremisSoft violated each of these provisions of the federal securities laws by, among 
other things, including false and misleading financial statements and information in its 2000 
report filed with the Commission and in registration statements that incorporated that report and 
financial information.   
        
       PKFs failure to comply with GAAS was a cause of      11
                                                                  AremisSofts violations.  
Likewise, Meads failure to comply with GAAS was a cause of AremisSofts violations.  PKF 
issued an audit report signed by Mead containing an unqualified opinion stating that PKF had 
conducted its audit of AremisSofts financial statements in accordance with GAAS, that 
AremisSofts financial statements were consistent with GAAP, and that AremisSofts reported 
results fairly represented its financial condition and results of operation.  Mead consented on 
behalf of PKF to the inclusion of this audit report in AremisSofts annual report on Form 10-K 
and in registration statements filed or in effect for that period.  However, the audit report was 
misleading because PKF and Mead failed to conduct the audit in accordance with GAAS.  PKF 
and Mead knew or should have known that AremisSofts reported financial results did not fairly 
present the companys financial condition or its results of operations.   
        

                                                 
11
   As described in this Order, the standard for liability as a cause of a violation under Section 21C of the 
Exchange Act is negligence.  See KMPG LLP v. SEC, 289 F.3d 109, 112 (D.C. Cir. 2002).  In this instance, PKF and 
Mead engaged in an act or omission that they knew or should have known would contribute to the primary violation.  
See Section 8A(a) of the Securities Act; Section 21C(a) of the Exchange Act. 

                                           - 15 - 
---------------------Page 16---------------------

       In auditing AremisSoft, PKF and Mead failed to exercise due professional care and 
skepticism, failed to obtain sufficient competent evidential matter, failed to properly plan or 
expand the procedures in the face of risk of material misstatement of the financial statements 
including risk due to fraudulent accounting. 
        
       Despite these accounting and auditing failures, and in further violation of GAAS, PKF 
did not issue a qualified or adverse audit report, or disclaim an ability to express any opinion at 
all, but instead issued an unqualified audit report signed by Mead on AremisSofts 2000 financial 
statements.  Accordingly, PKFs failure to comply with GAAS was a cause of AremisSofts 
violations of Section 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act and Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) 
and (B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-1 thereunder.  Likewise, 
Meads failure to comply with GAAS was a cause of AremisSofts violations of Section 17(a)(2) 
and (3) of the Securities Act and Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act 
and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-1 thereunder. 
        
       Section 10A of the Exchange Act requires each audit to include procedures designed to 
provide reasonable assurance of detecting illegal acts that would have a direct and material effect 
on the determination of financial statement amounts and if, in the course of conducting an audit, 
the auditor becomes aware of information indicating that an illegal act had or may have occurred, 
the auditor is required to investigate and notify management, the board of directors, or the audit 
committee.  No showing of scienter is necessary to establish a violation of Section 10A.  SEC v. 
Solucorp Industries, Ltd., 197 F. Supp. 2d 4 (S.D.N.Y. 2002).  Mead willfully violated Section 
10A(a) of the Exchange Act by failing to design appropriate audit procedures to determine 
whether or not senior management of AremisSoft had committed fraud.  PKF willfully      12
                                                                                           violated 
Section 10A of the Exchange Act because during its audit PKF became aware of information 
indicating that illegal acts had or may have occurred but did not bring that information to the 
attention of AremisSofts management, its board of directors, or its audit committee. 
        
E. FINDINGS 
        
       Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that: 
        
       1.           PKF willfully violated Section 10A of the Exchange Act and was a cause of 
AremisSofts violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act and Sections 13(a) and 
13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-1 thereunder; 
        
       2.           PKF engaged in improper professional conduct within the meaning of Rule 
102(e)(1)(ii) of the Commissions Rules of Practice in connection with PKFs 2000 audit of 
AremisSofts financial statements, which were included in AremisSofts annual report on Form 
10-K and in AremisSoft registration statements filed or in effect for that period; 
        
                                                 
12
   Willfully as used in this Order means intentionally committing the act that constitutes the violation. See 
Wonsover v. SEC, 205 F.3d 408, 414 (D.C. Cir. 2000); Tager v. SEC, 344 F.2d 5, 8 (2d Cir. 1965).  There is no 
requirement that the actor also be aware that he or she is violating one of the Rules or Acts.

---------------------Page 17---------------------

       3.           Mead willfully violated Section 10A(a) of the Exchange Act and was a cause of 
AremisSofts violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act and Sections 13(a) and 
13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-1 thereunder; 
        
       4.           Mead engaged in improper professional conduct within the meaning of Rule 
102(e)(1)(ii) of the Commissions Rules of Practice in connection with PKFs 2000 audit of 
AremisSofts financial statements, which were included in AremisSofts annual report on Form 
10-K and in AremisSoft registration statements filed or in effect for that period; 
        
       5.           Barnsdall engaged in improper professional conduct within the meaning of Rule 
102(e)(1)(ii) of the Commissions Rules of Practice in connection with PKFs 2000 audit of 
AremisSofts financial statements, which were included in AremisSofts annual report on Form 
10-K and in AremisSoft registration statements filed or in effect for that period. 

F.          UNDERTAKINGS BY PKF  

       PKF (and its successor PKF (UK) LLP, a limited liability partnership) undertakes and 
agrees that it will not accept any audit engagements for new Commission registrant audit clients 
for a period of one year from the date of the issuance of this Order.   
        
       PKF further undertakes to: 
          
           1.  enhance and provide training concerning the proper level of professional 
              skepticism of staff and partners concerning high risk clients;  
            
           2.  develop and implement enhanced audit procedures concerning the assessment and 
              identification of fraud risk indicators at the planning stage and throughout the 
              audit engagement; and 
            
           3.  require the involvement of a Quality Control and Compliance Partner in all audit 
              engagements of Commission registrants identified as high risk. 
 
In determining whether to accept PKFs Offer, the Commission has considered these 
undertakings. 
        
                                               IV. 
 
              In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in Respondents Offers. 
 
              Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act 
and Section 21C of the Exchange Act that: 
 
       A.         Respondent PKF shall cease and desist from committing any violations and any 
future violations of Section 10A of the Exchange Act; from committing or causing any violations 
and any future violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act; and from 

                                          - 17 - 
---------------------Page 18---------------------

causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) 
of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder.  
 
       B.          Respondent PKF is censured pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commissions Rules 
of Practice. 
        
       C.          Respondent Mead shall cease and desist from committing any violations and any 
future violations of Section 10A(a) of the Exchange Act; from committing or causing any 
violations and any future violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act; and 
from causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 
13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder. 
        
       D.         Respondent Mead is censured pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commissions Rules 
of Practice. 
 
       E.          It is also Ordered, pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commissions Rules of Practice 
that Respondent Mead is denied the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission 
as an accountant.  
        
       F.          Respondent Barnsdall is censured pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commissions 
Rules of Practice. 
 
       G.         It is also Ordered, pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commissions Rules of Practice 
that Respondent Barnsdall is denied the privilege of appearing or practicing before the 
Commission as an accountant. 
 
       H.         After two years from the date of this order, Respondent Barnsdall may request 
that the Commission consider his reinstatement by submitting an application (attention:  
Office of the Chief Accountant) to resume appearing or practicing before the Commission as: 
      
                            1.           a preparer or reviewer, or a person responsible for the preparation or 
review, of any public companys financial statements that are filed with the Commission.  Such 
an application must satisfy the Commission that Respondent Barnsdalls work in his practice 
before the Commission will be reviewed either by the independent audit committee of the public 
company for which he works or in some other acceptable manner, as long as he practices before 
the Commission in this capacity; and/or 
 
  2. an independent accountant.  Su                   ch an application must satisfy the 
Commission that: 
      
   (a) Respondent Barnsdall, or th                          e public accounting firm with which he 
is associated, is registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (Board) in 
accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and such registration continues to be effective; 
 
   (b) Respondent Barnsdall, or th                          e registered public accounting firm 
with which he is associated, has been inspected by the Board and that inspection did not identify 

                                           - 18 - 
---------------------Page 19---------------------

any criticisms of or potential defects in Respondents or the firms quality control system that 
would indicate that the Respondent will not receive appropriate supervision or, if the Board has 
not conducted an inspection, has received an unqualified report relating to his, or the firms, most 
recent peer review conducted in accordance with the guidelines adopted by the former SEC 
Practice Section of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Division for CPA 
Firms or an organization providing equivalent oversight and quality control functions; 

   (c) Respondent Barnsdall has resolv                                ed all disciplinary issues with the 
Board, and has complied with all terms and conditions of any sanctions imposed by the Board 
(other than reinstatement by the Commission); and 
 
   (d) Respondent Barnsdall acknowledge                                   s his responsibility, as long as 
Respondent appears or practices before the Commission as an independent accountant, to 
comply with all requirements of the Commission and the Board, including, but not limited to, all 
requirements relating to registration, inspections, concurring partner reviews and quality control 
standards. 
 
        I.           The Commission will consider an application by Barnsdall to resume appearing or 
practicing before the Commission provided that his practicing certificate is current and he has 
resolved all other disciplinary issues with the applicable United Kingdom Institute of Chartered 
Accountants.  However, if licensure is dependent on reinstatement by the Commission, the 
Commission will consider an application on its other merits.  The Commissions review may 
include consideration of, in addition to the matters referenced above, any other matters related to 
Barnsdalls character, integrity, professional conduct, or qualifications to appear of practice 
before the Commission. 
 
        By the Commission.
