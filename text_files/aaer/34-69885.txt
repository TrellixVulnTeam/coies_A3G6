        On September 27, 2011, the Commission instituted administrative and cease-and-desist 
proceedings against LPB Capital d/b/a Family Office Group, LLC, formerly registered with the 
Commission as an investment adviser, under Sections 203(e) and 203(k) of the Investment 
                       1
Advisers Act of 1940.      The Commission also instituted administrative and cease    -and -desist 
proceedings  against G ary J. Pappas , the firm's founder and former majority owner, chief 
executive officer, and chief compliance officer,   under Advisers Act Sections 203(f) and 203(k) 
                                                                  2
and Rule 102(e)(1)(iii) of the Commission's Rules of Practice.        The Order Instituting 
Proceed  ings alleges, among other things,  that  Family Office Group and Pappas     overstated the 
firm's assets under management and     violated antifraud provisions.

       Following the institution of proceedings, the Commission authorized the staff to accept a 
settlement offer pursuant to which the respondents agreed to: (i) a cease-and-desist order; (ii) the 
revocation of Family Office Group's registration with the Commission; (iii) a full collateral bar 
against Pappas from association with any investment adviser, broker, dealer, municipal securities 
dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization, 
with the right to reapply after five years; and (iv) a denial of Pappas's privilege of appearing or 
practicing before the Commission as an accountant with the right to reapply after five years.  
Based on Pappas's sworn financial declaration and supporting documentation and Family Office 
Group's status as a defunct entity with no assets, the settlement did not impose disgorgement or 
civil penalties. 
        
       Subsequently, Commission staff learned that Pappas had died in July 2012.  Before his 
death, Pappas and Family Office Group had submitted a Form ADV-W to withdraw and 
terminate the firm's investment adviser registration with the Commission.  The respondents also 
had submitted withdrawals terminating Family Office Group's investment adviser registration in 
two states. 
        
       On May 21, 2013, the Division of Enforcement filed a motion to dismiss the proceedings 
instituted against the respondents, stating that "[i]n light of Pappas'[s] demise and his estate 
having no assets to pay disgorgement or penalties, there is no further relief that can be obtained 
against him or his estate."  The Division also stated that "Family Office [Group] is a defunct 
entity that is non-operational, is not in good standing, has no assets, and has already withdrawn 
and terminated its Commission and state registrations."  Family Office Group has not responded 
to the Division's motion. 
        
       It is appropriate to grant the Division's motion in light of Pappas's death and Family 
Office Group's status. 
        
       Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that the proceedings against LPB Capital d/b/a Family 
Office Group, LLC and Gary J. Pappas be dismissed. 
        
       By the Commission.
