      The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) deems it appropriate and in the 
public interest that public administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, 
instituted pursuant to Section 15(b)(6) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act),

                                               II. 
 
       After an investigation, the Division of Enforcement alleges that: 
 
            A.        RESPONDENTS 
 
                            1.            Peak Wealth, a Florida limited liability company located in Largo, Florida, 
has been registered with the Commission as an investment adviser since October 2007.  From 
April 2008 to June 2010, Peak Wealth was the investment adviser to the StockCar Stocks Index 
Fund (the Fund), the sole series of the StockCar Stocks Mutual Fund, Inc. (the Company), 
formerly a registered investment company.  Peak Wealths basis for its registration with the 
Commission was its status as an investment adviser to an investment company registered under the 
Investment Company Act.  Peak Wealth is a wholly owned subsidiary of Peak Capital Corporation 
(Peak Capital), which also owns Peak Securities Corporation, a former broker-dealer (which 
withdrew its broker-dealer registration in March 2010), and a publishing and debt collection 
business. 
 
              2.      Dube, age 55, owns Peak Capital and its subsidiary businesses.  He is the 
president and sole managing member of Peak Wealth.  He was also the acting chief compliance 
officer of the Fund from October 2009 until June 2010.  Dube is a certified public accountant 
licensed in Florida and New Hampshire.  Dube registered with the Public Company Accounting 
Oversight Board in January 2010, indicating that he may conduct or play a substantial role in an 
audit in the future.  A recent public company filing in September 2011 indicates that Dube has 
been engaged to prepare the companys audited financial statements.  Other public filings from 
2001 and 2002 indicate that Dube has also served on at least two public company audit 
committees.  Dube has a disciplinary history with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority in 
connection with his formerly registered broker dealer.   
        
            B.        RELEVANT ENTITY 
            
               The Company, now defunct, was a Maryland corporation that operated as an open-
end diversified management investment company.  The Companys sole series     was the Fund.  The 
Company was registered with the Commission from September 1998 until March 2011, when it 
formally deregistered.     
 
            C.        BACKGROUND  
 
                     1. The Fund was an open-end management company that invest   ed in 
companies of the StockCar Stocks Index (the Index), the Funds proprietary index consisting of 

                                                                                                                                                       
The Commission may deny, temporarily or permanently, the privilege of appearing or practicing 
before it to any person who is foundto have willfully violated, or willfully aided and abetted 
the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or the rules and regulations 
thereunder. 

                                                2

approximately 40 companies that support NASCAR racing events.  The  Fund reported net assets of 
approximately $3.9 million in its most recently filed annual report for the fiscal year ended 
September 30, 2009.       
        
                     2. Peak Wealth became the investment adviser to the Fund in April 2008, 
pursuant to a vote by the majority of the Companys shareholders approving Peak Wealths written 
advisory agreement.  The advisory agreement was for an initial term of two years and was subject 
to the Fund boards annual review and approval thereafter.  Peak Wealth also served as the Funds 
administrator pursuant to a separate administration agreement.  The Fund was Peak Wealths only 
client.  
        
                     3. For its advisory services, Peak Wealth charged an annual fee of 0.65% of 
the Funds average daily net assets.  Peak Wealth contractually agreed to waive fees and/or 
reimburse the Fund for all expenses it incurred to the extent necessary to maintain the Funds total 
operating expenses at 1.5% of the Funds average daily net assets for a two-year period ending 
April 15, 2010.  Throughout the period of the reimbursement agreement, the expenses paid by the 
Fund, exclusive of advisory fees, exceeded the 1.5% cap.  Thus, due to the waiver agreement, Peak 
Wealth did not collect advisory fees while it served as adviser to the Fund.    
        
            D.         THE FUND BOARDS       TERMINATION OF PEAK WEALTHS 
                      ADVISORY CONTRACT 
 
                     1.  In late 2008, the Funds board began to raise concerns about Peak Wealths 
ability to meet its expense reimbursement obligation to the Fund.  Peak Wealth had failed to 
reimburse the Fund for expenses it owed under the advisory agreement, which resulted in the Fund 
delaying the filing of its annual report for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008.   
        
                     2.  By September 2009, the Fund had accumulated another receivable for 
expenses owed from Peak Wealth of approximately $50,000.  Dube repeatedly promised the board 
that he would repay the Fund, but he never did.  The Funds auditor refused to release its audit 
opinion without repayment of the outstanding obligation, resulting in the Fund delaying the filing 
of its 2009 annual report.  Ultimately, the board liquidated Dubes personal holdings in the Fund in 
order to satisfy the outstanding receivable.      
        
                     3.  The Funds portfolio manager, who worked for Peak Wealth and handled 
the trading activity and index rebalancing for the Fund, also encountered problems with Peak 
Wealth and Dube.  Dube failed to respond to multiple letters and emails from the portfolio 
manager throughout 2008 and 2009 regarding the Funds compliance obligations, the portfolio 
managers concerns about the regularity and substance of his communications with Peak Wealth 
and Dube, and his compensation.  The portfolio manager ultimately raised his concerns about the 
lack of communication with the Funds board in late 2009.   
        
                     4. In March 2010, prior to the conclusion of Peak Wealths initial two year 
investment advisory agreement with the Fund, the Funds board requested documents from Peak 
Wealth and Dube in connection with its first annual review of Peak Wealths investment advisory 

                                               3 
---------------------Page 4---------------------

contract under Section 15(c) of the Investment Company Act.  The board sent a second request in 
May 2010.  Peak Wealth requested an ex  tension of time to respond to the boards requests but 
failed to provide the board with any of the requested documents.   
        
                     5. In June 2010, the board terminated Peak Wealths advisory agreement, and 
voted to liquidate the Funds assets (approximately $4 million) and to deregister the Company.   
        
                     6. The Fund has distributed to investors all remaining assets net of liquidation 
expenses.  On March 23, 2011, the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated 
authority, issued an order terminating the Companys registration under the Investment Company 
Act.   
        
            E.        SEC EXAMINATION OF PEAK WEALTH 

                     1. In April 2010, SEC examination staff from the Miami Regional Office 
initiated an examination of Peak Wealth and the Fund.  The examination staff faxed its initial 
document request list to Peak Wealth and the Fund on April 7, 2010, one week before it 
commenced its examination.  When the staff arrived on April 14, Dube did not have any 
documents for Peak Wealth or the Fund.  Dube repeatedly assured examiners that responsive 
documents would be forthcoming. 

                     2.           The examination staff provided Peak Wealth with seven additional requests 
for documents.  These included requests for financial records relating to Peak Wealths advisory 
business including:  Peak Wealths balance sheet, trial balance, income statement, cash flow 
statements, and cash receipts and disbursements journals.   

                     3.  Dube and Peak Wealth did not produce these financial records because they 
did not exist.  Instead, Dube told examiners that he would create the requested financial records 
relating to Peak Wealth.   

                     4.  The examination staff also provided a document request to Dube (in his 
capacity as a representative of Peak Wealth and the Funds acting chief compliance officer) for 
documents relating to the maintenance of the Index, including the list of eligible issuers and proof 
of their eligibility, and records of daily value computations, the weighting of positions, the annual 
rebalancing process, and the correlation between the performance of the Fund and the Index.  

                     5.  At the conclusion of the field work, the majority of the requests for Peak 
Wealths financial records remained outstanding, as well as requests relating to the maintenance of 
the Index.  Examination staff referred the matter to the Division of Enforcement for further review.     
 
                     6. The Company, the Fund (through its board), and the former portfolio 
manager subsequently produced documents in response to a subpoena from the enforcement staff.  
However, Peak Wealth and Dube never responded to the staffs document subpoenas, and Dube 
failed to appear for investigative testimony pursuant to a subpoena.

          F.          PEAK WEALTHS FILINGS           
               
               Although the Fund terminated Peak Wealths advisory agreement in June 2010, 
Peak Wealth continues to be registered with the Commission.  Peak Wealth has not filed a Form 
ADV since September 2008.  Peak Wealths September 2008 Form ADV states that its basis for 
registration with the Commission is its status as an investment adviser to a registered investment 
company.  Peak Wealth has not filed a Form ADV-W or annually amended Forms ADV for its 
fiscal years ended September 30, 2009, 2010, and 2011.   
 
          G.          VIOLATIONS 
 
                            1. As a result of the conduct described above, Peak Wealth willfully violated 
Section 15(c) of the Investment Company Act which   requires, among other things, that the terms 
of any contract or agreement, whereby a person undertakes regularly to serve or act as investment 
adviser of a registered investment company, and any renewal thereof, be approved by a vote of the 
majority of a funds disinterested directors or trustees at a meeting called for the purpose of voting 
on such approval.  Section 15(c)  makes it the duty of an investment adviser of a registered 
investment company to furnish such information as may reasonably be necessary for fund directors 
to evaluate the terms of any contract whereby a person undertakes regularly to serve or act as 
investment adviser of such company. 2
                                        Peak Wealth  failed to provide the Funds board with 
information necessary for the board to evaluate the nature, quality, and cost of its services in 
connection with the boards first annual renewal of Peak Wealths advisory agreement.  Dube 
willfully aided and abetted and caused Peak Wealths violations of Section 15(c) of the Investment 
Company Act.   
 
                     2. As a result of the conduct described above, Peak Wealth willfully violated 
Section 204 of the Advisers Act and Rules 204-1(a)(1) and 204-2 (a)(1), (2), (4), (5), and (6) 
thereunder.  Section 204 of the Advisers Act requires investment advisers to make and keep certain 
records and furnish copies thereof, and to make and disseminate such reports as the Commission, 
by rule, may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of 
investors.  Section 204 specifies that all records of investment advisers are subject to examination 
by representatives of the Commission.  Rule 204-2 provides that investment advisers registered or 
required to be registered shall make and keep true, accurate and current copies of various specific 
categories of books and records, including:  

       •  A journal or journals, including cash receipts and disbursements, records, and any other 
           records of original entry forming the basis of entries in any ledger;

         See In the Matter of Morgan Stanley Investment Management, Inc., Advisers Act Release 
No. 3315 (Nov. 16, 2011)(charging adviser with 15(c) violations for failing to provide board with 
information relating to  sub-advisory services); In the Matter of New York Life Investment 
Management, LLC, Advisers Act Release No. 2883 (    May 27, 2009)(charging adviser with 15(c) 
violations for failing to provide board with information reasonably necessary to evaluate funds 
profitability) .

       •  General and auxiliary ledgers (or other comparable records) reflecting asset, liability, 
           reserve, capital, income and expense accounts; 
    
       •   All check books, bank statements, cancelled checks and cash reconciliations of the 
           investment adviser; 
            
       •  All bills or statements (or copies thereof), paid or unpaid, relating to the business of the 
           investment adviser as such; and 
            
       •  All trial balances, financial statements, and internal audit working papers relating to the 
           business of such investment adviser.   
        
Rule 204-1(a)(1) requires registered investment advisers to file with the Commission annual 
amended Forms ADV within 90 days of    their fiscal year end.  Peak Wealth fail ed to make, keep, 
and furnish true, accurate and current books and records.  Peak Wealth failed to make and keep 
financial statements, bank records, cash receipts or disbursement records, general or auxiliary 
ledgers, trial balances, or income and expense statements for its advisory business.  Peak Wealth 
offered to create certain financial statements for the examination staff, but only after the fact, and 
never actually produced them.  Peak Wealth also failed to furnish certain records to the 
examination and enforcement staff relating to the maintenance of the Index.  The enforcement staff 
was compelled to subpoena these  documents directly from a portfolio manager who worked for 
Peak Wealth.  Further, Peak Wealth failed to file annual amended Forms ADV for its fiscal years 
2009, 2010, and 2011.  Dube willfully aided and abetted and caused Peak Wealths violations of 
Section 204 of the Advisers Act and Rules 204-1(a)(1) and 204-2(a)(1), (2), (4), (5), and (6) 
thereunder.    
 
                     3.  As a result of the conduct described above, Peak Wealth willfully violated 
Section 203A of the Advisers Act and Rule 203A-1(b)(2) thereunder.  Section 203A  of the 
Advisers Act generally prohibits investment advisers with assets under management of less than 
$25 million from registering with the Commission, unless the adviser is an investment adviser to a 
registered investment company, or comes within one of the specified exemptions.3
                                                                                  Advisers Act 
Rule 203A-1(b)(2) requires a registered investment adviser who becomes ineligible for SEC 
registration to file Form ADV-W to withdraw its SEC registration within 180 days of its fiscal year 
end.  Peak Wealth failed to timely file a Form ADV-W after it became ineligible for SEC 
registration because the Fund terminated its advisory agreement on June 1, 2010.  Peak Wealth 
should have filed its Form ADV-W within 180 days of September 30, 2010, its 2010 fiscal year 
end.  Dube willfully aided and abetted and caused Peak Wealths violations of Section 203A of the 
Advisers Act and Rule 203A-1(b)(2) thereunder.    
 
                                                 
3
 Effective July 21, 2011, Section 203A generally prohibits an adviser that has assets under 
management between $25 million and $100 million from registering with the Commission, 
unless it is an investment adviser to a registered investment company, or it comes within one of 
the specified exemptions.  See  Advisers Act Section 203A(a)(2) (amended by the Dodd-Frank 
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010));

Advisers Act Release No. 3221 (June 22, 2011).

              In view of the allegations made by the Division of Enforcement, the Commission 
deems it necessary and appropriate in the public interest that public administrative and cease-and-
desist proceedings be instituted to determine: 
        
       A.     Whether the allegations set forth in Section II hereof are true and, in connection 
therewith, to afford Respondents an opportunity to establish any defenses to such allegations;  
        
       B.     What, if any, remedial action is appropriate in the public interest against 
Respondents pursuant to Sections 203(e) and 203(f) of the Advisers Act including, but not limited 
to, civil penalties pursuant to Section 203 of the Advisers Act;  
        
       D.     What, if any, remedial action is appropriate in the public interest against 
Respondents pursuant to Section 9(b) of the Investment Company Act including, but not limited to, 
civil penalties pursuant to Section 9 of the Investment Company Act;  
        
       E.     What, if any, remedial action is appropriate in the public interest against 
Respondents pursuant to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act;  
        
       F.     What, if any, remedial action is appropriate in the public interest against Dube 
pursuant to Rule 102(e)(1)(iii) of the Commissions Rules of Practice; and  
        
       G.     Whether, pursuant to Section 203(k) of the Advisers Act, and Section 9(f) of the 
Investment Company Act, Respondents    should be ordered to cease and desist from committing or 
causing violations of and any future violations of Sections 203A and 204 of the Advisers Act and 
Rules 203A-1(b)(2), 204-1(a)(1), 204-2(a)(1), (2), (4), (5) and (6) thereunder, and Section 15(c) of 
the Investment Company Act, and whether Respondents should be ordered to pay civil penalties 
pursuant to Section 203(i) of the Advisers Act, and Section 9(d) of the Investment Company Act.   
 
                                              IV. 
        
       IT IS ORDERED that a public hearing for the purpose of taking evidence on the questions 
set forth in Section III hereof shall be convened not earlier than 30 days and not later than 60 days 
from service of this Order at a time and place to be fixed, and before an Administrative Law Judge 
to be designated by further order as provided by Rule 110 of the Commission's Rules of Practice, 17

       IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondents shall file an Answer to the allegations 
contained in this Order within twenty (20) days after service of this Order, as provided by Rule 220 
of the Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.220.  
        
       If Respondents fails to file the directed answer, or fails to appear at a hearing after being 
duly notified, the Respondents may be deemed in default and the proceedings may be determined 
against them upon consideration of this Order, the allegations of which may be deemed to be true as
