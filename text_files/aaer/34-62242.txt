                                               I.  
 
       The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the 
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against 
Anthony Bonica (“Respondent” or “Bonica”) pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(i) of the Commission’s 
Rules of Practice.1 
                    

                                                 
1
 Rule 102(e)(3)(i) provides, in relevant part, that: 
 
       The Commission, with due regard to the public interest and without preliminary hearing, 
may, by order . . . suspend from appearing or practicing before it any . . . accountant . . . who has 
been by name . . . permanently enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction, by reason of his 
or her misconduct in an action brought by the Commission, from violating or aiding and abetting 
the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or of the rules and regulations 
thereunder.

                                              II.  
 
       In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the 
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings 
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these 
proceedings, and the findings contained in Section III.3  below, which are admitted, Respondent  
consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Rule 102(e) 
of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions 
(“Order”), as set forth below.   
 
                                              III.  
 
       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that: 
  
              1.     Bonica, age 60, passed the CPA exam in 1978 in New York State and is a 
certified public accountant.  He joined Monster, Inc. in April 1994, and was the controller until mid-
2001, when he became the vice president for investor relations  and financial planning.  Bonica was 
terminated in December 2006. 
        
              2.     Monster Worldwide, Inc. (“Monster”), formerly known as TMP 
Worldwide Inc.,  is a Delaware corporation that is the parent company of Monster.com, a leading 
global online career and recruitment resource.  Headquartered in New York, New York, Monster 
employs approximately 4,600 employees in 35 countries.  Monster’s common stock is currently 
registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(“Exchange Act”) and trades on the NASDAQ National Market System under the symbol 
“MNST.”   Monster’s initial public offering of shares of its common stock occurred on December  
12, 1996.  
 
              3.      On April 30, 2008, the Commission filed a complaint against Bonica in SEC  
v. James Treacy and Anthony Bonica, 08 CV 4052 (S.D.N.Y.).   On May 28, 2010, the court 
entered an order permanently restraining and enjoining Bonica from direct or indirect violations of 
Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)], Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the 
Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b) and 78m(b)(5)] and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 [17 C.F.R. §§ 
240.10b-5 and 240.13b2-1] thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a) , 
13(b)(2)(A) and 14(a) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78m(a) , 78m(b)(2)(A) and 78n(a)], and 
Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13 and 14a-9 [17 C.F.R. §§ 240.12b-20, 240.13a-1, 240.13a-11, 
and 240.13a-13 and 240.14a-9] thereunder.  Bonica was also ordered to  pay a $60,000 civil money 
penalty, $115,736.71 of disgorgement and $33,800.89 in prejudgment interest. 
        
              4.      The Commission’s complaint alleged, among other things, that Bonica  
participated in a fraudulent stock option backdating scheme; that Bonica’s fraudulent conduct 
caused Monster’s periodic filings and proxy statements to falsely portray Monster’s options as 
having been granted at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of Monster’s common stock 

                                               2
  
---------------------Page 3---------------------

on the date of the grant, when, in fact, Monster was granting in-the-money options; and that Bonica  
understood the accounting consequences of granting in-the-money options but did nothing to 
ensure that Monster properly accounted for these options in its financial statements.  Bonica’s 
conduct caused Monster to file materially false and misleading public reports that contained 
financial statements that materially understated its compensation expenses and materially 
overstated its quarterly and annual net income.  On December 13, 2006, Monster restated its 
historical financial results for 1997-2005 in a cumulative pre-tax amount of approximately $339.5 
million to record additional non-cash charges for option related compensation.  The complaint  
further alleged that Bonica benefited from the scheme, including the receipt and exercise of  
backdated grants of in-the-money options.      
        
                                                IV. 
                                                  
        In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
impose the sanction agreed to in Respondent Bonica’s Offer. 
 
        Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that:  
 
       A.      Bonica is suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an 
accountant.   
 
       B.      After three years from the date of this order, Respondent may request that the 
Commission consider his reinstatement by submitting an application (attention: Office of the  
Chief Accountant) to resume appearing or practicing before the Commission as: 
      
                                1. a preparer or reviewer, or a person responsible for the preparation or 
review, of any public company’s financial statements that are filed with the Commission.  Such 
an application must satisfy the Commission that Respondent’s work in his practice before the 
Commission will be reviewed either by the independent audit committee of the public company 
for which he works or in some other acceptable manner, as long as he practices before the 
Commission in this capacity; and/or  
      
               2.     an independent accountant.  Such an application must satisfy the 
Commission that: 
      
                            (a) Respondent, or the public accounting firm with which he is 
associated, is registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight    Board (“Board”) in 
accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and such registration continues to be effective; 
 
                      (b)     Respondent, or the registered  public accounting firm with which he 
is associated, has been inspected by the Board and that inspection did not identify any criticisms  
of or potential defects in the Respondent’s or the firm’s quality control system that would 
indicate that the Respondent will not receive appropriate supervision;  

                                                 3
  
---------------------Page 4---------------------

                  (c)              Respondent has resolved all di       sciplinary issues with the Board, and 
has complied with all terms and conditions of any sanctions imposed by the Board (other than 
reinstatement by the Commission); and 
 
                          (d)      Respondent acknowledges          his responsibility, as long as 
Respondent appears or practices before the Commission as an independent accountant, to 
comply with all requirements of the Commission and the Board, including, but not limited to, all 
requirements relating to registration, inspections, concurring partner reviews and quality control 
standards. 
      
        C.       The Commission will consider an application by Respondent to resume  
appearing or practicing before the Commission provided that his state CPA license is 
current and he has resolved all other disciplinary issues with the applicable state boards of 
accountancy.  However, if state licensure is dependent on reinstatement by the 
Commission, the Commission will consider an application on its other merits.  The 
Commission’s review may include consideration of, in addition to the matters referenced 
above, any other matters relating to Respondent’s character, integrity, professional conduct, 
or qualifications to appear or practice before the Commission. 
 
  By the Commission.
