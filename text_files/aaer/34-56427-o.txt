                                           I. 

      The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate that public 
administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 4C of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice 
against Banker & Co. (“Banker & Co.”) and Jitendra S. Banker (“Banker”) (collectively 
“Respondents”). 

                                          II. 

      After an investigation, the Division of Enforcement alleges that: 

A.    RESPONDENTS 

      1.     Banker & Co. is a California corporation and public accounting firm 
headquartered in Costa Mesa, California.  Banker & Co. prepared and issued an audit report dated

      2.     Jitendra S. Banker, 67, of Costa Mesa, California, has been licensed as a chartered 
accountant in England since 1969, but he is not licensed as a CPA in any American state.  As 
engagement partner on the OTC Dreamwerks, Morgan, and Mill Creek engagements, Banker 
participated in the preparation and issuance of the January 31, 2004 OTC Dreamwerks audit report, 
the May 21, 2004 Morgan Clark audit report, and the August 10, 2004 Mill Creek audit report.

D. VIO     LATIONS 

       1.     Section 4C(a) of the Exchange Act provides, in relevant part, that the Commission 
“may censure any person, or deny, temporarily or permanently, to any person the privilege of 
appearing or practicing before the Commission in any way, if that person is found by the 
Commission … (1) not to possess the requisite qualifications to represent others … or (3) to have 
willfully violated, or willfully aided and abetted the violation of, any provision of the securities 
laws or the rules and regulations issued thereunder.” 

       2.     Rule 102(e)(1) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice provides that the 
Commission “may censure a person or deny, temporarily or permanently, the privilege of 
appearing or practicing before it in any way to any person who is found by the Commission ... (i) 
not to possess the requisite qualifications to represent others … or (iii) to have willfully violated … 
any provision of the Federal securities laws or the rules and regulations thereunder.” 

                                               3

       3.     Section 102(a) of the Act provides that “it shall be unlawful for any person that is 
not a registered public accounting firm to prepare or issue, or to participate in the preparation or 
issuance of, any audit report with respect to any issuer.” 

       4.     Because Banker & Co. had not registered with the PCAOB, it lacked “the requisite 
qualifications” to issue audit reports dated January 31, 2004, May 21, 2004, and August 10, 2004. 

       5.     By participating in the preparation and issuance of audit reports after October 22, 
2003 by an audit firm that was not registered with the PCAOB, Banker lacked “the requisite 
qualifications to represent others.” 

       6.     In violation of Section 102(a) of the Act, Banker & Co. prepared and issued audit 
reports on the financial statements of reporting companies after October 22, 2003 without first 
registering with the Board. Banker & Co. thus also willfully violated the federal securities laws. 

                                              III. 

       In view of the allegations made by the Division of Enforcement, the Commission deems it 
necessary and appropriate that public administrative proceedings be instituted to determine:    

       A.     Whether the allegations set forth in Section II are true and, in connection therewith, 
to afford Respondents an opportunity to establish any defenses to such allegations;  

       B.     Whether, pursuant to Sections 4C(a)(1) and 4C(a)(3) of the Exchange Act, and 
Rules 102(e)(1)(i)  and 102(e)(1)(iii) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Banker & Co. should 
be censured by the Commission or temporarily or permanently denied the privilege of appearing or 
practicing before the Commission; and  

       C.     Whether, pursuant to Section 4C(a)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rule 102(e)(1)(i) of 
the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Banker should be censured by the Commission or temporarily 
or permanently denied the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission.  

                                              IV. 

       IT IS ORDERED that a public hearing for the purpose of taking evidence on the questions 
set forth in Section III hereof shall be convened at a time and place to be fixed, and before an 
Administrative Law Judge to be designated by further order as provided by Rule 110 of the 
Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.110.   

       IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondents shall file an Answer to the allegations 
contained in this Order within twenty (20) days after service of this Order, as provided by Rule 220 
of the Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.220.  

       If Respondents fail to file the directed answer, or fail to appear at a hearing after being duly 
notified, the Respondents may be deemed in default and the proceedings may be determined against 

                                                4

them upon consideration of this Order, the allegations of which may be deemed to be true as 
provided by Rules 155(a), 220(f), 221(f) and 310 of the Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R.  
§§ 201.155(a), 201.220(f), 201.221(f) and 201.310. 

       This Order shall be served forthwith upon Respondents personally or by certified mail. 

       IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Administrative Law Judge shall issue an initial 
decision no later than 300 days from the date of service of this Order, pursuant to Rule 360(a)(2) of 
the Commission’s Rules of Practice. 

       In the absence of an appropriate waiver, no officer or employee of the Commission engaged 
in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions in this or any factually related 
proceeding will be permitted to participate or advise in the decision of this matter, except as witness 
or counsel in proceedings held pursuant to notice.  Since this proceeding is not “rule making” within 
the meaning of Section 551 of the Administrative Procedure Act, it is not deemed subject to the 
provisions of Section 553 delaying the effective date of any final Commission action. 

 By       the Commission.
