   A.   SUMMARY  
            
               1.       From year-end 2004 through the first quarter of 2008, Powder River 
Petroleum International, Inc. (“Powder River”) improperly accounted for over $43 million in 
proceeds from conveyances of fractional working interests in oil-and-gas leases to investors in 
Asia.  In particular, Powder River immediately recognized revenue from the conveyances, despite 
the fact that it had promised the Asian working interest investors a guaranteed return until they 
recouped their initial investment.  In addition, Powder River also improperly recorded assets it did 
not own or that were stated in excess of net realizable value.  As a result, Powder River’s financial 
statements did not present fairly, in all material respects, the company’s financial position, 
operating results, and cash flows in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  
Powder River materially overstated its revenues by 7% to 2,417%, its pre-tax income by 18% to 
441%, and its assets by 7% to 48% in its Commission filings during the applicable period.   
                
               2.       Respondents incorrectly advised Powder River on how it should record 
financial items, including revenue from the working-interest conveyances from 2005 through 
August 2007.  After August 2007, Johnson, as CFO, and Hanni, assisting Johnson as a de facto co-
CFO, supervised and directed the company’s improper recording of its assets and its revenue from 
the working-interest conveyances.  By mid-2007, Powder River used proceeds from current 

                                                                                                                                                             
 
       The Commission may . . . deny, temporarily or permanently, the privilege of appearing or practicing before  
it . . . to any person who is found…to have willfully viol            ated, or willfully aided and abetted the violation of any  
provision of the Federal securities laws or the rules and regulations thereunder.

       The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondents’ Offer of Settlement and are not binding on any    
other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

working interest conveyances to pay the guaranteed returns to earlier Asian investors.  In mid-
March 2008, Johnson authorized one of those payments, but failed to disclose in Powder River’s  
first quarter 2008 Form 10-Q that the company was using later investor funds to pay earlier 
investors. 
            
   B.   RESPONDENTS  
            
              3.      Jeffery Q. Johnson is a certified public accountant licensed in the state of 
Utah and was employed at Stayner Bates & Jensen, PC (“Stayner Bates”) from January 2006 until 
November 2010.  Johnson provided bookkeeping, financial reporting, and other accounting 
services to Powder River from June 2006 until August 2007, when he contracted with Powder 
River to serve as Powder River’s CFO on a part-time basis.  Johnson resigned as Powder River’s  
CFO in September 2008.  While CFO, Johnson remained employed at Stayner Bates. 
               
              4.      Steven M. Hanni is a certified public accountant licensed in the state of 
Utah and served as the engagement partner on Stayner Bates's engagement to provide 
bookkeeping, financial reporting, and other accounting services to Powder River from 2004 to  
August 2007.  Pursuant to Johnson and Powder River’s arrangement with NJS Management, LLC, 
Hanni assisted Johnson with his duties as Powder River’s CFO.   
            
   C.   RELEVANT ENTITIES 
            
              5.      Powder River Petroleum International, Inc.                        is an Oklahoma corporation 
headquartered in Calgary, Canada.  The company’s common stock is registered with the  
Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g).  Powder River’s shares are currently quoted  
on Pink OTC Markets, Inc.  In  July 2008, an Oklahoma district court granted a temporary 
restraining order and appointed a receiver for Powder River in connection with a complaint filed 
by certain Asian investors.4
                            In December 2008, Powder River filed for bankruptcy.5
                                                                                   It has not 
restated its financial statements, other than a restatement of its 2007 quarterly financial statements  
included in its year-end 2007 financial statements, nor has it filed any reports with the Commission 
since September 17, 2008  
               
              6.      Stayner Bates & Jensen, PC, a CPA firm located in Salt Lake City, Utah, 
became registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) in 2009, 
and has no public company audit clients.  From 2004 through August 2007, Powder River engaged 
Stayner Bates to provide bookkeeping, financial reporting, and other accounting services.  
        
              7.      NJS Management, LLC (“NJS”), a Utah limited liability company, was 
formed by Johnson, Hanni, and another Stayner Bates partner to provide CFO services.  Powder 
River had an agreement with Johnson through which Powder River paid NJS the money 
representing Johnson’s salary from Powder River.  That money was then split amongst Johnson,

   D.   FACTS 
 
       Oil-and-Gas Working Interest Conveyances  
 
              8.      From year-end 2004 through the first quarter of 2008, Powder River offered 
and sold working interests in its oil-and-gas leases through an independent sales agent to investors 
in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.  Powder River’s contracts with Asian investors provided 
that they would receive guaranteed payments yielding an annual minimum of 9%, and in some  
cases more, beginning approximately six months after the date of investment until investors 
reached the “break-even” point, i.e. when their principal had been repaid (the “guaranteed 
payments”).  Thereafter, investors received lease production payments based on their respective 
working interests.  By the second quarter of 2007, Powder River’s guaranteed payments exceeded 
not only the investors’ share of oil-and-gas production revenues, but also Powder River’s total 
production revenues.  After that date, Powder River used proceeds from working interest  
conveyances to new investors to fund guaranteed payments to earlier investors.  
               
              9.      From year-end 2004 through the first quarter of 2008, Powder River 
improperly recognized as revenue over $33.5 million in proceeds from conveyances of the working 
interests to investors.  These conveyances were in substance and should have been reported by 
Powder River as borrowings, not revenue (see Financial Accounting Standards No. 19, Financial 
Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies, paragraph 43).  The investors’ 
contractual right to receive guaranteed payments until their “break-even point” represented, in 
substance, a loan of capital to Powder River at a guaranteed 9% minimum rate of return.  As a 
result of Powder River’s improper accounting, the  company materially overstated its revenues in 
its Forms 10-QSB, 10-Q, 10-KSB and 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004 through the 
quarter ended March 31, 2008 by 7% to 2,417% and its net pre-tax income by 18% to 441%.   
               
              10.     Beginning in 2005, Powder River hired Stayner Bates to provide 
bookkeeping, reporting and other accounting services.  Hanni was the partner and oversaw the 
firm’s engagement from 2005 through August 2007.  Johnson joined Stayner Bates in January 2006 
and began assisting Hanni on the Powder River engagement in June 2006.  In connection with this 
engagement, Hanni and Johnson provided accounting and reporting advice with respect to 
acquisitions and conveyances of oil-and-gas interests and drafted Powder River’s financial 
statements for inclusion in Powder River’s SEC filings.  Respondents advised the company 
regarding the appropriate accounting for the working-interest-conveyance proceeds without 
reviewing underlying documents, which reflected the guaranteed payments to investors.  Instead, 
Respondents relied, without further  inquiry, on Powder River management’s representations and 
characterization of the working interest conveyances as “sales.”  As a result, Powder River: a) 
failed to disclose and account properly for the guaranteed payments; and b) improperly reported 

                                               4
  
---------------------Page 5---------------------

 
the working interest conveyance proceeds as revenue in financial statements included in its Forms  
10-K and Forms 10-Q for year-end 2005 through the second quarter of 2007.                            
               
              11.     During the preparation of Powder River’s financial statements for the year 
ended December 31, 2006, Respondents became aware of Powder River’s 9% payments to the  
working interest investors.  Yet, Hanni failed to analyze the significance of those payments and 
erroneously advised Powder River to net them against oil-and-gas production revenues.  As a 
result, Powder River continued to record the working interest conveyance proceeds as revenue, 
failed to disclose the guaranteed payments, and improperly offset the guaranteed payments against  
the company’s oil-and-gas production receipts in its 2006 Form 10-KSB and first quarter 2007 
Form 10-QSB.  
        
              12.     In the second quarter of 2007, when the guaranteed payments exceeded the  
company’s total oil-and-gas receipts, Respondents  erroneously advised the company to record the  
guaranteed payments on the company’s balance sheet as an asset labeled as “pre-paid production 
payments.”  As a result, Powder River continued to record the working interest conveyance 
proceeds as revenue, failed to disclose the guaranteed payments, and mischaracterized those 
payments as an asset in its financial statements included in its second quarter 2007 Form 10- QSB.   
 
              13.     In August 2007, Powder River named Johnson as Powder River’s CFO and 
began paying NJS for his and Hanni’s CFO services.  It was understood between Powder River and 
NJS that Respondents would function together as Powder River’s CFO, yet they failed to assess 
Powder River’s revenue recognition policy for working interest conveyances and the appropriate 
accounting and reporting of the conveyances and related guaranteed payments to investors.  As a 
result, Powder River continued to record the working interest conveyance proceeds as revenue in 
its financial statements filed in its third-quarter 2007 Form 10-QSB and first-quarter 2008 Form  
10-Q, and in its 2007 Form 10-K.  
        
              14.     While preparing for the audit of Powder River’s 2007 financial statements, 
Respondents concluded that Powder River had improperly reported the guaranteed payments as an 
asset on Powder River’s balance sheet in its second and third-quarter 2007 financial statements.   
As a result, on March 17, 2008, Powder River filed a Form 8-K in which it first publicly disclosed 
the guaranteed payments and indicated that the company’s second and third quarter 2007 financial 
statements could not be relied upon.  Respondents  did not, however, change the company’s 
recognition of revenue from the working interest conveyances in its year-end 2007 financial 
statements.  Instead, in its 2007 Form 10-K, the company simply disclosed the guaranteed  
payments and identified them as a future commitment in a footnote to the year-end 2007 financial 
statements.  As a result, Powder River continued to materially overstate its revenues and pre-tax 
income in financial statements included in its 2007 Form 10-K and its first quarter 2008 Form 10-
Q.  Johnson, as Powder River’s principal accounting officer, certified Powder River’s 2007 Form  
10-K financial statements.  
        
              15.     In early March 2008, Johnson authorized Powder River’s independent sales 
agent to use new working interest investor funds the agent had collected to make guaranteed 

                                               5
  
---------------------Page 6---------------------

 
payments to previous investors.  Johnson subsequently supervised the preparation of financial 
statements for Powder River’s first quarter 2008 Form 10-Q, which he certified as company 
principal accounting officer.  In this filing and Powder River’s March 17, 2008 Form 8-K, the 
company failed to disclose that the company was using proceeds from current working interest 
conveyances to fund guaranteed payments to earlier investors.  Johnson failed to disclose to 
Powder River’s auditor that he had authorized guaranteed payments to existing investors from new 
investors’ funds.  
        
 Inflated Assets       
        
               16.     Powder River reported assets that it did not own, that did not exist, or that it  
should have written in financial statements included in its 2005, 2006 and 2007 Forms 10-KSB and 
10-K and for its Forms 10-QSB and 10-Q for the first, second and third quarters of 2005, 2006, and 
2007 and the first quarter of 2008, thereby inflating its assets between 37% and 48%.  After 
Johnson became CFO, he and Hanni failed to devise and maintain a system of accounting controls 
to validate the existence of the assets reported on the company’s balance sheet, evaluate reported 
assets for potential impairment, or to ensure that Powder River’s financial statements were 
prepared  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  Accordingly, Hanni and 
Johnson were a cause of the misstatements  in Powder River’s financial statements.  
                  
               17.     In particular, Powder River improperly included as assets on its financial 
statements two oil-and-gas leases it had agreed, but failed, to acquire.  Specifically, in 2005, 
Powder River made $500,000 in nonrefundable payments as a part of an agreement to acquire a 
New Mexico oil-and-gas lease for $5 million, but by August 2005 it had defaulted on the terms of 
the agreement and lost its rights to the lease.  Nonetheless, Powder River continued to report the  
lease as an asset on its balance sheet from the third quarter of 2005 through the first quarter of 
2008, which was its last quarterly report.  Similarly, Powder River made nonrefundable payments 
totaling $1.5 million in late 2006 and early 2007 as part of an agreement to acquire a Texas oil-
and-gas lease for $6.5 million.  The company reported the lease, along with an associated note  
payable, as assets on its balance sheet from year-end 2006 onward.  In reality, the agreement was 
never consummated, no note agreement was ever executed, and by the end of 2007 Powder River  
had forfeited its payments. Without verifying the CEO’s characterization of these transactions, 
Johnson and Hanni allowed Powder River to report the leases as assets on its balance sheet.  
                
               18.     In addition, Powder River listed a $1.2 million item as a “loan receivable” 
on the company’s balance sheet in its 2007 Form 10-K financial stat ements.  In prior periods, this 
item was reported as a cash or cash equivalent.  In its financial statements included in its 2007 
Form 10-K, Powder River reclassified a $1.2 item from “cash,” where it had been improperly 
classified since year-end 2006, to “loan receivable” on its balance sheet.  This item represented a  
loan receivable from a related party, yet had not been previously disclosed as required by 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 57, Related Party Disclosures.  Although the loan  
was uncollectible and the company never received any loan payments, Respondents failed to 
evaluate the collectability of the loan receivable at year end 2007, thereby causing the company to 
overstate its assets in financial statements included in its 2007 Form10-K.

   E.   VIOLATIONS   
 
               19.     Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder prohibit a 
person, in connection with the purchase or sale of a security, from making an untrue statement of a 
material fact or from omitting to state a material fact necessary to make statements made, in light 
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.  To violate Section 10(b) or 
Rule 10b-5, a defendant must act with  scienter, Aaron v. SEC, 446 U.S. 680, 695, 701-02 (1980), 
which the Supreme Court has defined as "a mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, 
or defraud," Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185, 193 n.12 (1976).  Scienter may be 
established by showing that the respondents acted intentionally or with severe recklessness.                                                  See, 
e.g., Broad v. Rockwell Int’l Corp., 642 F.2d 929, 961-62 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 965 
(1981).  During March 2008, Johnson authorized guaranteed payments to existing investors from 
new investor funds.  He failed, however, to disclose those payments in the first quarter 2008 Form  
10-Q, which he signed and certified.  As a result of his severely reckless conduct, Johnson willfully 
violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  6 
                                                                          
                
               20.     Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, and 
12b-20 thereunder, require every issuer of a security registered pursuant to Section 12 of the   
Exchange Act to file with the Commission information, documents, and annual and quarterly 
reports as the Commission may require, and mandate that periodic reports contain such further 
material information as may be necessary to make the required statements not misleading.  The  
obligation to file such reports embodies the requirement that they be true and correct.  See, e.g., 
SEC v. Savoy Indus., Inc., 587 F.2d 1149, 1165 (D.C. Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 913 
(1979).  As discussed above, Johnson caused Powder River’s false and misleading quarterly and 
annual Commission reports for third-quarter 2007, year-end 2007, and first-quarter 2008.   Hanni  
caused Powder River’s false and misleading quarterly and annual Commission reports from year-
end 2005 through the first quarter of 2008.  Johnson caused Powder River’s  false and misleading 
Form 8-K dated March 17, 2008.  Accordingly, Johnson and Hanni willfully aided and abetted and 
caused Powder River’s violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1, 13a-13, 
and 12b-20 thereunder, and Johnson willfully aided and abetted and caused Powder River’s 
violations of Rule 13a-11.  
                
               21.     Rule 13a-14 promulgated under the Exchange Act requires an issuer’s 
principal executive and financial officer to certify in each quarterly and annual report filed or 
submitted by the issuer under Exchange Act Section 13(a), that: (1) they have reviewed the report; 
and (2) based on their knowledge, the report does not contain any untrue statement of material fact, 
or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the st atements made, in light of the 
circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period 
covered by the report.  As discussed above, Johnson certified Powder River’s periodic reports from 
                                                 
6 
       A willful violation of the securities laws means merely                    “‘that the person charged with the duty knows what  
he is doing.’” Wonsover v. SEC, 205 F.3d 408, 414 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (quoting                Hughes v. SEC, 174 F.2d 969, 977          
(D.C. Cir. 1949)).  “Willfulness” does not require that the actor “‘also be aware that he is violating one of the Rules   
or Acts.’” Id. (quoting  Gearhart & Otis, Inc. v. SEC, 348 F.2d 798, 803 (D.C. Cir. 1965)).  
                                                 7

the third quarter of 2007 through the first quarter of 2008, which misstated Powder River’s 
revenue, net income and assets, and omitted to state that Powder River was using new investor 
proceeds to pay previous investors. Accordingly, Johnson willfully violated Exchange Act Rule  
13a-14.  
        
              22.     Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act requires Section 12 registrants to 
make and keep books, records, and accounts that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and 
dispositions of their assets.  As described above, Respondents’ conduct from the third quarter of 
2007 through the first quarter of 2008 was a cause of Powder River’s improper recording of 
transactions in its books and records.  Accordingly, Johnson and Hanni willfully aided and abetted 
and caused Powder River’s violations of Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act.   
        
              23.     Section 13(b)(2)(B) requires all reporting companies to devise and maintain  
a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that  
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles.  As discussed above, after August 2007, 
Respondents were responsible for Powder River’s  failure to devise and maintain a system of 
internal accounting controls to properly record the company’s financial information, including its 
assets.  As a result, Respondents willfully aided and abetted and caused Powder River’s violations  
of Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act.  
        
              24.     Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act provides that no person shall 
knowingly falsify any such book, record, or account or circumvent internal controls.  Rule 13b2-1 
also prohibits the falsification of any book, record, or account subject to Section 13(b)(2)(A).  Rule 
13b2-2(a) prohibits an officer or director of an issuer from, directly or indirectly: (1) making, or 
causing to be made, a materially false or misleading statement; or (2) omitting, or causing to be 
omitted, a statement of a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the 
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading to an accountant in connection with a  
required audit, or the preparation or filing of a required document or report.  As discussed above, 
Johnson authorized payments to existing investors from new investor funds that he failed to 
properly record or disclose to auditors or in Powder River’s first quarter of 2008 Form 10-Q.  
Therefore, Johnson willfully violated Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13b2-1 and 
13b2-2 thereunder.   
               
   F.   FINDINGS  
 
              25.     Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that:  
        
                  a.   Johnson willfully violated Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act 
and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 promulgated thereunder, and willfully aided and 
abetted and caused Powder River’s violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the  
Exchange Act, and Rules 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, and 12b-20 promulgated thereunder;  
                   

                                                8
  
---------------------Page 9---------------------

 
                  b.   Hanni willfully aided and abetted and caused Powder River’s violations of 
Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 13a-1, 13a-13, and 
12b-20 promulgated thereunder; and  
                   
                  c.   Johnson willfully violated Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act 
and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 promulgated thereunder, and he and Hanni willfully 
aided and abetted Powder River’s violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the 
Exchange Act, and Rules 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, and 12b-20 promulgated thereunder, within the 
meaning of Exchange Act Section 4C and Rule 102(e)(1)(iii) of the Commission’s Rules of 
Practice. 
                       
        
   G.   UNDERTAKINGS 
 
              26.     Cooperation. Respondents undertake to cooperate fully with the 
Commission with respect to any matter relating to the Commission's investigation of Powder 
River or its current or former officers, directors, employees, or auditors, including but not limited 
to any litigation or other proceeding related to or resulting from that investigation.  Such 
cooperation shall include, but is not limited to, upon reasonable notice, and without subpoena:  

                  a.   Producing any document, record, or other tangible evidence reasonably 
requested by Commission staff in connection with the Commission's investigation, litigation or 
other proceedings; 

                  b.   Providing all information reasonably requested by Commission staff in 
connection with the Commission's investigation; and  

                  c.   Attending and providing truthful statements at any meeting, interview, 
testimony, deposition, trial, or other legal proceeding reasonably requested by the Commission 
staff.  

               27.    In determining whether to accept the Offer, the Commission has 
considered these undertakings. 
 
                                              IV. 
                                                 
       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in Respondents’ Offer. 
 
       Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that: 
 
   A.   JOHNSON 
 
           Johnson shall cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future 
   violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act 
                                               9
  
---------------------Page 10---------------------

 
   and Rules 10b-5, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, 12b-20, 13a-14, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 promulgated 
   thereunder.  
            
           Pursuant to Section 21C(f) of the Exchange  Act, Johnson is prohibited, for a period of 
   five years from the date of this Order, from acting as an officer or director of any issuer that has  
   a class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of  the Exchange Act, or that is required to 
   file reports pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act.    
        
           Johnson is denied the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission as an 
accountant. 
            
           After five years from the date of this Order, Johnson may request that the Commission 
consider his reinstatement by submitting an application (attention: Office of the Chief Accountant)  
to resume appearing or practicing before the Commission as: 
  
               1.      a preparer or reviewer, or a person responsible for the preparation or 
review, of any public company’s financial statements that are filed with the Commission.  Such 
an application must satisfy the Commission that Johnson’s work in his practice before the 
Commission will be reviewed either by the independent audit committee of the public company 
for which he works or in some other acceptable manner, as long as he practices before the 
Commission in this capacity; and/or  
                
               2.      an independent accountant.  Such an application must satisfy the 
Commission that: 
                
                  a.   Johnson, or the public accounting firm with which he is associated, is 
registered with the PCAOB in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and such 
registration continues to be effective; 
                           
                  b.   Johnson, or the registered public accounting firm with which he is 
associated, has been inspected by the PCAOB and that inspection did not identify any criticisms 
of or potential defects in Johnson’s or the firm’s quality control system that would indicate that 
the respondent will not receive appropriate supervision; 
 
                  c.   Johnson has resolved all disciplinary issues with the PCAOB, and has 
complied with all terms and conditions of any sanctions imposed by the PCAOB (other than 
reinstatement by the Commission); and 
                           
                  d.   Johnson acknowledges his responsibility, as long as Johnson appears or 
practices before the Commission as an independent accountant, to comply with all requirements 
of the Commission and the PCAOB, including, but not limited to, all requirements relating to 
registration, inspections, concurring partner reviews and quality control standards.   
 

                                               10
  
---------------------Page 11---------------------

 
           The Commission will consider an application by Johnson to resume appearing or 
practicing before the Commission provided that his state CPA license is current and he has 
resolved all other disciplinary issues with the applicable state boards of accountancy.  However, 
if state licensure is dependent on reinstatement by the Commission, the Commission will 
consider an application on its other merits.  The Commission’s review may include consideration 
of, in addition to the matters referenced above, any other matters relating to Johnson’s character, 
integrity, professional conduct, or qualifications to appear or practice before the Commission. 
            
   B.   HANNI 
 
           Hanni shall cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future 
violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 13a-1, 
13a-13, and 12b-20 promulgated thereunder.  
            
           Hanni is denied the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission as an 
accountant. 
            
           After two years from the date of this Order, Hanni may request that the Commission 
consider his reinstatement by submitting an application (attention: Office of the Chief Accountant)  
to resume appearing or practicing before the Commission as: 
 
              1.      a preparer or reviewer, or a person responsible for the preparation or 
review, of any public company’s financial statements that are filed with the Commission.  Such 
an application must satisfy the Commission that Hanni’s work in his practice before the 
Commission will be reviewed either by the independent audit committee of the public company 
for which he works or in some other acceptable manner, as long as he practices before the 
Commission in this capacity; and/or  
               
              2.      an independent accountant.  Such an application must satisfy the 
Commission that: 
               
                  a.   Hanni, or the public accounting firm with which he is associated, is 
registered with the PCAOB in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and such 
registration continues to be effective; 
                           
                  b.   Hanni, or the registered public accounting firm with which he is 
associated, has been inspected by the PCAOB and that inspection did not identify any criticisms 
of or potential defects in Hanni’s or the firm’s quality control system that would indicate that the 
respondent will not receive appropriate supervision; 
                           
                  c.   Hanni has resolved all disciplinary issues with the PCAOB, and has 
complied with all terms and conditions of any sanctions imposed by the PCAOB (other than 
reinstatement by the Commission); and 
                           

                                               11
  
---------------------Page 12---------------------

 
                      d.   Hanni acknowledges his responsibility, as long as Hanni appears or 
practices before the Commission as an independent accountant, to comply with all requirements 
of the Commission and the PCAOB, including, but not limited to, all requirements relating to 
registration, inspections, concurring partner reviews and quality control standards. 
 
             The Commission will consider an application by Hanni to resume appearing or 
practicing before the Commission provided that his state CPA license is current and he has 
resolved all other disciplinary issues with the applicable state boards of accountancy.  However, 
if state licensure is dependent on reinstatement by the Commission, the Commission will 
consider an application on its other merits.  The Commission’s review may include consideration 
of, in addition to the matters referenced above, any other matters relating to Hanni’s character, 
integrity, professional conduct, or qualifications to appear or practice before the Commission.
