                                                 I. 
 
              The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) deems it appropriate and in the 
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against Robert 
W. Davis (Respondent or Davis) pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(i) of the Commissions Rules of 
Practice.1
            
                                                   
                                                 II. 
 
              In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the Offer) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the 
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party and without admitting or denying the findings 
herein, except as to the Commissions jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these 
                                                 
1
 Rule 102(e)(3)(i) provides, in relevant part, that: 
 
                 The Commission, with due regard to the public interest and without preliminary hearing, may, by order, . . . 
suspend from appearing or practicing before it any . . . accountant . . . who has been by name . . . permanently 
enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction, by reason of his or her misconduct in an action brought by the 
Commission, from violating or aiding and abetting the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or of 
the rules and regulations thereunder. 
---------------------Page 2---------------------

proceedings, and the findings contained in Section III.3 below, which are admitted, Respondent 
consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Rule 102(e) 
of the Commissions Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions 
(Order), as set forth below.   
 
                                               III. 
 
              On the basis of this Order and Respondents Offer, the Commission finds that:  
         
                     1.           Davis, age 51, is and has been a certified public accountant licensed to 
practice in the Commonwealth of Virginia.  Davis joined Dell Inc. (Dell) in 1996.  In 2001, he 
was named Vice President of Corporate Planning and Reporting.  In November 2002, Davis was 
named Vice President of Corporate Finance and Chief Accounting Officer, positions he retained 
until he left Dell in February 2005. 
        
                     2.           Dell is a Fortune 50 company in the business of providing electronic 
products, including mobility products, desktop PCs, peripherals, servers, networking equipment, 
and storage.  Dell also offers services, including software, infrastructure technology, consulting 
and applications, and business process services.  Dell was incorporated in Delaware in 1984 and is 
based in Round Rock, Texas.  Since July 2006, Dells common stock has been registered with the 
Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) 
and is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.  During the prior relevant period, Dells 
common stock was registered with the Commission under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and 
quoted on the Nasdaq National Market System. 
        
                     3.           On August 27, 2010, the Commission filed a complaint against Davis in the 
U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia captioned Securities and Exchange Commission v. 
Robert W. Davis (Civil Action No. 1:10-cv-01464).  On October 13, 2010, the court entered an 
order permanently enjoining Davis, by consent, from future violations of Section 17(a)(2) and 
Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) 
and Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violations of Exchange Act 
Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder.  
Davis was also ordered to pay $19,080 in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, $9,078 in prejudgment 
interest, and a $175,000 civil money penalty. 
         
  4. The Commissions complaint alle                   ges, among other things, that Dell 
fraudulently committed various accounting violations through the conduct of Davis and others.  
The Commissions complaint also alleges that Davis directed and engaged in improper accounting 
that resulted in Dell filing materially false and misleading financial statements in the companys 
annual reports on Form 10-K and in the companys quarterly reports on Form 10-Q from FY02 to 
FY05.  The Complaint alleges that Davis directed Dells improper use of reserves, including the 
Strat Fund and other Corporate Contingencies, accrued relocation accruals, a Corporate 
restructuring reserve, and bonus and profit-sharing accruals.  The Commissions complaint alleges 
further that Davis directed others to maintain and track excess reserves and to use excess reserves 
from prior periods to offset unforecasted expenses in order to meet financial targets.  The 

                                                2 
---------------------Page 3---------------------

complaint also alleges that Davis was involved in Dells improper accounting with respect to 
Dells Europe, Middle East, and Africa segment restructuring reserve and Dells failure to increase 
its reserves for Las Cimas liabilities. 
 
                                                 IV. 
                                                    
        In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
impose the sanction agreed to in Respondent Daviss Offer. 
 
        Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that: 
 
              A.          Davis is suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an 
accountant. 
 
              B.          After five years from the date of this order, Respondent may request that the 
Commission consider his reinstatement by submitting an application (attention: Office of the 
Chief Accountant) to resume appearing or practicing before the Commission as: 
 
                            1.           a preparer or reviewer, or a person responsible for the preparation or 
review, of any public companys financial statements that are filed with the Commission.  Such 
an application must satisfy the Commission that Respondents work in his practice before the 
Commission will be reviewed either by the independent audit committee of the public company 
for which he works or in some other acceptable manner, as long as he practices before the 
Commission in this capacity; and/or 
 
  2. an independent accountant.  Su                    ch an application must satisfy the 
Commission that: 
      
                                         (a)         Respondent, or the public accounting firm with which he is 
associated, is registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight       Board (Board) in 
accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and such registration continues to be effective; 
 
   (b) Respondent, or the registered                           public accounting firm with which he 
is associated, has been inspected by the Board and that inspection did not identify any criticisms 
of or potential defects in the Respondents or the firms quality control system that would 
indicate that the Respondent will not receive appropriate supervision; 

   (c) Respondent has resolved all di                           sciplinary issues with the Board and 
has complied with all terms and conditions of any sanctions imposed by the Board (other than 
reinstatement by the Commission); and 
 
   (d) Respondent acknowledges                              his responsibility, as long as 
Respondent appears or practices before the Commission as an independent accountant, to 
comply with all requirements of the Commission and the Board, including, but not limited to, all 
requirements relating to registration, inspections, concurring partner reviews and quality control 
standards.   
                                                  3 
---------------------Page 4---------------------

 
          C.       The Commission will consider an application by Respondent to resume 
appearing or practicing before the Commission provided that his state CPA license is 
current and he has resolved all other disciplinary issues with the applicable state boards of 
accountancy.  However, if state licensure is dependent on reinstatement by the 
Commission, the Commission will consider an application on its other merits.  The 
Commissions review may include consideration of, in addition to the matters referenced 
above, any other matters relating to Respondents character, integrity, professional conduct, 
or qualifications to appear or practice before the Commission. 
 
 By the Commission.
