                                              II. 
 
       The Commission finds that: 
        
       A.     RESPONDENT 
 
              1.      Stormy L. Dean, age 54, is a resident of Ralston, Nebraska.  From 1995 
through 2008, Dean served in various capacities in the accounting department of infoUSA, Inc. 
(Info), an Omaha-based database marketing company.  At Info, Dean served as controller, 
principal accounting officer, and chief financial officer (CFO).  Dean was Infos CFO from 
January 2000 to September 2003, and then again from January 2006 through December 2008.  As 
Infos CFO, Dean signed and certified Infos public filings.  Dean passed the certified public 
accountant (CPA) examination in 1995 and holds a CPA certificate in the state of Nebraska.  
Dean has never obtained a CPA license.      
   
       B.     CIVIL INJUNCTION      AND FINDING OF LIABILITY FOR VIOLATIONS 
   
              2.      On May 29, 2012, the U.S. District Court for the District of Nebraska 
entered a final judgment against Dean, permanently enjoining him from future violations, direct or 
indirect, of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), 13(b)(5), and 14(a) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-14, 13b2-1, 13b2-2 , 14a-3, and 14a-9 
thereunder.  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Stormy L. Dean, et al., Civil Action Number 
8:10-cv-00102-LSC-FG3.  In the final judgment, the court declared that Dean acted in bad faith 
toward shareholders of [Info], when committing the acts and omissions that led to this proceeding, 
and knew his actions were contrary to the interests of [Info] and its shareholders.   
            
              3.      Previously, on March 2, 2012, after a trial, a jury for the U.S. District Court 
for the District of Nebraska, issued a verdict finding Dean liable for violations of Sections 10(b), 
13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), 13(b)(5), 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-
1, 13a-14, 13b2-1, 13b2-2, 14a-3, and 14a-9 thereunder.  Securities and Exchange Commission v. 
Stormy L. Dean, et al., Civil Action Number 8:10-cv-00102-LSC-FG3.        
        
              4.      The Commissions complaint alleged that Dean   signed and certified Infos 
false Forms 10-K and proxy statements that materially understated and failed to properly disclose 
the perquisite compensation of Vinod Gupta, Infos former chief executive officer and Chairman 
of the Board of Directors, and failed to properly disclose related party transactions involving 
Gupta.  The complaint alleged that for the years 2003 through 2007, Gupta used Info to pay for his 
personal expenses associated with private jet flights, a yacht, homes, automobiles, credit card 
expenses, country club memberships, and life insurance policies.  As CFO, Dean approved Infos 
payment of Guptas personal expenses and signed and certified Infos false Forms 10-K for 2005 
and 2006 which incorporated information from Infos proxy statements.  The complaint also 
alleged that Dean aided and abetted the filing of Infos false Form 10-K for 2003 which 
incorporated information from Infos proxy statements.

                                                III. 
        
       Based upon the foregoing, the Commission finds that a court of competent jurisdiction has 
found Respondent to have violated the Federal securities laws and permanently enjoined    him from 
violations of the Federal securities laws within the meaning of Rule 102(e)(3)(i)(A) and (B) of the 
Commissions Rules of Practice.  In view of these finding s, the Commission deems it appropriate 
and in the public interest that Respondent be temporarily suspended from appearing or practicing 
before the Commission. 
   
       IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Stormy L. Dean be, and hereby is, temporarily suspended 
from appearing or practicing before the Commission.  This Order shall be effective upon service 
on the Respondent. 
 
       IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent may within thirty days after service of this 
Order file a petition with the Commission to lift the temporary suspension.  If the Commission 
within thirty days after service of the Order receives no petition, the suspension shall become 
permanent pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(ii). 
  
        If a petition is received within thirty days after service of this Order, the Commission shall, 
within thirty days after the filing of the petition, either lift the temporary suspension, or set the 
matter down for hearing at a time and place to be designated by the Commission, or both.    If a 
hearing is ordered, following the hearing, the Commission may lift the suspension, censure the 
petitioner, or disqualify the petitioner from appearing or practicing before the Commission for a 
period of time, or permanently, pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(iii). 
 
       This Order shall be served upon Respondent    personally or by certified mail at his last 
known address. 
        
       By the Commission. 
 
 
 
                                                                                     Elizabeth M. Murphy 
                                                                                     Secretary 
 
  
 
 

                                                 3
