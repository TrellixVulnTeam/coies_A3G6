                                               III. 

        On the basis of this Order and Respondents Offers, the Commission finds1
                                                                                that: 

A. SUMMARY  

        1.      In April 2008, Symmetry restated its financial statements for its 2005 and 2006 
fiscal years and its first and second quarters of fiscal 2007, along with selected financial data for its 
2003-2006 fiscal years.  The restatement was required because of a financial fraud orchestrated by 
senior management at one of Symmetrys wholly owned subsidiaries, the Sheffield, England-
based Symmetry Medical Sheffield LTD, f/k/a Thornton Precision Components, Limited 
(TPC), whose financial data was at all relevant times consolidated into Symmetrys financial 
statements filed with the Commission.  Among other things, TPCs senior officersone of whom 
was also an officer of Symmetrymaterially overstated TPCs revenues and assets, materially 
understated its expenses, and falsified corporate books and records.   This misconduct went 
undetected and uncorrected in part because Symmetry failed to devise and maintain adequate 
internal accounting controls and because TPC personnel circumvented the controls that did exist. 
The fraud at TPC caused Symmetry to file with the Commission eight quarterly reports on Form 
10-Q and three annual reports on Form 10-K that materially misstated the Companys 
consolidated financial results throughout the relevant period.  It also caused Symmetrys books 
and records to be materially inaccurate throughout the relevant period. 

        2.      Moreover, in July 2006, Symmetrys CFO (Respondent Hite), did not provide 
Symmetrys Audit Committee with a copy of a status report concerning TPC by Symmetrys former 
Director of Internal Audit (the IA).  In the report, the IA identified exceptions at TPC, citing 
among other things bill-and-hold transactions, and failures by TPC (i) to provide requested 
evidence; (ii) to provide complete evidence; and (iii) to perform proper account reconciliations.  In 
the report the IA also sought permission to solicit outsourcing proposals from other Big Four firms 
to provide, for the balance of 2006 and for 2007, internal audit services at TPC that would include 
internal controls testing and financial audits there. The IA resigned from Symmetry shortly after 
preparing this report, and accordingly, was not present at the next Audit Committee meeting (held on 
July 26, 2006) to present the foregoing findings and request concerning TPC.  Hitethe conduit for 
materials to be included in board packets for directors considerationprovided the status report 
to the Companys independent auditor, but did not include it in the Board Packet for the July 2006 
Audit Committee meeting, and the Committee did not otherwise learn of the report until after the fraud 
at TPC was discovered in  September 2007. 

        3.      Finally, Hite received bonuses and incentive-based and equity-based compensation 
from Symmetry, and also realized Symmetry stock-sale profits, during periods covered by the 
Companys April 2008 restatement, for which he has not, to date, reimbursed Symmetry.

        The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondents Offers of Settlement and are not binding on any other 
person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

B. RESPONDENTS           

       4.      Symmetry Medical, Inc.   (Symmetry or the Company) is a Delaware 
corporation headquartered in Warsaw, Indiana.  Through its operating subsidiaries, Symmetry is a 
manufacturer of medical implants and instruments and also manufactures specialized products for 
the aerospace industry.  Since its December 2004 initial public offering, Symmetrys common 
stock has been registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and 
listed on the New York Stock Exchange.  At all relevant times, TPC was one of Symmetrys 
operating subsidiaries, and accounted for a substantial portion of Symmetrys consolidated revenues 
and net income. 

        5.    Fred L. Hite (Hite), age 44, has served as Symmetrys Chief Financial Officer and 
Senior Vice President since March 2004. 

C. FACTS  

       The Fraud at TPC  

        6.    Beginning prior to Symmetrys December 2004 initial public offering, and 
continuing until late September 2007, personnel at the Companys TPC subsidiaryled by certain 
members of TPCs senior managementengaged in a financial fraud through which TPCs 
consolidated assets and earnings were materially overstated.  As a result, the financial statements 
included in Symmetrys annual reports on Form 10-K for its 2004, 2005 and 2006 fiscal years, as well as 
its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for (among other quarters) the first and second quarters of its 2007 
fiscal year, were materially false and misleading and did not comply with generally accepted 
accounting principles (GAAP).  The financial fraud at TPC involved the systematic understatement 
of expenses and overstatement of assets and revenues, and was achieved primarily by improperly and 
prematurely recognizing revenue, improperly capitalizing expenses, overvaluing inventory, and 
understating costs of goods sold.  The scheme stopped only when, on September 24, 2007, a manager at 
TPC disclosed the scheme to Symmetrys CEO. 

       Symmetrys 2008 Restatement 

       7.     Several months later, as a direct result of the fraud at TPC, Symmetry restated its 
financial statements for its 2005 and 2006 fiscal years and for the first two quarters of its 2007 
fiscal year.  Symmetry also restated selected financial data for its 2003-2006 fiscal years. The 
cumulative impact of the restatementas the table below reflectswas, among other things, to 
reduce Symmetrys net income for its 2004 fiscal year from $11.7 million (as originally reported) 
to $8.4 million (as restated), its net income for its 2005 fiscal year from $31.8 million (as originally 
reported) to a net loss of $9.9 million (as restated), and its net income for its 2006 fiscal year from 
$24.1 million (as originally reported) to $18.5 million (as restated):

       8..    The restatement also caused the following percentage reductions to Symmetrys 
financial statement line items for accounts receivable, inventories, and total assets:

       Item                                                                     
 A/R (Net)                 -18%                -31%                -30%                -28%

       9.     In the seven months between the close of trading on October 4, 2007, after which 
Symmetry made its first disclosure concerning accounting irregularities at TPC, and the close of 
trading on April 25, 2008, the day after Symmetry filed its restatement, Symmetrys stock price fell 
more than 26%, from $17.74 per share to $13.05 per share.   

        Symmetrys Deficient Internal Controls 

       10.    Between 2004 and September 2007, Symmetry failed to implement and maintain 
adequate internal controls over financial reporting that were sufficient to provide reasonable 
assurance that Symmetrys financial statements were accurately stated in accordance with GAAP.  As 
a result, Symmetrys accounting controls failed to prevent or detect the above-described fraud at TPC 
that led to the Companys April 2008 restatement. 

       11.    Symmetry did not maintain an effective control environment at its TPC subs  idiary.  
This control deficiency included inadequate operation of corporate entity-level controls, including 
monitoring controls that were not sufficiently sensitive in scope and therefore failed to detect and 
prevent on a timely basis management override of controls at TPC and collusion of TPCs 
management team to achieve desired financial accounting results.  In certain instances, information 
                                                 
2
 $33.6 millionor more than 80%--of the reduction in earnings for FY 2005 resulted from the write down of goodwill 
associated with the acquisition of TPC, since the fraud at TPC had pre-dated the acquisition. 
 
3
   Symmetrys gross profits for Q2 2007 were, however, materially reduced as a result of the restatement, from $15.5 
million (as originally reported) to $14.7 million (as restated).

critical to an effective review of transactions and accounting entries was not disclosed to corporate 
management and internal and external auditors. 

       12.    TPC did not maintain effective controls over the period-end financial reporting 
process, including controls with respect to journal entries, account reconciliations and proper 
segregation of duties.  Journal entries, both recurring and nonrecurring, were not uniformly 
accompanied by sufficient supporting documentation and were not adequately reviewed and 
approved for validity, completeness and accuracy.  Account reconciliations over balance sheet 
accounts were not uniformly properly performed and approved for validity and accuracy of 
supporting documentation.  TPC did not uniformly uphold proper segregation of duties within their 
accounting department with respect to financial reporting. 

       13.    TPC did not maintain effective controls over the inventory management process 
including controls with respect to inventory existence.  TPC did not utilize a comprehensive 
enterprise resources planning (ERP) system to control its inventories, but rather relied upon 
physical inventory counts.  The process for compiling and reconciling these physical counts to the 
general ledger was subject to management override of controls and a lack of proper segregation of duties 
resulting in inaccurate reporting of inventory quantities on hand. 

       14.   TPC did not maintain effective controls over the sales and accounts receivable process, 
including controls with respect to the existence of receivables, sales cutoff, the application of cash 
receipts, and segregation of duties.  Accordingly, certain sales transactions were fictitiously recorded 
while certain other transactions were recorded prior to the completion of the revenue process. 

       15.    TPC did not maintain effective controls over the preparation of the income tax provisions 
and related deferred and current tax calculations.  Account analyses and reconciliations were not 
prepared for various tax accounts resulting in erroneous entries which were posted to the tax accounts 
not being detected or corrected in a timely manner. 

       Hites Conduct 

       A.     The Internal Audit Status Report 

       16.    In the Fall of 2005, Symmetry created an internal audit unit, headed by the IA, who 
was to report to the Chairman of Symmetrys Audit Committee.  On July 17, 2006, the IA provided 
Hite and the Companys independent auditor with   a status report for submission to Symmetrys 
Audit Committee for consideration at its next meeting, which was scheduled to be held at TPC on 
July 26, 2006.  Hite was the conduit for materials to be included in the board packets provided to 
Symmetrys directors in connection with their board and committee meetings.  In that report, the 
IA claimed to have identified problematic bill-and-hold transactions at TPC and further asserted that 
TPC personnel had not provided requested evidence pertaining to the IAs Q1 2006 sales cut  -off , 
cash cutoff and monthly controls testing.  By July 2006, TPC was misstating its revenues and net 
income primarily by booking top-side journal entries of fictitious sales revenue and overvaluing 
inventory to conceal its understatement of costs of goods sold.  These misstatements had not been 
                                               5 
 
---------------------Page 6---------------------

detected by the IA and were not included in the report.  Rather the IAs report only implied the 
potential presence of deeper problems at TPC, since the report sought permission to solicit 
outsourcing proposals from Big Four   accounting firms to provide, for the remainder of 2006 and 
2007, internal audit services at TPC to include internal controls testing and financial audits there, 
saying, The extent and severity of issues identified at [TPC] exceed the size and ability of IAs 
current staff and consultants from other firms. 

       17.    Hite forwarded the status report to the Companys independent auditor    as well as 
Symmetrys controller and they discussed it with the IA.  After the IA resigned on or about July 
19, 2006, Hite did not, however, include the report in the board packet for the July 26 Audit 
Committee meeting.  According to the minutes of that meeting, Hite told the Committee that the 
IA had tested all facilities and all were acceptable with a few exceptions found at [TPC].  The 
Audit Committee discussed the IAs resignation and thereafter the chair of th e Audit Committee 
conducted an exit interview with the IA.  However,   Hite did not provide the IAs report to the 
Audit Committee, and the Committee did not otherwise learn of the report until after the fraud at 
TPC was discovered.  Hite did immediately hire a new IA whose initial work included internal 
controls testing at TPC. 

         B.   The Receipt of Bonuses, Equity-Based Compensation and Stock-Sale Proceeds  

       18.    As  a result of the misconduct at TPC described in paragraph 6 above, Symmetry 
issued materially inaccurate and non-compliant accounting statements in its (i) December 2004 
initial public offering and July 2005 secondary offering registration statements; (ii) annual public 
filings with the Commission for fiscal years 2004, 2005 and 2006; and (iii) quarterly public filings 
for the first and second quarters of 2007.  Specifically, Symmetry filed Forms 10-K for fiscal years 
2004 through 2006 and Forms 10-Q for the first and second quarters of 2007 that were in material 
non-compliance with its financial reporting requirements under the federal securities laws, and 
Symmetry was required to restate its financial statements for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 and for 
the first two quarters of its 2007 fiscal year, along with selected financial data for its 2003-2006 
fiscal years. 

              19.        During the 12-month periods following Symmetrys filing of inaccurate financial 
statements in: (i) its December 2004 IPO and July 2005 registration statements; (ii) its 2004-6 
annual public filings; and (iii) its quarterly filings for the first and second quarters of 2007, 
Respondent Hite received, from Symmetry, bonuses and incentive and equity based compensation, 
and also realized profits from the sale of Symmetry stock. 

              20.        Respondent Hite has not reimbursed Symmetry for the bonuses, incentive and 
equity-based compensation or profits from sales of Symmetry stock that he received or obtained 
during the statutory time periods established by Section 304(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 

 

                                                 6 
 
---------------------Page 7---------------------

              21.        The Commission has not exempted Respondent Hite, pursuant to Section 304(b) of 
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2004 [15 U.S.C. § 7243(b)], from the application of Section 304(a) [15 
U.S.C. § 7243(a)] of that Act. 
                
       Symmetry's Remedial Efforts  
        
       22.    In determining to accept the Offers, the Commission considered remedial acts 
promptly undertaken by Symmetry and cooperation afforded the Commission staff by 
Respondents.  

D. LEGAL ANALYSIS 

       Symmetry 

       23.    Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Exchange Act Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 require issuers of 
registered securities to file annual and quarterly reports with the Commission.  Exchange Act Rule 12b-
20 requires that these periodic reports contain all material information necessary to make the required 
statements not misleading.  The filing of a periodic report containing materially false or misleading 
information constitutes a violation of these provisions.  SEC v. Savoy Indus., Inc., 587 F.2d 1149, 1165 
(D.C. Cir. 1978).  Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(A) requires issuers of registered securities to make and 
keep books, records, and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions 
and dispositions of assets. Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(B) requires such issuers to devise and 
maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that its 
transactions were recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity 
with generally accepted accounting principles.  Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) provides that no person 
shall, among other things, knowingly circumvent a companys system of internal accounting controls. 
       24.    As described above, Symmetry failed to devise and maintain effective internal 
accounting controls in violation of Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(B).  This failure allowed officers 
and employees of Symmetrys TPC subsidiary to perpetrate a financial fraud that caused Symmetry to 
maintain materially inaccurate books, records, and accounts in violation of Exchange Act Section 
13(b)(2)(A), and to file periodic reports with the Commission that included materially false and 
misleading financial statements in violation of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Exchange Act Rules 
12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13.  In particular, the assets and earnings Symmetry reported in its annual 
reports on Form 10-K for its 2004 through 2006 fiscal years, and its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for 
the first two quarters of its 2007 fiscal year, were materially overstated. 

       Hite  
       25.    Symmetrys internal audit function, and the reports prepared by Symmetrys IA for 
Symmetrys Audit Committee in connection with the IAs internal audit testing, were, as Hite knew, 
a part of Symmetrys system of internal accounting controls as defined in Exchange Act Section 
13(b)(2)(B).  Hite knowingly circumvented this facet of Symmetrys system of internal accounting controls 
                                                7 
 
---------------------Page 8---------------------

by failing to furnish the IAs report to Symmetrys Audit Committee.  Accordingly, Hite violated 
Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and was a cause of Symmetrys violation of Exchange Act Section 
13(b)(2)(B). 
       26.    As a result of Hites failure to reimburse Symmetry for the bonuses, incentive and 
equity-based compensation or profits from sales of Symmetry stock that he received or obtained during 
the statutory time periods established by Section 304(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Hite 
violated that provision. 

                                              IV. 

                                         FINDINGS 

       Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that: 

         (a) Symmetry violated Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) and 
            Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder; and 

         (b) Hite violated Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 304(a),
