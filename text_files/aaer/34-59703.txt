payments to the Internal Revenue Service.     
        
       3.           As a result of this decision and order, Wises Arizona license as a certified public 
accountant was revoked.

accountant has been revoked within the meaning of Rule 102(e)(2) of the Commissions Rules of

practicing before the Commission pursuant to Rule 102(e)(2) of the Commission=s Rules of
