A.     RESPONDENT 

       William E. Costello, CPA, 69, of Bakersfield, California, is a certified public accountant 
licensed in the state of California since 1965 and doing business as a sole proprietorship.  Costello 
audited Global Links Corp.’s financial statements for the company’s 2003 fiscal year ended 
December 31, 2003. 

B.     FACTS 

       1.     Global Links Corp. (“Global Links”) is a Nevada corporation with its headquarters 
in Las Vegas, Nevada.  Global Links’ common stock is registered with the Commission pursuant 
to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and is quoted in the pink sheets under the symbol GLLK.PK.  
For its fiscal year ended December 31, 2003, Global Links reported revenues of $132,000 and total 
assets of $1.8 million.  Global Links filed a Form 8-K with the Commission on February 2, 2005, 
announcing that it had dismissed Costello as its independent auditor on February 1, 2005. 

       2.     Global Links has at all relevant times been an issuer as defined by the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Act”). 

       3.     Costello audited Global Links’ 2003 financial statements included in Global Links’ 
annual report for fiscal year 2003 on Form 10-KSB, filed with the Commission on April 14, 2004.  
As part of that audit, Costello prepared and issued an audit report dated April 14, 2004 (the  

       any provision of the Federal securities     laws or the rules and regulations 
       thereunder. 
3 
       The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent’s Offer of Settlement and are not 
binding on any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

“Global Links audit report”), which the company included in its 2003 Form 10-KSB.  Global 
Links paid Costello $1,250 for the audit work.4 

       4.     At the time Costello prepared and issued the Global Links audit report, he was not 
registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the “Board”), as required by 
Section 102(a) of the Act. 

C.     VIOLATIONS 

       1.     Section 102(a) of the Act provides that “it shall be unlawful for any person that is 
not a registered public accounting firm to prepare or issue, or to participate in the preparation or 
issuance of, any audit report with respect to any issuer.”5 

       2.     The provisions of Section 102(a) of the Act became effective on October 22, 2003.6 

       3.     Based on the conduct described above, Respondent willfully 7
                                                                           violated Section 
102(a) of the Act. 

D. FINDI      NGS 

       Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that Costello willfully violated Section 
102(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 

4 
       During the course of the Commission’s investigation, Costello voluntarily reimbursed 
Global Links the $1,250 in audit fees.  In view of Costello’s reimbursement, the Commission is 
not ordering disgorgement in this matter. 
5 
       A violation of the Act or any rule that the Board issues under the Act is treated for all 
purposes in the same manner as a violation of the Exchange Act, including with respect to 
penalties.  Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 15 U.S.C.A. § 7202(b)(1) (West 2002). 
6 
       Section 102(a) became effective “[b]eginning 180 days after the date of the determination 
of the Commission under Section 101(d)” of the Act that the Board was prepared to undertake its 
statutory responsibilities.  The Commission made the required determination on April 25, 2003.  
See Order Regarding Section 101(d) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Securities Act Release 
No. 8223, Exchange Act Release No. 47746, 2003 WL 1956164  (Apr. 25, 2003). 
7
       “Willfully” as used in this Order means intentionally committing the act that constitutes 
the violation.  There is no requirement that the actor also be aware that he is violating a rule or 
statute.  See Wonsover v. SEC, 205 F.3d 408, 414 (D.C. Cir. 2000); Tager v. SEC, 344 F.2d 5, 8 
(2d Cir. 1965).

E.     UNDERTAKING 

       Respondent undertakes not to request, demand, or accept, directly or indirectly, any 
compensation from Global Links in connection with the audit work associated with the Global 
Links audit report.  In determining whether to accept the Offer, the Commission has considered 
this undertaking. 

                                              IV. 

       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in Respondent’s Offer. 

       Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that: 

       A.     Costello shall cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any 
future violations of Section 102(a) of the Act. 

       B.     Costello is censured. 

       C.     Costello may practice before the Commission as an independent accountant 
provided that: 

              1.      The public accounting firm with which he is associated is registered with 
the Board in accordance with the Act, and such registration continues to be effective; and 

              2.      He has submitted to the Commission staff (attention: Office of the Chief 
Accountant) the Board’s letter notifying the public accounting firm with which he is associated that 
its registration application has been approved.

 By       the Commission.
