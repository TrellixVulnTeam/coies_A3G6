Practice.1
           
                                              
                                            II. 
 
      In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer

      The Commission, with due regard to the public interest and without preliminary hearing, 
may, by order, . . . suspend from appearing or practicing before it any . . . accountant . . . who has

herein, except as to the Commissions jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these 
proceedings, and the findings contained in Section III below, which are admitted, Respondent 
consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Rule 102(e) 
of the Commissions Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions 
(Order), as set forth below.   
 
                                              III. 
 
       On the basis of this Order and Respondents Offer, the Commission finds that: 
 
              1.      Benson, age 67, held a Texas CPA license until voluntarily surrendering it in 
2008.  He served as Chief Financial Officer of DGSE Companies Inc. (DGSE) from 1992   until 
2011. 
        
              2.      DGSE was, at all relevant times, a Nevada corporation headquartered in 
Dallas, Texas that buys and sells jewelry and bullion products for individual consumers, dealers, 
and institutions.  Its common stock is registered with the Commission under Section 12(b) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and is traded on the NYSE MKT under the 
symbol DGSE. 
 
              3.      On June 2, 2014, a final judgment was entered against Benson, permanently 
enjoining him from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities 
Act) and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1, and 
13b2-2 thereunder, and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 
13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and   13a-13, in the civil action entitled 
Securities and Exchange Commission v. DGSE Companies Inc. and I. John Benson, Civil Action 
Number 3:14-cv-01909-B, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas.  
Benson was also ordered to pay a $75,000 civil money penalty. 
 
              4.      The Commissions complaint alleged, among other things, that Benson 
 engaged in a fraudulent scheme which resulted in DGSE filing materially false and misleading 
 financial statements in the companys annual report on DGSEs Forms 10 -K for the Fiscal Years 
 Ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2010, as well as quarterly filings for the same 
 period.  Benson also allegedly signed false management certifications, which were attached to 
 these filings.  In addition, the complaint alleged that while Benson was DGSEs CFO, DGSE 
 failed to maintain sufficient accounting controls, and that Benson circumvented the controls 
 that DGSE did have.  Finally, the complaint alleged that Benson made false statements to 
 DGSEs external auditors. 
        
                                              IV. 
                                                
       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
impose the sanction agreed to in Respondent Bensons Offer.

       Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that Benson    is suspended 
from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant. 
 
 
       By the Commission.
