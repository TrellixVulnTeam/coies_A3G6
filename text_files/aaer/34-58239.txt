                                                                             that:

C. VIO      LATIONS 

       1.     Section 4C(a) of the Exchange Act provides, in relevant part, that the Commission 
“may censure any person, or deny, temporarily or permanently, to any person the privilege of 
appearing or practicing before the Commission in any way, if that person is found by the 
Commission … (1) not to possess the requisite qualifications to represent others … or (3) to have 
willfully violated, or willfully aided and abetted the violation of, any provision of the securities 
laws or the rules and regulations issued thereunder.” 

       2.     Rule 102(e)(1) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice provides that the 
Commission “may censure a person or deny, temporarily or permanently, the privilege of 
appearing or practicing before it in any way to any person who is found by the Commission ... (i) 
not to possess the requisite qualifications to represent others … or (iii) to have willfully violated … 
any provision of the Federal securities laws or the rules and regulations thereunder.” 

       3.     Section 102(a) of the Act provides that “it shall be unlawful for any person that is 
not a registered public accounting firm to prepare or issue, or to participate in the preparation or 
issuance of, any audit report with respect to any issuer.”2 

       4.     The provisions of Section 102(a) of the Act became effective on October 22, 2003. 3 

       5.     Based on the conduct described above, the Firm willfully4
                                                                        violated Section 102(a) 
of the Act. 

       D.     FINDINGS 

       1.     Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that the Firm and Dow did not 
possess the requisite qualifications to represent others. 

2 
       A violation of the Act or any rule that the PCAOB issues under the Act is treated for all 
purposes in the same manner as a violation of the Exchange Act, including with respect to 
penalties.  Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 15 U.S.C.A. § 7202(b)(1) (West 2002). 
3 
       Section 102(a) became effective “[b]eginning 180 days after the date of the determination 
of the Commission under Section 101(d)” of the Act that the Board was prepared to undertake its 
statutory responsibilities.  The Commission made the required determination on April 25, 2003.  
See Order Regarding Section 101(d) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Securities Act Release 
No. 8223, Exchange Act Release No. 47746, 2003 WL 1956164  (Apr. 25, 2003). 
4 
       A willful violation of the securities laws means merely that the peron charged with the 
violation knows what he is doing.  Wonsover v. SEC, 205 F.3d 408, 414 (D.C. Cir. 2000). 

                                               3

       2.     Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that the Firm willfully violated 
Section 102(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 

                                              IV. 

       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in Respondents’ Offer. 

       Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that: 

       1.      Choi Dow Ian Hong & Lee Accountancy Corporation  

              A.      The Firm is denied the privilege of appearing or practicing before the 
Commission as an accountant. 

              B.      After one year from the date of this Order, the Firm may request that the 
Commission consider its reinstatement by submitting an application (attention: Office of the Chief 
Accountant) to resume appearing or practicing before the Commission as: 

                      1.  a preparer or reviewer, or a person responsible for the preparation or 
review, of any public company’s financial statements that are filed with the Commission.  Such an 
application must satisfy the Commission that the Firm’s work in the Firm’s practice before the 
Commission will be reviewed either by the independent audit committee of the public company for 
which the Firm works or in some other acceptable manner, as long as the Firm practices before the 
Commission in this capacity; and/or 

                      2.  an independent accountant.  Such an application must satisfy the 
Commission that: 

                             (a)  the Firm is registered with the PCAOB in accordance with the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and such registration continues to be effective.  However, if 
registration with the PCAOB is dependent upon reinstatement by the Commission, the 
Commission will consider an application on its other merits; 

                             (b)  the Firm has resolved all disciplinary issues with the PCAOB, 
and has complied with all terms and conditions of any sanctions imposed by the PCAOB (other 
than reinstatement by the Commission); and 

                             (c)  the Firm acknowledges responsibility, as long as the Firm 
appears or practices before the Commission as an independent accountant, to comply with all 
requirements of the Commission and the PCAOB, including, but not limited to, all requirements 
relating to registration, inspections, concurring partner reviews and quality control standards.   

              C.      The Commission will consider an application by the Firm to resume 
appearing or practicing before the Commission provided that the Firm’s state CPA license is 
current and the Firm has resolved all other disciplinary issues with the applicable state boards of 

                                               4

accountancy.  However, if state licensure is dependent on reinstatement by the Commission, the 
Commission will consider an application on its other merits.  The Commission’s review may 
include consideration of, in addition to the matters referenced above, any other matters relating to 
the Firm’s character, integrity, professional conduct, or qualifications to appear or practice before 
the Commission. 

       2.     Ernest E. Dow, CPA 

              A.      Dow is censured. 

              B.      Dow may practice before the Commission as an independent accountant 
provided that: 

                      1.     The public accounting firm with which he is associated is registered 
with the PCAOB in accordance with the Act, and such registration continues to be effective; and  

       2.     He has submitted to the Commission staff (Attention: Office of the Chief 
Accountant) the PCAOB’s letter notifying the public accounting firm with which he is associated 
that its registration application has been approved. 

 By       the Commission.
