Background
Ralphs operates retail grocery stores in southern California.

In 1998, Stork served as Ralphs' Vice President of Accounting.
In May 1999, Kroger acquired Fred Meyer, Food 4 Less, and Ralphs.
In December 1999, Stork became Ralphs' controller for three months before being promoted to vice president of finance in April 2000, and then leaving Ralphs.
On March 5, 2001, Kroger announced that as a result of its investigation it would restate earnings for fiscal years 1998, 1999, and the first two quarters of 2000 to conform with generally accepted accounting principals (GAAP).
In a press release dated March 5, 2001, Kroger stated that Ralphs had engaged in certain improper accounting practices that began more than one year before Fred Meyer acquired Ralphs.

In a press release dated March 5, 2001, Kroger stated that Ralphs had engaged in certain improper accounting practices that began more than one year before Fred Meyer acquired Ralphs.
Kroger also announced specific adjustments to its financial statements.
These adjustments restated amounts that had been improperly placed in the seven General Liability Accounts, and corrected the reduction of the General Liability Accounts in later periods.
It affected Kroger's net income, earnings per share, and assets, and liabilities as follows:

Q1, 2000
$ 0.12
$ 0.12
Q2, 2000
$ 0.26
$ 0.25
Kroger's adjustments also affected the fiscal year 1998 pre-tax income of Fred Meyer.
In that year, the adjustments, on balance, released amounts from the General Liability Accounts that had the effect of increasing Fred Meyer's reported income (before income taxes, extraordinary items, and adjustments for GAAP changes) by $16.36 million or 8.9 percent.
Unsupported Balances in Balance Sheet Accounts
For Ralphs' fiscal year 1998, Ralphs misstated its earnings.
Ralphs placed excess income in the General Liability Accounts on its balance sheet instead of recognizing the income immediately through its income statement in conformity with GAAP.
When an accounts receivable employee at Ralphs received an atypical, or non-recurring, check or other income receipt, Ralphs, on occasion, recorded that item in one of the General Liability Accounts that functioned without proper documentation or accounting basis as reserve accounts.
Ralphs also inflated certain expenses and correspondingly built up the General Liability Accounts.
Then, from time to time, Ralphs transferred amounts from the General Liability Accounts into income without proper documentation or accounting basis.
Ralphs also placed excess expense accruals in the General Liability Accounts.
By the end of a period, if operating expenses reported to the accounting department (such as repairs, maintenance, and supplies) lagged behind forecasted expenses, Ralphs booked additional, estimated expenses, often conforming expenses to forecast.
At period end, Ralphs transferred the amount of expenses, as adjusted, into one of the General Liability Accounts, such as account number 239133 (Other Liabilities).
In 1999, Ralphs significantly under-accrued for self-insurance and certain other expenses.
In early 2000, in connection with the fiscal 1999 year-end closing, Ralphs transferred large amounts from the General Liability Accounts to meet those expenses, including $6.2 million transferred in accounting period 4 of 2000 from Account Number 239189 "Other Clearing."
In addition, Ralphs had obtained more revenue than it needed to meet its fiscal year 1999 goal.
Ralphs placed the extra funds in the General Liability Accounts.
In March 2000, Ralphs transferred $2,100,000 of these amounts to a grocery department income account by debiting the General Liability Accounts for $2,100,000 and crediting the money to a grocery department account.
Quarter End Dispersals from the General Liability Accounts
At the end of each quarter, including year-end, Ralphs used journal entries to transfer substantial portions of the balances of the General Liability Accounts to other liability accounts.
At the beginning of the next period, Ralphs automatically reversed these journal entries and restored the pre-existing balances to the General Liability Accounts.
This process had the effect of reducing the balances in the General Liability Accounts at quarter end.
For the period 1997 to 1999, each of Ralphs' successive controllers made these reversing journal entries at quarter end on Ralphs' general ledger.
In fact, no one other than the controller or his assistant made these adjustments to the trial balance at the end of the quarters.
Ralphs continued to make unsupported adjustments, including reversing journal entries, at the end of each quarterly period for each of the three years.
Respondent's Conduct
Respondent served as controller of Ralphs.
He generated or directed the generation of journal entries that booked income receipts into the General Liability Accounts.
Respondent also created or approved journal entries that subsequently transferred amounts from the General Liability Accounts into income accounts.
He also used automatic reversing entries at quarter end to disperse portions of the balances of the General Liability Accounts to other accounts.
These dispersals had the effect of reducing the balances in the General Liability Accounts at quarter end below audit thresholds.
As a result, Respondent circumvented the internal controls that then existed at Ralphs.
C.
As a result of the conduct described above, Respondent Mortensen committed violations of Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder.
IV.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions specified in Respondent's Offer.
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:
Respondent Stork cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder.
By the Commission.
