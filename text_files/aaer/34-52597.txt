                                              I.

                                              II.  
 
       In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (“Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the purpose of  
these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the Commission, or to 
which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings herein, except as 
to the Commission’s jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these proceedings, and the 
findings contained in Section III.3  below, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of 
this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s 
Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (“Order”), as set forth 
below. 
 
                                             III.  
 
       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that:  
 
              1.     Hauke, age 57, has been a certified public accountant licensed to practice in   
the States of New York and New Jersey.  In 1998 and 1999 he was an accountant and partner in 
Van Buren & Hauke LLC, an accounting firm in New York.  During that time, he provided 
accounting and auditing services for Ramoil Management Ltd. (“RAMO”), a publicly-traded 
company. 
        
              2.      RAMO was a reporting company headquartered in Boca Raton, Florida 
during the time period relevant to this matter.   RAMO’s stock was registered with the Commission  
pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and traded on  
the over-the-counter bulletin board.  On March 28, 2001, RAMO was delisted by the NASD for   
failing to file current financial statements with the Commission in accordance with Regulation S-
X. 
 
              3.     On October 11, 2001, the Commission filed a complaint against Hauke and 
others, including RAMO, SEC v. Ramoil Management Ltd., et al., (Civil Action No. 
1:01CV09057).  On September 20, 2005, the court entered an order permanently enjoining Hauke, 
by consent, from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) 
of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting future violations of 
Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act and Rule 15d-1 thereunder pursuant to Section 20(e) of the  
Exchange Act.  Hauke also was ordered to pay $50,000 in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains from 
his accounting fees, and $16,448.22 in prejudgment interest; and an $85,000 civil money penalty. 
        
              4.      The Commission’s complaint alleged, among other things, that Hauke 
prepared a fraudulent audit report for inclusion in RAMO’s 1999 Form 10-K.  Neither Hauke nor 
anyone else had audited RAMO’s financial statements.  The fraudulent audit report Hauke 

                                               2

prepared purportedly was authored by another  accountant who had not reviewed or audited 
RAMO’s financial statements and who was not a certified public accountant.  Hauke attached the 
other accountant’s name to the audit report he prepared to mislead RAMO, its investors and the                 
Commission into believing that the financial statements had been audited.  Hauke submitted the 
fraudulent audit report to RAMO’s general counsel for incorporation in the company’s 1999 Form  
10-K that was filed with the Commission. 
 
                                                       IV. 
                                                          
         In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to      
impose the sanction agreed to in Respondent Hauke’s Offer. 
 
         Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that Hauke is suspended from         
appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant. 
 
 
 
 
 By the Commission.

       Secretary
