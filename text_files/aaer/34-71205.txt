              DARREN M. BENNETT, CPA                                      EXTENSION 
    
 
       Chief Administrative Law Judge Brenda P. Murray has moved, pursuant to Commission 
Rule of Practice 360(a)(3),1
                           for a  six -month extension to issue the initial decision  in th is 
proceeding.  For the reasons set forth below, we grant her motion.  

       On January 9, 2013, we issued an Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings ("OIP") 
against John J.  Aesoph, CPA and Darren M. Bennett, CPA, auditors at KPMG, LLP . 2
                                                                                   The OIP 
alleges that Aesoph and Bennett  repeatedly engaged in improper professional conduct , as defined 
in Section 4C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) of the Comm ission 
Rules of Practice,3
                  during their year -end 2008 audit of TierOne Corporation, a holding company 
for TierOne Bank (collectively, "TierOne"), by failing to subject TierOne's loan loss estimates to 
appropriate scrutiny. 

       The OIP direct s the presiding law  judge to issue an initial decision within 300 days of  the 
date of service of the OIP.  On November 26, 2013, Chief Judge Murray filed a motion stating 
that the initial decision is due on January 1, 2014, and requesting an extension pursuant to 
Commission Rule of Practice 360(a)(3). 

       We adopted Rules of Practice 360(a)(2) and 360(a)(3) to enhance the timely and efficient 
adjudication and disposition of Commission administrative proceedings by setting deadlines for

issuance of an initial decision.4
                                 The rules  further provide for deadline extensions under certain 
circumstances, if supported by a motion from the Chief Administrative Law Judge and we 
determine that "additional time is necessary or appropriate in the public interest."5
                                                                                    

       In her motion, Chief Judge Murray stat es that it will not be possible for the presiding law 
judge to issue an initial decision by the due date.  She notes that  the hearing in th is proceeding , 
which took place between October 7 and 11, 2013, and October 28 and 31, 2013, had been      
"postponed for over three months" because ( i) the parties and the judge agreed to a delay because 
Bennett's long-time counsel was recovering "from a sudden medical condition;" and 
(ii) "uncertainty of a government shutdown in early October 2013."  She also notes that the 
"nine-day hearing produced a record of over 2,300 pages of transcript and over 150 exhibits," 
and the post-hearing reply briefs are not due until December 19, 2013.  Moreover, the presiding 
law judge is responsible for initial decisions in two proceedings with hearings that concluded in 
May and September 2013, one of which produced an extensive      record.   Under the circumstances, 
it is appropriate in the public interest to grant the Chief Administrative Law Judge's request and 
to extend the deadline for issuance of a decision in this matter. 

       Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that the deadline for filing the initial decision in this 
proceeding is extended to   July 1, 2014. 

       By the Commission.
