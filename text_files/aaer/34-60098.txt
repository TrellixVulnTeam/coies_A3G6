      The Securities and Exchange Commission deems it appropriate  to issue an order of 
forthwith suspension of Elizabeth Monrad (“Monrad”) pursuant to Rule 102(e)(2) of the 
Commission’s Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R. § 201.102(e)(2)].1

      The Commission finds that:  
 
      1.     Monrad was licensed as a certified public accountant in Massachusetts from 1983 
to June 30, 1993, when her licensed expired.  She was the chief financial officer of General Re

chief financial officer of another company.  From May 2002 through July 2003, Monrad also 
was a member of the executive committee of Gen Re’s board of directors.  From 1997, Monrad 
was the chief financial officer of Gen Re’s North American Operations.   
 
       
      2.     On April 14, 2009, a judgment of conviction was entered against Monrad in

United States v. Elizabeth Monrad, et al, No. 06 CR 137 (CFI), in the United States District 
Court for the District of Connecticut, finding her guilty of sixteen felony counts, including 1 
count of conspiracy to violate the Federal securities laws and to commit mail fraud, 7 counts of 
securities fraud, 5 counts of making false statements to the Commission, and 3 counts of mail 
fraud.  The criminal indictment against Monrad resulted from her participation in a scheme to 
help American International Group, Inc. (“AIG”) structure two sham reinsurance transactions.  
These sham transactions were a fraudulent device by which AIG added a total of $500 million in 
phony loss reserves to its balance sheet, $250 million in the fourth quarter of 2000 and another 
$250 million in the first quarter of 2001.   
        
       3.     The court sentenced Monrad to 18 months imprisonment followed by 24 months 
of supervised release and ordered her to pay a fine of $250,000. 
 
                                              III. 
 
       In view of the foregoing, the Commission finds that Monrad has been convicted of a 
felony within the meaning of Rule 102(e)(2) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice. 
 
       Accordingly, it is ORDERED, that Elizabeth Monrad is forthwith suspended from  
appearing or practicing before the Commission pursuant to Rule 102(e)(2) of the Commission’s 
Rules of Practice.  
        
 
       By the Commission.
