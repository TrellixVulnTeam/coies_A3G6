 1         Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") alleges 
 2   as follows: 
 3                           JURISDICTION       AND VENUE 
 4         1.    This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(b), 
 5  20(d)(l),  and 22(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act"), 15 U.S.C. §§ 
 6  77t(b), 77t(d)(l),  and 77v(a).  Defendant has directly or indirectly made use of the 
 7  means or instruments  of transportation or communication in interstate commerce, 
 8  or of the mails, to engage in the transactions, practices, and courses of business 
 9  alleged in this Complaint. 
10         2.    Venue is proper in this district pursuant to Section 22(a) ofthe 
11   Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. § 77v(a), because Defendant resides and transacts 
12  business within this district and certain of the transactions, acts, practices and 
13   courses of conduct constituting violations of the federal securities laws alleged in 
14  this Complaint occurred within this district. 
15                                     SUMMARY 
16         3.    This action involves securities law violations committed by S. Blair 
17   Abernathy ("Abernathy"), the former Executive Vice President and Chief 
18   Financial Officer of IndyMac Bancorp, Inc. ("IndyMac"). 
19         4.    IndyMac through its main subsidiary - IndyMac Bank, F.S.B. 
20  ("IndyMac Bank" or "the Bank") - primarily made, purchased, and sold residential 
21   mortgage loans.  In July 2008, IndyMac Bank was placed under Federal Deposit 
22  Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") receivership and IndyMac filed for bankruptcy 
23  protection. 
24  A.	   False  and  Misleading  Statements  in the Offer and  Sale of IndyMac's 
25         Residential  Mortgage-Backed  Securities   in 2007 
26         5.    In 2007, IndyMac Bank conducted six offerings totaling $2.5 billion 
27   of residential mortgage-backed securities ("RMBS").  RMBS are securitizations   of 
28  pools of loans, and RMBS investors receive payments out    of the principal and 

                                              1
 
---------------------Page 3---------------------

  1  interest that residential loan borrowers pay on the underlying loans.  Each of those 
  2  six offerings, however, misrepresented the quality of the loans underlying each 
  3  offering.  Prior to and during the RMBS offering period, Abernathy received 
  4  internal monthly reports showing that 12%   to 18%  ofa random sample   of IndyMac 
  5  Bank's  loans contained misrepresentations regarding important information about 
  6  the loans'  characteristics (such as a loan's  status as an owner-occupied loan or its 
  7  loan-to-value ("LTV") ratio) and/or the borrowers'  creditworthiness (such as a 
  8  borrower's  identity, income, or debt load).  Despite receiving those monthly 
  9  reports showing that a significant percentage of loans contained 
 10   misrepresentations, Abernathy negligently failed to take reasonable or responsible 
 11   steps to ensure that the RMBS offering documents, which had been prepared by 
 12   inside and outside counsel, included accurate disclosures concerning the loans in 
 13   the RMBS or notified investors that the presented information was materially 
 14   misleading in light of IndyMac Bank's  monthly reports.  Abernathy authorized 
 15   and/or signed Commission filings relating to these offerings.  These six offerings 
 16   have experienced substantial loan delinquencies and ratings downgrades. 
 17   B.	   False and Misleading Statements  Regarding IndyMac's Deteriorating 
 18         Financial Condition in 2008 Stock Sales 
 19         6.    In 2008, Abernathy was negligent in not knowing that IndyMac's 
 20  offering documents for stock sales through the Direct Stock Purchase Program 
 21   ("DSPP") contained false and misleading disclosures concerning IndyMac's 
 22  financial condition.  Although Abernathy regularly received information regarding 
 23   IndyMac's  deteriorating financial condition, Abernathy negligently failed to take 
 24  steps to disclose this infonnation to investors.  Instead, he authorized IndyMac's 
.	 25 common stock offering materials that made false and misleading statements 
 26  regarding IndyMac's  liquidity position and IndyMac's  need  to raise capital to keep 
 27  IndyMac Bank "well capitalized."  IndyMac disclosed its liquidity problems in its

 1   Ql 2008 Fonn  10-Q, filed on May 12,2008.  In July 2008, IndyMac Bank was put 
 2  into FDIC receivership and IndyMac declared bankruptcy. 
 3         7.    Based on his conduct, Defendant violated Sections  17(a)(2) and 
 4  17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933,15  U.S.C. §§ 77q(a)(2) and 77q(a)(3).  The 
 5  Commission seeks an order enjoining Defendant from future violations    of these 
 6  provisions, ordering Defendant to pay a civil monetary penalty, requiring 
 7  Defendant to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and providing 
 8  other appropriate relief. 
 9                                 THE DEFENDANT 
10         8.    S. Blair Abernathy  is a resident of La Verne, California.  He began 
11   working for IndyMac Bank in 1994 and was its Executive Vice President in charge 
12   of four groups:  Secondary Marketing  (1994-2004); Investment Portfolio Group 
13   (2004-March 2007); Specialty Lending (March 2007 to November 2007); and 
14   Capital Markets (November 2007-ApriI25,  2008).  Abernathy became IndyMac's 
15   Chief Financial Officer on April 25, 2008 and held that position until July 2008. 
16   Abernathy was licensed as a CPA in California until his license was cancelled in 
17   2003, due to non-renewal by Abernathy.  Abernathy was also Executive Vice 
18   President and a member  of the Board of Directors of IndyMac MBS, Inc., the 
19   depositor for the relevant RMBS  offerings. 
20                                RELATED  PARTIES 
21         9.    IndyMac was a Delaware  corporation with principal executive offices 
22  in Pasadena, California.  Its common stock was registered with the Commission 
23   pursuant to Section  12(b) of the Exchange Act and traded on the NYSE until 
24  August 18, 2008, when it was delisted and withdrawn from registration pursuant to 
25   Rule 12d2-2(b) of the Exchange Act.  Its common stock is currently quoted on the 
26  Pink Sheets operated  by OTC Markets Group, Inc.  IndyMac filed for Chapter 7 
27  bankruptcy  on July 31,2008.

 1         10.   IndyMac Bank was a federally-chartered thrift institution regulated by 
 2  the Office ofThrift Supervision ("OTS") and headquartered in Pasadena, 
 3  California.  The OTS closed IndyMac Bank on July   11, 2008, and it was placed 
 4  under FDIC receivership. 
 5         11.   IndyMac MBS, Inc. was a Delaware corporation that was a limited 
 6  purpose finance subsidiary of Bank.  IndyMac MBS was the depositor for the 
 7  relevant RMBS offerings, which totaled approximately $2.5 billion. 
 8                                       FACTS 
 9  A.     Background 
10         12.   At the end of 2007, IndyMac was a publicly traded company with two 
11   primary operating segments:  mortgage banking, which originated, purchased, 
12   traded and serviced mortgage loans; and thrift, which invested in residential loans 
13   andRMBS. 
14         13.   IndyMac Bank acquired most   of its loans through relationships with 
15   mortgage brokers or other financial institutions and sold most of them to third 
16  parties, primarily through RMBS offerings and whole loan sales.  IndyMac Bank 
17   conducted RMBS offerings under IndyMac MBS' s shelf registration statements 
18  and through Government Sponsored Enterprises ("GSE") such    as Fannie Mae and 
19   Freddie Mac. 
20  B.     False and Misleading  Statements  in IndyMac   Bank's RMBS Offerings 
21         1.    IndyMac   Bank's  Securitization of Conduit Loans 
22         14.   IndyMac Bank's  Conduit Division accounted for 20%   of IndyMac's 
23  $78 billion loan production in 2007 by purchasing loans in bulk from third-party 
24  originators.  Abernathy was involved with the Conduit Division until August 2007 
25  when it was shut down.  He was also an Executive Vice President and a member   of 
26  the board of directors of IndyMac MBS, the IndyMac Bank subsidiary that 
27  conducted the Bank's·RMBS offerings.

---------------------Page 6---------------------

 1         15.    From May to December 2007, IndyMac Bank sold about $13.9 billion 
 2   in RMBS through offering documents,  that is, shelf registration statements on 
 3'  Form S-3, a prospectus, and a prospectus  supplement.  From May through August 
 4   2007, IndyMac Bank conducted six RMBS offerings totaling $2.5 billion 
 5  securitizing Conduit Division loans.  As alleged below, the offering documents for 
 6  these six offerings contained materially false and misleading information regarding 
 7  the quality of the loans underlying the RMBS. 
 8         2.     IndyMac's   False and  Misleading  RMBS Disclosures 
 9                a)    Loan  Quality:   IndyMac's   PPQC   Reports 
10         16.    From 1994 to August 2007, IndyMac Bank's  Post Production Quality 
11   Control ("PPQC") unit performed monthly quality control audits    of the Bank's 
12   loan production.  Each month, PPQC selected a statistically valid random sample 
13   of the Bank's  total loan production and assessed each loan to determine whether 
14   the borrower or a third party, such as the mortgage broker or appraiser, 
15   misrepresented  information in obtaining the loan.  The misrepresentation 
16   categories identified by PPQC were: 
17                a.    Occupancy-the     loan documents stated that the home was the 
18                      borrower's  primary residence when it actually was a second 
19                      home or investment property.  Borrowers are more likely to 
20                      repay a loan ifthey live in the home. 
21                b.    Appraisal-the   appraisal stated an inflated home value. An 
22                      inflated appraisal lowers the loan-to-value ("LTV") ratio of a 
23                      loan, so it appears to carry less risk. 
24                c.    Income-the    borrower's  income was overstated to show more 

25                      cash flow to make loan payments   (e.g., a flooring installer with 
26                      a stated income of$13,500  per month).  The more a borrower's 
27                      income is overstated,  the greater the risk ofdefault. 
28 

                                              5 
---------------------Page 7---------------------

 1               d.	    Employment-the     borrower's  work status was inaccurate (e.g., 
 2                      the borrower claimed that he worked for trucking company but 
 3                      had quit nine months earlier). If a borrower's  employment (and 
 4                      hence, income) is misstated, the greater the risk of default. 
 5                e.	   Assets-the  borrower's  assets were overstated to show greater 
 6                      resources to make loan payments   (e.g., borrower claimed 
 7                      $29,000 in saving account when there was $0).  The more a 
 8                      borrower's  assets are overstated, the greater the risk of default. 
 9                f.	   Credit (undisclosed liabilities)-the loan application did not 
10                      disclose the borrower's  existing or in-process debts, which 
11                      reduced the borrower's  debt load (e.g., the borrower obtained 
12                      loans on two properties from different banks).  The greater a 
13                      borrower's  debts, the greater the risk of default. 
14                g.	   Transaction ("straw  buyer '')-a borrower with good credit 
15                      obtained a loan for a relative with poor credit.  Again, to the 
16                      extent the true identity, employment and credit history of a 
17                      borrower is concealed, the greater the risk of default. 
18         17.   Before making a misrepresentation finding, PPQC developed actual 
19   proof that information on the loan application was false.  For example, PPQC did 
20  not make an employment misrepresentation finding unless the borrower admitted 
21   that the information was false or the employer confirmed that the borrower did not 
22  work there.  An  appraisal misrepresentation was the only category that might 
23   involve judgment rather than definitive proof.  PPQC, however, gave each 
24  mortgage production unit, including Conduit, the opportunity to dispute any 
25   finding before it became final.  Conduit disagreed with PPQC's  findings, including 
26  appraisals, approximately 2%   of the time. 
27         18.    IfPPQC  identified a loan misrepresentation, it recalculated the loan's 
28   estimated lifetime loan loss using the corrected information.  PPQC then 

                                              6 
---------------------Page 8---------------------

 1  determined the increase in the loss estimate between the loan as underwritten and 
 2   as corrected.  PPQC rated the estimated loan loss as "severe" if it had a 
 3  misrepresentation finding and the loss estimate increased by more than  50 basis 
 4  points.  PPQC also rated a loan "severe"  if it had an underwriting error and an 
 5  increase in the loss estimate greater than both 100% and 100 basis points.  PPQC 
 6  rated loans as "moderate"  if the loss estimate increased by up to 50 basis points 
 7  and was based on a loan misrepresentation, or increased by both 50%   to 100% and 
 8   50 to 100 basis points and was based on an underwriting error.  In addition to the 
 9  severe and moderate rates, PPQC reported the "defect" rate, which were the 
10   "severe" and "moderate" rates combined. 
11         19.   PPQC prepared monthly audit reports and distributed them 
12   approximately three to four months after the audited month.  The reports: 
13                a.	   First, had an "Executive Summary" that: 
14                      1.	   Stated the sample's  defect rate-which  ranged from 10% 
15                            to 22% from September 2005 through August 2007; 
16                     11.	   Compared the stated defect rate to prior periods; and 
17                     111.	  Stated the percentage of loans that contained 
18                            misrepresentations - which ranged from 12%    to 18% 
19                            from January 2007 (when reporting   of that statistic 
20                            began) through August 2007. 
21               b.	    Second, presented a chart that broke down the findings by 
22                      business unit, including Conduit, which had a defect rate of up 
23                      to 30% from April 2005 through August 2007. 
24               c.	    Third, attached spreadsheets that provided loan-by-Ioan detail 
25                      ofPPQC's   findings with supporting reasons and the response of 
26                      the business unit responsible for the loan. 
27         20.   PPQC distributed the monthly reports bye-mail  and posted them on 
28  IndyMac's intranet site.  Abernathy received hardcopy and/or electronic copies  of 

                                              7

 1  the reports and was also aware that the reports were available on IndyMac's 
 2  intranet. 
 3               b)    IndyMac   Bank's  False and  Misleading  Statements 
 4                     Regarding   Loan  Quality 
 5         21.   In mid 2007, IndyMac conducted six RMBS offerings through 
 6  IndyMac IMSC Mortgage Loan Trust ("IMSC") securitizing only Conduit loans: 
 7
 8                RMBS  Offering      Settlement  Date    Amount   Offered 
 9
                   IMSC 2007-Fl          5/29/2007          $274 million 
10
11                IMSC 2007-AR1          6/28/2007          $675 million 

12
                   IMSC 2007-F2          6/28/2007          $330 million 
13
                 IMSC 2007-HOA1          6/29/2007          $425 million 
14
15
                  IMSC 2007-AR2          7/30/2007          $307 million 
16
17                 IMSC 2007-F3          8/30/2007          $531 million 

18

19         22.   The registration statements for these RMBS offerings contained blank 
20  tables for the securitized loans to be summarized in the prospectus supplements. 
21  The loan information included the LTV, occupancy, borrower credit score, 
22  mortgage rate, loan type (e.g., full, limited, or no documentation), loan purpose 
23   (e.g., purchase or refinance), and original and outstanding principal balance, all of 
24  which was material information to a reasonable investor.  The prospectus 
25  supplements then populated these tables with information on the securitized loans. 
26  IndyMac Bank, however, populated the tables with the original information that it 
27  had on the loans.  From January to August 2007, however, the random samples   of 
28  IndyMac loans as set forth in the PPQC reports showed that, in 12% to 18%  of its 

                                             8
 
---------------------Page 10---------------------

 1  loans, the original infonnation  (such as that summarized in the tables) contained 
 2  misrepresentations.   As such, the infonnation provided in the Bank's  prospectus 
 3  supplements was false and misleading. 
 4         23.   The offering documents for each RMBS offering also stated that 
 5  IndyMac Bank would not include any loan in the offering    if anything came to its 
 6  attention causing it to believe that the loan contained a misrepresentation.  That 
 7  statement was false and misleading because the PPQC reports provided IndyMac 
 8  Bank reason to believe that 12% to 18%    of its loans, including loans underlying the 
 9  six offerings, contained misrepresentations. 
10         24.   The loan infonnation was material.  The quality  of the loans and the 
11   characteristics ofthe borrowers were key bases for detennining whether a loan 
12  would be repaid, whether a foreclosure would yield sufficient funds  ifthe borrower 
13   defaulted on the loan, and, thus, whether RMBS investors would receive their 
14  principal and interest payments.  Loan quality and borrower characteristics, 
15   therefore, had a significant bearing upon the risk of owning, and the value of, an 
16  RMBS. 
17         25.   Abernathy had significant responsibilities in connection with the six 
18   RMBS offerings at issue, including signing the Fonns S-3; reviewing, discussing, 
19  and participating in the structuring of each transaction; participating in setting the 
20  price for a proposed offering; and directly authorizing four of the six transactions. 
21   Despite receiving monthly PPQC reports showing that a significant percentage   of 
22  loans contained misrepresentations, Abernathy negligently failed to take 
23  reasonable  or responsible steps to ensure that the RMBS offering documents, 
24  which had been prepared by inside and outside counsel, included accurate 
25  disclosures concerning the loans in the RMBS or to notify investors that the 
26  presented infonnation was materially misleading in light  of IndyMac Bank's 
27   PPQC audit results.

 1  C.     IndyMac's   False and  Misleading  2008 Stock Sales 
 2         26.   On April 25, 2008, Abernathy became IndyMac's CFO after the 
 3  previous CFO left IndyMac on medical leave.    As  CFO, Abernathy supervised 
 4  IndyMac's  investor relations department, which managed IndyMac's  Direct Stock 
 5  Purchase Plan ("DSPP").  Under the DSPP, investors could purchase $10,000 or 
 6  more  of IndyMac's  common stock at a 1%    to 2.5% discount to market price. 
 7         27.   From April  25 through May 9,2008,  IndyMac raised approximately 
 8  $22.2 million through the DSPP pursuant   to a June 30,2006  Form  S-3 automatic 
 9  shelf registration statement and April 3 and May 2, 2008 prospectuses, which 
10   offering documents incorporated by reference periodic filings with the 
11   Commission. 
12         1.    IndyMac's   Prior  Commission  Filings 
13         28.   On February 12,2008,  IndyMac reported its 2007 results   of 
14   operations and financial condition in a Form 8-K ("2007 Earnings 8-K"), which 
15   included as exhibits an earnings press release (the "Press Release"), a shareholder 
16   letter (the "Shareholder Letter"), and a presentation entitled "IndyMac Bancorp, 
17   Inc. Fourth Quarter Review" (the "Presentation").  Although IndyMac 
18   acknowledged in those filings that it had a "terrible" 2007 and had lost $509 
19   million in the quarter just ended and $615 million during fiscal 2007, its Press 
20  Release informed investors that it had finished the quarter in a "solid overall 
21   financial position" and had a "game plan" that gave it a "realistic shot" at a $13 
22  million profit in 2008.  IndyMac further stated that even if its 2008 forecast was 
23   wrong, "we have the capital ...  to absorb nearly triple our presently forecasted 
24  2008 credit costs and fight our way through until the housing and mortgage 
25   markets do stabilize." 
26        . 29.   The 2007 Earnings 8-K also had positive forecasts for a metric critical 
27   to banks - the total risk-based capital ratio (the "capital.tatio") - which is a 
28  measure  of a bank's  safety and soundness and is calculated by dividing a bank's 

                                             10
 
---------------------Page 12---------------------

 1  total risk-based capital (e.g., shareholder equity) by total risk-weighted  assets (i.e., 
 2  the greater the presumed risk  of an asset, the greater the risk weighting  and the 
 3  reserved capital needed to support the asset). 
 4          30.   Under the  OTS's  regulations and 2000 order approving  IndyMac's 
 5  acquisition  of IndyMac Bank, IndyMac Bank was required to maintain a capital 
 6  ratio of 10% or more to be considered "well-capitalized."  IndyMac Bank would 
 7  suffer significant  regulatory consequences   if its capital ratio fell below the 10% 
 8  well-capitalized  threshold, including: 
 9                a.	    An inability to accept (without a waiver from the FDIC) 
10                       brokered deposits  (i.e., funds deposited by brokers for third 
11                       parties that receive higher interest rates), which would likely 
12                       curtail IndyMac  Bank's  lending business; 
13                b.	    Potentially increased costs, including borrowing costs from the 
14                       Federal Home Loan Bank, insurance premiums  to the FDIC, 
15                       and payments to the OTS; and 
16                c.	    The OTS and FDIC could impose various restrictions or 
17                       remedial requirements. 
18          31.   In the 2007 Earnings 8-K, IndyMac stated that IndyMac      Bank's 
19   capital ratio was 10.50% at the end  of 2007, and was thus above the 10% well­
20  capitalized threshold.  IndyMac went on to state that  "[w]e believe that, under 
21   current regulations, the bank will continue to meet its 'well-capitalized'  minimum 

22  capital requirements  in the foreseeable  future," and that "[w]e are currently 

23  forecasting that our balance sheet size will decline and our capital ratios will 

24  increase over the course  of 2008 as we execute our revised business model    of 
25  primarily GSE lending." 

26         32.   Indeed, the Shareholder Letter stated that the "only good news" was 
27  that, even with its significant annual and quarterly losses, IndyMac remained in a 

28  "fundamentally  sound financial position"  and that IndyMac    Bank's  "capital levels 

                                               11
 
---------------------Page 13---------------------

 1  continue to exceed the levels defined  as 'well capitalized' by our regulators."  The 
 2  letter informed IndyMac's investors that "based on our new business model      ... we 
 3  are forecasting a small profit in 2008 .,. as we believe we can maintain our 'well­
 4  capitalized'  capital ratios even under worsening industry conditions." 
 5         33.   The Presentation included in the 2007 Earnings 8-K projected that 
 6  IndyMac Bank would have a capital ratio    of 10.59% at March 31, 2008.  With 
 7  regard  to raising capital, the Shareholder Letter stated, "[W]e want to try and avoid 
 8  raising capital externally right now given our current stock price relative to book 
 9  value per share, as any capital raised would be highly dilutive to existing 
10   shareholders."  Similarly, the Presentation stated that "due to our low stock price to 
11   book value per share, our 2008 plan does not rely on the capital markets for raising 
12   capital; instead we plan to eliminate the dividend [on common shares] and shrink 
13   the balance sheet," thereby improving IndyMac's capital position   by $318 million. 
14         34.   The 2007 Earnings 8-K also discussed  IndyMac's  liquidity, including 
15   its cash position, stating that it had: 
16                a.	   $64 million in cash at year end 2007  to pay futUre preferred 
17                      dividends  of $7.3 million per quarter; 
18                b.	   "enough cash to pay [preferred dividends] for over 2 years 
19                      without any dividends from the Bank or additional debt or 
20                      equity raised"; and 
21                c.	   "the right to defer dividend payments on [preferred securities] 
22                      for up to five years; [but it did] not expect to have to exercise 
23                      this right." 
24         35.   IndyMac's capital and liquidity levels and its "realistic" plan to return 
25   to profitability in 2008 began to change just one week after it filed its 2007 
26  Earnings 8-K.  There was significant interest rate volatility in February 2008 which 
27  in tum adversely affected IndyMac Bank's  capital ratio on those days when 
28  interest rates rose.  On or about February 19, 2008, IndyMac learned that a 

                                              12
 
---------------------Page 14---------------------

 1  significant one-day rise in interest rates caused IndyMac Bank's  forecasted capital 
 2  ratio at March 31  to be right at or slightly under 10%. That same day, on 
 3  February  19, IndyMac began   to raise up to $50 million through new stock sales 
 4  through the DSPP.  IndyMac planned to use DSPP sales proceeds to keep the 
 5  Bank's capital ratio above 10% by contributing $25   to $50 million to IndyMac 
 6  Bank and to pay future preferred dividends.  All  of the DSPP sales at issue in this 
 7  Complaint were made to institutional investors who were seeking to arbitrage the 
 8  difference between the discounted price and the market price by selling their DSPP 
 9  shares into the public securities markets to capture the price difference. 
10         36.   On February 29,2008,  IndyMac filed its 2007 Form 10-K.  Although 
11   IndyMac's 2007 Form 10-K included many negative statements and acknowledged 
12   that "2007 was a terrible year for our industry, for IndyMac, and for you, our 
13   owners," it also repeated many of the positive statements in its 2007 Earnings 8-K, 
14   including:  "We have a solid and a realistic plan that we believe will return 
15   IndyMac to profitability in 2008."  The 2007 Form 10-K also made positive 
16   disclosures regarding IndyMac's current liquidity and capital needs: 
17               a.     "We currently believe our liquidity level is sufficient to satisfy 
18                      our operating requirements and meet our obligations and 
19                      commitments in a timely and cost effective manner"; 
20               b.     "As a result of our ... strong capital and liquidity positions, we 
21                      were not forced to sell assets at liquidation prices and our [loan] 
22                      funding capacity was not materially impacted"; and 
23               c.     While Bank "currently [has] regulatory capital ratios in excess 
24                      of the 'well capitalized'  requirement and [has] implemented a 
25                      plan to ... increase our capital ratios, there can be no assurance 
26                      that [Bank] will not suffer material losses or that [IndyMac's] 
27                      plans .,. will succeed.  In those circumstances, [IndyMac] may

                                              13

 1                     be required to seek additional regulatory capital to maintain our 
 2                     capital ratios at the 'well capitalized'  level." 
 3         37.   These statements were false and misleading when IndyMac filed its 
 4  2007 Form 10-K.  IndyMac's capital position was not "strong" because IndyMac 
 5  Bank's capital ratio was projected to be right at or slightly below 10%. 
 6  Furthermore, IndyMac's liquidity position was weakening and it needed to raise 
 7  new capital to protect its well-capitalized regulatory status and to pay preferred 
 8  dividends in future quarters. 
 9         38.   On March 31,2008,  IndyMac made a $70 million capital contribution 
10  to IndyMac Bank for the principal purpose  of protecting the Bank's  capital ratio. 
11  After the $70 million capital contribution on March 31, 2008, IndyMac was left 
12   with about $21 million in cash, which was enough to pay three quarters of 
13  preferred dividends without raising additional capital or receiving dividends from 
14   IndyMac Bank. 
15         39.   On April 3, 2008, IndyMac filed a prospectus registering the offer of 
16   an additional ten million common shares through the DSPP.  The prospectus stated 
17  that IndyMac "intend[ed] to use the net proceeds from [the offering] for general 
18   corporate purposes, including investment in our subsidiaries" and incorporated 
19   disclosures in IndyMac's 2007 Earnings 8-K and 2007 Form 10-K regarding 
20  IndyMac's strong capital and liquidity positions. 
21         40.   IndyMac's capital·and liquidity positions deteriorated even further in 
22  late April 2008, when Moody's  Investors Service downgraded    165 MBS bonds 
23   sponsored by IndyMac Bank on April 23, and Standard    & Poor's  downgraded  251 
24  IndyMac Bank-sponsored MBS bonds on April 28.  IndyMac Bank held on its 
25  balance sheet $160 million in downgraded bonds as   of March 31, 2008 and 
26  recorded a $9.5 million write-down expense during the quarter ended March 31, 
27  thereby lowering IndyMac Bank's  first quarter 2008 capital ratio.  In addition, the 
28  bond rating downgrades also negatively impacted IndyMac Bank's  capital ratio in 

                                             14
 
---------------------Page 16---------------------

 1  future quarters because additional capital was required to support the downgraded, 
 2  and hence riskier, bonds. 
 3         41.   On April 25, 2008, shortly after the first bond downgrade, Abernathy 
 4  became IndyMac's CFO after the previous CFO left IndyMac on medical leave. 
 5         42.   After the bond downgrades, IndyMac had    no choice but to suspend 
 6  preferred dividends as a way to conserve cash.  It was also clear that the 
 7  downgrades could drive IndyMac Bank's capital ratio below    10%  at March 31, and 
 8  that IndyMac would not have sufficient cash to both keep IndyMac Bank's  capital 
 9  ratio above 10% and pay future preferred dividends. 
10         43.   Abernathy negligently failed to disclose (either through a new 
11   prospectus, an amendment to the April 3, 2008 prospectus, or a Form 8-K) that 
12   IndyMac planned to use the DSPP net offering proceeds for a capital contribution 
13   to IndyMac Bank and to pay future preferred dividends, see Item 504 of 
14   Regulation S-K  ofthe Securities Act, 17 C.F.R. § 229.504 (prospectus required to 
15   disclose "the principal purposes for which the net proceeds to the registrant from 
16   the securities to be offered are intended to be used and the approximate amount 
17   intended to be used for each such purpose."), and that the April bond rating 
18   downgrades jeopardized IndyMac Bank's  "well-capitalized" status such that 
19   IndyMac would need to conserve cash   by suspending future preferred dividends. 
20  The impact  of the bond ratings downgrades  to IndyMac's capital and liquidity 
21   would have been material information to reasonable investors'  assessment of their 
22  risk of loss and their valuation of IndyMac stock offered through the DSPP. 
23         44.   From April  25 through May  2, 2008, when it filed a new DSPP 
24  prospectus: IndyMac raised approximately $12.8 million through the DSPP. 
25         2.    IndyMac's  False  and  Misleading  May  2, 2008 Prospectus 
26         45.   By May 2,2008,  it was clear that IndyMac would have to suspend 
27  future preferred dividend payments as a result ofthe continuing decline in 
28  IndyMac's  liquidity and capital positions. 

                                             15 
---------------------Page 17---------------------

 1         46.   On May 2,2008,  IndyMac filed with the Commission a new 
 2  prospectus registering the offer of another ten million common shares.  Abernathy 
 3  authorized the filing of the May 2 prospectus.  This prospectus again stated that 
 4  IndyMac "intend[ed]   to use the net proceeds from [the offering] for general 
 5  corporate purposes, including investment in our subsidiaries."  By incorporating by 
 6  reference the 2007 Earnings 8-K and 2007 Form 10-K, the May 2 prospectus 
 7  repeated those earlier filings' statements regarding IndyMac' s strong capital and 
 8  liquidity positions, its cash holdings being sufficient to pay future preferred 
 9  dividends for over two years, and its positive forecasts for the Bank's capital ratio. 
10         47.   From May 3 through May 9,2008,  IndyMac raised $9.4 million 
11   through the DSPP.  May 9 was the last trading day before May 12, when IndyMac 
12   filed its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2008 and all DSPP sales 
13   ended. 
14         48.   The DSPP offering's  specific purpose was  to raise capital to protect 
15   IndyMac Bank's capital ratio.  In addition, contrary to the disclosures in the 2007 
16   Earnings 8-K and 2007 Form 10-K, IndyMac's  liquidity position had deteriorated 
17   as a result ofIndyMac' s $70 million cash contribution to the Bank on March 31 
18   such that IndyMac would have to suspend future preferred dividend payments, and 
19   IndyMac Bank's  capital ratio was close to the 10% "well-capitalized" threshold as 
20   a result of the bond downgrades in April.  Abernathy negligently failed to take 
21   steps to disclose this information to investors until May 12,2008, when IndyMac 
22  filed its Forms 10-Q and 8-K, which disclosed, among other things, the suspension 
23   of future preferred dividends and that IndyMac Bank's  capital ratio would have 
24  been 9.27%   if the risk-weighting impact of the April bond downgrades had been 
25   required to have been recorded as ofMarch 31.  Such information would have been 
26  material to investors, as they would have viewed the true reasons for IndyMac's 
27   stock sales and its declining capital and liquidity levels as important to their 
28   assessment of their risk of loss and the price for IndyMac's  common stock.  On
