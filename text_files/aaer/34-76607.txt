       In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondents have submitted an

purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the 
findings herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over them and the subject matter of 
these proceedings, which are admitted, and except as provided herein in Section V, Respondents 
consent to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, 
Pursuant to Sections 4C and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 102(e) of the 
Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a

                                                 III. 
 
                                                                                      3
       On the basis of this Order and Respondents’ Offer, the Commission finds         that:  
 
A.     SUMMARY 
        
       Messineo & Co. is a small, Florida-based accounting firm.  Among other things, it has 
performed audits of public companies whose stock is registered with the Commission and who 
file audited financial statements with the Commission.  Messineo is a partner at and majority 
owner of Messineo & Co.  Messineo & Co. and Messineo performed deficient audits of public 
company clients, which caused those clients to file misleading audited financial statements with 
the Commission.  To cover up their deficiencies, certain employees of Messineo & Co. 
backdated and falsified its audit documentation.  Messineo also performed sub-standard 
engagement quality reviews for another auditor.  In late 2012, Messineo effectively merged his 

                                                 
2
       Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) provides, in pertinent part, that: 
 
               The Commission may . . . deny, temporarily or permanently, the privilege of appearing or 
               practicing before it . . . to any person who is found . . . to have engaged in unethical or improper 
               professional conduct. 
 
       Rule 102(e)(1)(iii) provides, in pertinent part, that: 
 
               The Commission may . . . deny, temporarily or permanently, the privilege of appearing or 
               practicing before it . . . to any person who is found…to have willfully violated, or willfully aided 
               and abetted the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or the rules and 
               regulations thereunder. 
 
3
       The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondents’ Offer of Settlement and are not binding on any 
       other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

firm with another firm to form DKM Certified Public Accountants, Inc. (“DKM”).  The merger 
exacerbated Respondents’ on-going violations of the independence rules for accountants 
involving DKM’s clients and Messineo.  Prior to the merger, Messineo had been the chief 
financial officer (“CFO”) of two of DKM’s clients and concurrently the employer of a partner on 
DKM’s audit engagement team.  After the merger, Messineo was a shareholder of two of DKM’s 
clients and DKM was auditing Messineo’s work.  Lastly, Messineo failed to timely file with the 
Commission Forms 3, 4, or 5 and Schedule 13Ds detailing his beneficial ownership of stock in 
these audit clients.   
        
       As a result, Messineo & Co. and Messineo violated auditing standards and independence 
rules, caused issuers to file misstatements, and failed to disclose his beneficial ownership.  In 
addition, Messineo falsely certified annual and quarterly reports as chief financial officer of two 
issuers.  Respondents’ conduct violated the Federal securities laws and the rules and regulations 
thereunder.  Respondents’ conduct was willful and constitutes improper professional conduct.     
        
B.     RESPONDENTS 
 
       Messineo & Co., CPAs, LLC (“Messineo & Co.”) is registered with the Public 
Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) as a public accounting firm based in 
Clearwater, Florida.  The limited liability company operated as a sole proprietorship under the 
name Peter Messineo, CPA from 2009 until December 17, 2012, when it effectively merged with 
Drake & Klein, CPAs PA (“Drake & Klein”) to form DKM Certified Public Accountants, Inc. 
(“DKM”).  Peter Messineo separated from DKM in April 2013 and began operating Messineo & 
Co. again, but under its present name and form.  During 2012, Messineo & Co. performed audit 
services for over 70 clients, but only had one partner -- sole owner Peter Messineo -- authorized 
to sign or issue audit reports.  In 2012, Messineo & Co. employed Robin Bigalke and Richard 
Confessore and paid Joseph E. Mohr to perform engagement quality reviews (“EQRs”).   
        
       Peter Messineo, age 54, resides in Palm Harbor, Florida and is currently a partner at and 
95% owner of Messineo & Co.  In 2012, he was the sole owner of Messineo & Co. (then named 
“Peter Messineo, CPA”) and CFO of Issuer A and Issuer B (described below).  From December 
17, 2012 to April 16, 2013, Messineo was a partner and one third owner of DKM and a 
shareholder of Issuer A and Issuer B stock.   Messineo has been licensed as a certified public 
accountant (“CPA”) in New York since 1989 and in Florida since 2007.   
        
C.     OTHER RELEVANT PARTIES 
 
       DKM Certified Public Accountants, Inc. (“DKM”) is a PCAOB-registered public 
accounting firm based in Clearwater, Florida.  DKM is a Florida corporation and successor to 
audit firms:  (i) Drake Klein & Messineo CPAs PA and (ii) Drake & Klein.  In December 2012, 
when Peter Messineo joined DKM, the firm changed its operational name from Drake & Klein to 
DKM.  From December 2012 through April 2013, DKM had four partners authorized to issue 
audit reports on behalf of the firm, including:  Messineo, Confessore, and Charles Klein.

       Ronald R. Chadwick, P.C. (“Chadwick”) was a PCAOB-registered public accounting 
firm based in Aurora, CO.  From at least September 2010 through October 2013, Messineo 
performed engagement quality reviews of audits conducted by Chadwick.  In April 2015, the 
PCAOB revoked Chadwick’s registration and has barred Mr. Ronald Chadwick from being an 
associated person of a registered public accounting firm.  The PCAOB imposed those sanctions 
on the basis of its findings of violations of the PCAOB’s rules and auditing standards in 
connection with the audits of financial statements of five issuer clients for which Messineo 
provided the engagement quality review.      

       Richard Confessore, age 73, resides in Sarasota, Florida and has been a licensed CPA in 
Florida since 1970.  Confessore is currently a “Quality Review Partner” at DKM.  During 2011, 
Confessore was the CFO and worked at Issuer C Corporation.  During 2012-2013, Confessore 
performed engagement quality reviews for the annual audits and interim reviews DKM 
performed for Issuers A and B.  In addition, from June 2012 – December 2012, Confessore was 
an employee for Messineo & Co, then a sole proprietorship owned by Peter Messineo.   

       Charles U. Klein, age 60, resides in Dunedin, Florida and is currently President of 
DKM.  From approximately February 2012 through June 2013, Klein was the lead engagement 
partner for the services DKM performed for Issuer A and Issuer B, including annual audits and 
interim reviews of Issuer B’s and Issuer A’s financial statements.  Klein has been a licensed CPA 
in Florida since 1985, excluding 1995 to 1998 when his license was inactive. 

       Joseph E. Mohr, age 49, resides in Spring Hill, Florida and is currently an assistant 
professor at a Florida university.  From 2009 through 2012, Messineo & Co. hired Mohr to 
perform EQRs.  At the time, Mohr lived and worked in Florida, but was not licensed as a CPA in 
Florida or in any other state. 
 
       Issuer A was incorporated in Delaware in 2005 and is currently headquartered in California.  
During 2012 and 2013, Issuer A’s common stock was registered with the Commission pursuant to 
Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act.  In its most recent Form 10-K filed with the Commission, 
Issuer A states that its business offers marketing tools and expertise to advertisers.  From February 
2010 through November 2012, Messineo served as CFO of Issuer A.  In 2012 and 2013, Issuer A 
engaged Drake & Klein and then DKM to perform audit services.       
        
       Issuer B was incorporated in Nevada in 2004 and is currently headquartered in St. 
Petersburg, FL.  During 2012 and 2013, Issuer B’s common stock was registered with the 
Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act.  In its most recent Form 10-K filed 
with the Commission, Issuer B states that its business “creates a unified solution path to securely 
manage Advanced Metering Infrastructure and other Smart Grid optimization applications such as 
substation and distribution automation.”  From September 2010 through October 2012, Messineo 
served as CFO of Issuer B.  In 2012 and 2013, Issuer B engaged Drake & Klein and then DKM to 
perform audit services. 

       Issuer C was incorporated in Colorado in 1981.  Currently, it is a Florida corporation 
headquartered in Southbury, CT.  During 2012 and 2013, Issuer C’s common stock was registered 

                                               4 
                                                
---------------------Page 5---------------------

with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act.  In its most recent Form 10-K 
filed with the Commission, Issuer C states that its business consists of “operating motor freight 
carriers, providing truck load service throughout the forty-eight contiguous United States.”  
Confessore resigned as CFO of Issuer C on April 12, 2011.  In 2012, Issuer C engaged Messineo & 
Co. to provide audit services.  Messineo & Co. did not complete its audit or issue an audit report 
before the formation of DKM.  In 2013, Issuer C engaged DKM to provide audit services for the 
same period for which Messineo & Co. had been engaged.  
 
D.     MESSINEO & CO. AND MESSINEO ENGAGED IN IMPROPER 
       PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT BY CONDUCTING AUDITS AND REVIEWS NOT 
       IN ACCORDANCE WITH PCAOB STANDARDS. 
 
   1.     During 2011 and 2012, Messineo & Co. -- at Messineo’s direction -- issued audit 
          reports to at least 13 issuers without first obtaining the required engagement quality 
          review (“EQR”) and concurring approval in violation of PCAOB auditing standards.  
           
   2.     PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 7 (Engagement Quality Review) (“AS 7”) enumerates 
          the standards for an EQR or concurring review.  An EQR is required for every audit 
          of an annual report and review of interim financial information for a quarterly report.  
          See PCAOB AS 7.1. 
           
   3.     PCAOB AS 7 provides that “[i]n an audit, the firm may grant permission to the client 
          to use the engagement report only after the engagement quality reviewer provides 
          concurring approval of issuance” and “[i]n a review of interim financial information, 
          the firm may grant permission to the client to use the engagement report (or 
          communicate an engagement conclusion to its client, if no report is issued) only after 
          the engagement quality reviewer provides concurring approval of issuance.”  See 
          PCAOB AS 7.13 and AS 7.18. 
 
   4.     For some of the 13 engagements, Messineo requested an EQR from Joseph Mohr 
          after he had already issued the audit report.  For other engagements, Messineo 
          requested the EQR before he issued the audit report, but failed to wait for Mohr to 
          respond before issuing the audit report and granting permission to use it. 
 
   5.     For at least one engagement, Messineo & Co. issued an audit report without even 
          soliciting an EQR because it erroneously deemed EQRs “unnecessary” for clients 
          who were “blank check” companies.   
 
   6.     By issuing audit reports to the 13 issuers without an EQR and concurring approval, 
          Messineo & Co. violated PCAOB standards.  See PCAOB AS 7.

---------------------Page 6---------------------

E.     RESPONDENTS VIOLATED RULE 2-02 OF REGULATION S-X BECAUSE 
       MESSINEO & CO’S AUDIT REPORTS DID NOT COMPLY WITH PCAOB 
       STANDARDS. 
    
   7.     Rule 2-02(b)(1) of Regulation S-X (Representations as to the Audit included in 
          Accountants’ Reports) requires an accountant’s report to state “whether the audit was 
          made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.”  17 CFR §210.2-
          02(b).  These standards include the standards of the PCAOB. “[R]eferences in 
          Commission rules and staff guidance and in the federal securities laws to [generally 
          accepted auditing standards “GAAS”] or to specific standards under GAAS, as they 
          related to issuers, should be understood to mean the standards of the PCAOB plus any 
          applicable rules of the Commission.”  See SEC Release No. 34-49708. 
           
   8.     Messineo & Co.’s audit reports for each of these 13 engagements inaccurately stated 
          that Messineo & Co. had “conducted [its] audit in accordance with the standards of 
          the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).”  
        
   9.     In fact, Messineo & Co.’s audits were not conducted in accordance with PCAOB 
          auditing standards because they lacked an EQR and concurring approval of issuance.  
          See PCAOB AS 7.1 and AS 7.13.  
        
   10.    Accordingly, Messineo & Co. violated and Messineo aided and abetted and caused a 
          violation of Rule 2-02 of Regulation S-X.  
        
F.     RESPONDENTS’ CONDUCT CAUSED VIOLATIONS OF EXCHANGE ACT 
       SECTIONS 13(a) AND 15(d) AND RULES 13a-1 AND 15d-1 THEREUNDER. 
        
   11.    Exchange Act Sections 13(a) and 15(d) and Rules 13a-1 and 15d-1 require an issuer 
          to file accurate annual reports on Form 10-K.  
           
   12.    As detailed above, Messineo & Co. and Messineo issued false audit reports to at least 
          13 issuers because they lacked an EQR and concurring approval of issuance.  Twelve 
          of the 13 issuers were required to file annual statements under Sections 13(a) and 
          15(d).  In accordance with Messineo & Co.’s and Messineo’s expectations, the 12 
          issuers incorporated the false audit reports into their respective annual reports (Form 
          10-Ks) filed with the Commission.  As a result, the issuers’ annual reports contained 
          material misstatements because they included false audit reports that lacked an EQR 
          and concurring approval of issuance.            
        
   13.    Messineo & Co. and Messineo, therefore, caused at least 12 different issuers to 
          violate Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 15d-1 
          thereunder.   
        

                                             6

G.     RESPONDENTS ENGAGED IN IMPROPER PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT BY 
       FALSIFYING RECORDS AND BACKDATING DOCUMENTS. 
        
   14.    The PCAOB had issued an inspection report to Messineo & Co. in April 2012 and 
          notified Messineo that it was going to conduct another inspection approximately 12 
          months following its report.    
           
   15.    In August 2012, Messineo directed Messineo & Co. personnel to review its audit files 
          to identify and correct deficiencies in its audit documentation.  Because Messineo had 
          issued engagement reports without concurring approval, deficiencies existed in 
          Messineo & Co.’s EQR documentation.   
        
   16.    PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 7 requires that documentation of an EQR should 
          “contain sufficient information to enable an experienced auditor, having no previous 
          connection with the engagement, to understand the procedures performed by the 
          engagement quality reviewer…to comply with the provisions of this standard, 
          including information that identifies: 
        
                                      *      *      * 
                     c.  The date the engagement quality reviewer provided concurring 
                     approval of issuance or, if no concurring approval of issuance was 
                     provided, the reasons for not providing the approval. 
           
          See PCAOB AS 7.19. 
           
   17.    PCAOB AS 7 also states that “[d]ocumentation of an engagement quality review 
          should be included in the engagement documentation” and that “[t]he requirements 
          related to retention of and subsequent changes to audit documentation in PCAOB 
          Auditing Standard No. 3, Audit Documentation, apply with respect to the 
          documentation of the engagement quality review.”  See PCAOB AS 7.20 and 7.21. 
           
   18.    PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 3 (Audit Documentation) (“AS 3”) provides the 
          requirements for documentation an auditor should prepare and retain for 
          engagements.  Per PCAOB AS 3, audit documentation must document the nature, 
          timing, and results of the procedures performed.  See PCAOB AS 3.6. 
           
   19.    PCAOB AS 3 requires an auditor to assemble a complete and final set of audit 
          documentation no more than 45 days after the report release date (“documentation 
          completion date”).  Audit documentation may not be deleted or discarded following 
          the documentation completion date.  PCAOB AS 3 mandates that any documentation 
          added after the document completion date “must indicate the date the information was 
          added, the name of the person who prepared the additional documentation, and the 
          reason for adding it.”  See PCAOB AS 3.15 and AS 3.16.

20.    To document EQRs, Messineo & Co. used a “Concurring Review Questionnaire,” 
       otherwise known as a “Form 4.2.”    
        
21.    After completing an EQR, the engagement quality reviewer–typically Mohr–was 
       supposed to answer the questions on the Concurring Review Questionnaire and then 
       sign and date the Questionnaire.  The date on the form was to indicate when Mohr 
       provided concurring approval of the issuance of the audit report.  Messineo had no 
       other system of tracking when Mohr completed an EQR other than the Form 4.2.       
    
22.    Mohr then emailed the signed forms to Messineo & Co. where the executed 
       Concurring Review Questionnaires were included within the firm’s audit files. 
    
23.    Beginning in August 2012, Messineo & Co. identified many engagements for which 
       either: 
    
          a.     it was missing a Concurring Review Questionnaire signed by Mohr; or 
                   
          b.     the signed Concurring Review Questionnaire was dated after the audit 
                  report had been issued by Messineo & Co., indicating that Messineo & 
                  Co. had issued the audit report prior to Mohr’s completion of his EQR. 
    
24.    As a result, Messineo & Co. personnel under Messineo’s general supervision 
       requested Mohr backdate his signature on Concurring Review Questionnaires for 
       multiple public company audit clients.   
        
25.    Mohr complied with many–if not all–of Messineo & Co.’s requests.  He knowingly 
       misrepresented the dates that he completed his EQRs. 
    
26.    Messineo & Co. personnel then inserted the backdated Concurring Review 
       Questionnaires into Messineo & Co.’s audit files, including into files which should 
       have been–pursuant to auditing standards–closed because the audit report had been 
       issued more than 45 days earlier.   
    
27.    In addition, in connection with audits of two clients, Messineo & Co. personnel 
       completed at some time various audit checklists and forms, including “Audit 
       Documentation Checklists” and “Supervision, Review, and Approval Forms.”   
    
28.    On the forms, Messineo & Co.’s audit manager signed Peter Messineo’s name and 
       initials on his behalf thereby certifying that the EQRs for those two audits were 
       timely and adequately performed and that the audit files contained documentation of 
       the EQRs. Those representations were false.  As of the date indicated on the 
       respective forms, Mohr had not performed the EQRs for those two audits.  These 
       false documents were included within Messineo & Co.’s audit files.

---------------------Page 9---------------------

   29.    The backdating and falsification of audit documentation and the insertion of the false 
          documents into Messineo & Co.’s audit files constitutes violations of PCAOB AS 3 
          and PCAOB AU 230 (Due Professional Care in the Performance of Work).  
        
   30.    PCAOB Interim Auditing Standard AU 230 “requires the independent auditor to plan 
          and perform his or her work with due professional care. Due professional care 
          imposes a responsibility upon each professional within an independent auditor's 
          organization to observe the standards of field work and reporting.”  See PCAOB AU 
          230.02. 
        
H.    MESSINEO ENGAGED IN IMPROPER PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT WHEN 
       HE CONDUCTED ENGAGEMENT QUALITY REVIEWS FOR AN ANOTHER 
       AUDITOR IN CONTRAVENTION OF PCAOB STANDARDS.  
 
   31.    From approximately September 2010 until October 2013, Messineo functioned as 
          Ronald Chadwick’s engagement quality reviewer.  He consented to the issuance of 
          over 130 audit reports for over 80 different Chadwick issuer clients during that 
          period.  For at least 5 of these engagements, Messineo conducted substandard 
          reviews. 
           
   32.    PCAOB AS 7 requires that “an engagement quality reviewer must have competence, 
          independence, integrity, and objectivity.”  See PCAOB AS 7.4. 
        
   33.    Per PCAOB AS 7, in an audit the engagement quality reviewer should review 
          engagement documentation, and specifically “should”: 
        
                                          *      *      * 
           
                 10(g).   Read other information in documents containing the financial 
                 statements to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
                 ("SEC") and evaluate whether the engagement team has taken 
                 appropriate action with respect to any material inconsistencies with the 
                 financial statements or material misstatements of fact of which the 
                 engagement quality reviewer is aware. 
           
          See PCAOB AS 7.10. 
        
   34.    To conduct the EQRs, Messineo relied upon Chadwick to provide him with audit 
          materials and documents.  But Chadwick did not provide him with the requisite 
          documentation for Messineo to conduct a proper EQR.   
           
   35.    For example, for at least five reviews, Chadwick failed to provide a complete draft 
          filing (Form 10-K, Form S-1, etc.) for Messineo’s review.  While Messineo may have 
          reviewed some form of the financial statements, Messineo did not read -- as required 

                                             9 
                                              
---------------------Page 10---------------------

          by PCAOB AS 7 -- the information in documents containing the financial statements 
          that were to be filed with the Commission prior to issuing his EQR.  Nor could he 
          evaluate whether Chadwick had taken appropriate action with respect to any material 
          inconsistencies with the financial statements or material misstatements of fact. 
       
   36.    Despite lacking sufficient documentation to conduct a proper EQR, Messineo 
          approved Chadwick’s issuance of the audit reports in violation of PCAOB auditing 
          standards.  See PCAOB AS 7.   
       
I.     AS CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER OF ISSUER A AND ISSUER B, MESSINEO 
      FALSELY CERTIFIED THEIR ANNUAL AND QUARTERLY REPORTS IN 
      2012 IN VIOLATION OF SECTION 13(a) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT AND 
      RULE 13a-14 THEREUNDER AND AIDED AND ABETTED AND CAUSED 
      ISSUER A AND ISSUER B TO VIOLATE SECTION 13(a) OF THE EXCHANGE 
      ACT AND RULES 13a-1 AND 13a-13 THEREUNDER. 
       
   37.    As Chief Financial Officer of Issuer A, Messineo provided certifications included 
          with Issuer A’s Forms 10-Qs for the quarters ending June 30, 2012 (filed August 14, 
          2012) and September 30, 2012 (filed November 14, 2012).   
           
   38.    As Chief Financial Officer of Issuer B, Messineo provided certifications included 
          with Issuer B’s Form 10-K for the annual period ending June 30, 2012 (filed October 
          15, 2012) and its amended Form 10-K filed October 22, 2012 covering the same 
          period.  
       
   39.    With respect to each report, Messineo certified that: 
       
               “Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue 
                 statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to 
                 make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which 
                 such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period 
                 covered by this report.” 
 
   40.    Messineo provided certifications for Issuer A and Issuer B pursuant to Rule 13a-14 
          under the Exchange Act.   
           
   41.    Rule 13a-14(a) under the Exchange Act requires the principal financial officer to 
          certify that, based on his knowledge, the Form 10-K or 10-Q submitted to the 
          Commission by the issuer “does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or 
          omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the 
          circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading….”  17 CFR 
          §240.13a-14(a).  
 

                                            10 
                                              
---------------------Page 11---------------------

42.    Messineo’s certifications were false because Messineo knew that Issuer A’s and 
       Issuer B’s auditor, DKM, was not independent as required by Section 13(a) of the 
       Exchange Act and Rule 10-01(d) of Regulation S-X.  See Exchange Act Section 13(a) 
       (requiring issuers to file annual reports certified by “independent public 
       accountants”); 17 CFR §210.10-01(d) (requiring that prior to filing, interim financial 
       statements included in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q “must be reviewed by an 
       independent public accountant using professional standards and procedures for 
       conducting such reviews….”).  An auditor’s lack of independence is a material fact.    
    
43.    DKM lacked independence because the engagement quality reviewer at DKM for the 
       Issuer A and Issuer B engagements -- Richard Confessore -- concurrently maintained 
       a prohibited business relationship with Messineo.  
    
44.    Rule 2-01(b) of Regulation S-X (Qualifications of Accountants) states that the 
       “Commission will not recognize an accountant as independent, with respect to an 
       audit client, if the accountant is not…capable of exercising objective and impartial 
       judgment on all issues encompassed within the accountant’s engagement.”  17 CFR 
       §210.2-01. 
    
45.    Rule 2-01(c) (3) states certain “business relationships” are inconsistent with 
       independence: 
    
              Business Relationships.  An accountant is not independent if, at any 
              point during the audit and professional engagement period, the 
              accounting firm or any covered person in the firm has any direct or 
              material indirect business relationship with an audit client, or with 
              persons associated with the audit client in a decision-making capacity, 
              such as an audit client’s officers, directors, or substantial stockholders. 
               
       17 CFR §210.2-01(c)(3) 
    
46.    Rule 2-01(f)(11) defines “covered person” to include partners, principals, 
       shareholders, and employees of an accounting firm on the “audit engagement team.”  
       17 CFR §210.2-01(f)(11).  The “audit engagement team” includes the “concurring or 
       reviewing partner.”  17 CFR §210.2-01(f)(7)(ii)(B).    
        
47.    PCAOB standards also require auditor independence.  PCAOB Rule 3520 (Auditor 
       Independence) requires that, “[a] registered public accounting firm and its associated 
       persons must be independent of the firm’s audit client throughout the audit and 
       professional engagement period.” 
    
48.    PCAOB AS 7 requires that “an engagement quality reviewer must have competence, 
       independence, integrity, and objectivity.”  See PCAOB AS 7.4. 
    

                                           11 
                                             
---------------------Page 12---------------------

   49.    In June 2012, Messineo hired Confessore to work for him at Messineo & Co.  
          Confessore worked at Messineo & Co. until mid-December 2012.  Thus, at the same 
          time Confessore conducted engagement quality reviews for DKM’s reviews of Issuer 
          A’s interim financial statements filed August 14, 2012 and November 14, 2012 and 
          for DKM’s audit of Issuer B’s annual financial statements filed October 15, 2012 and 
          amended October 22, 2012, Confessore worked under Messineo -- the Chief 
          Financial Officer of both Issuer A and Issuer B.  Confessore’s employment with 
          Messineo constitutes an improper business relationship and conflict of interest.     
        
   50.    As an auditor subject to independence rules, Messineo knew or should have known 
          that the audits and reviews being performed by DKM with Confessore as the 
          engagement quality reviewer violated the independence rules and relevant 
          professional standards. 
        
   51.    Despite Confessore’s and, therefore, DKM’s lack of independence, DKM issued an 
          audit report to Issuer B falsely stating that its audit was performed in accordance with 
          PCAOB standards.   
        
   52.    Despite knowing Confessore and DKM lacked independence, Messineo still certified 
          Issuer A’s quarterly reports and Issuer B’s annual report and amended annual report 
          in violation of Rule 13a-14. 
        
   53.    Messineo signed and approved for filing Issuer B’s annual report even though it 
          included DKM’s false audit report and had not been certified by an independent 
          public accountant.  He signed and approved for filing Issuer A’s quarterly reports 
          even though Issuer A’s interim financial statements had not previously been reviewed 
          by an independent public accountant  
        
   54.    Therefore, Messineo aided and abetted and caused Issuer A’s and Issuer B’s 
          violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 
          promulgated thereunder.   
        
J.     IN 2013, MESSINEO CAUSED DKM NOT TO BE INDPENDENT BY 
       POSSESSING A DIRECT FINANCIAL INTEREST IN DKM’S AUDIT CLIENTS 
       ISSUER A AND ISSUER B. 
        
   55.    Messineo resigned as Issuer B’s Chief Financial Officer effective October 30, 2012 
          and Issuer A’s Chief Financial Officer effective November 15, 2012.    
           
   56.    In mid-December 2012, Messineo joined DKM.  Messineo was a partner and one-
          third owner of DKM.   
        
   57.    Issuer A engaged DKM to perform audit services for the annual period ending 
          December 31, 2012 (Form 10-K filed April 15, 2013).  Issuer B engaged DKM to 

                                             12 
                                               
---------------------Page 13---------------------

           perform a review for the quarter ending December 31, 2012 (Form 10-Q filed 
           February 19, 2013).   
        
   58.    Charles Klein continued to be DKM’s lead partner for the Issuer A and Issuer B 
           engagements and Confessore continued as the engagement quality reviewer.  DKM 
           continued to lack independence from Issuer A and Issuer B because Messineo owned 
           stock in both companies during the audit and professional engagement periods. 
        
   59.    Rule 2-01(c)(1) (Financial Relationships) states that an accountant is not independent 
           if, at any point during the audit and professional engagement period, the accountant 
           has a “direct financial interest” in the accountant’s audit client, including when:  
        
              A.  The accounting firm [or] any covered person in the firm…has any 
                  direct investment in an audit client, such as stocks, bonds, notes, 
                  options, or other securities. 
 
                                        *      *       * 
              B.  Any partner, principal, shareholder, or professional employee of the 
                  accounting firm…has filed a Schedule 13D…with the Commission 
                  indicating beneficial ownership of more than five percent of an audit 
                  client’s securities. 
                   
           17 C.F.R. §210.2-01(c)(1)(i)(A)-(B) 
        
   60.    Rule 2-01(f)(11) defines “covered person” to include any “other partner, principal, or 
           shareholder from an ‘office’ of the accounting firm in which the lead audit 
           engagement partner primarily practices in connection with the audit.”  17 CFR 
           §210.2-01(f)(11).  “Office” means “a distinct sub-group within an accounting firm, 
           whether distinguished along geographic or practice lines.”  17 CFR §210.2-01(f)(15).    
            
   61.    During the professional engagement periods of DKM’s audit of Issuer A and interim 
           review of Issuer B from January through April 2013, Messineo -- a DKM partner 
           working in the same small office as Klein -- owned stock in DKM’s clients Issuer A 
           and Issuer B.  As of April 15, 2013, when Issuer A’s Form 10-K was filed, Messineo 
           owned approximately 6% of the outstanding stock of Issuer A.   
        
   62.    DKM was, therefore, not independent of its clients Issuer A and Issuer B with respect 
           to DKM’s audit and interim review of their public filings made in February 2013 and 
           April 2013, respectively, because Messineo possessed a direct financial interest (stock 
           ownership) in those companies during DKM’s professional engagement periods.  See 
           Regulation S-X Rule 2-01(c)(1).        
        

                                              13 
                                                 
---------------------Page 14---------------------

K.    IN 2013, MESSINEO CAUSED DKM NOT TO BE INDEPENDENT BECAUSE 
       HE WAS AN OFFICER OF DKM’S AUDIT CLIENTS ISSUER A AND ISSUER B 
       DURING THEIR RESPECTIVE AUDIT PERIODS. 
 
   63.    Rule 2-01(c)(2) (Employment Relationships) states that an accountant is not 
          independent if, at any point during the audit and professional engagement period, the 
          accountant has an “employment relationship” with an audit client, including when: 
           
              A former officer, director, or employee of an audit client becomes a 
              partner, principal, shareholder, or professional employee of the accounting 
              firm, unless the individual does not participate in, and is not in a position 
              to influence, the audit of the financial statements of the audit covering any 
              period during which he or she was employed by or associated with that 
              audit client. 
        
          17 CFR §210.2-01(c)(2)(iv) (Employment at Accounting Firm of Former Employee of 
          Audit Client).   
           
   64.    From at least January 2013 through April 2013, Messineo had space at DKM’s small 
          office in Clearwater, Florida along with Charles Klein and approximately 6-8 staff 
          personnel.  Messineo’s office was less than 10 feet away from the offices of those 
          providing audit services to Issuer A and Issuer B.   
           
   65.    From December 2012 through April 2013, Messineo had access to all of DKM’s audit 
          files, including those for the audit of Issuer A and the interim review of Issuer B.  
          Messineo supervised the audit staff at DKM, including the audit manager who 
          worked on the Issuer A audit, in some of DKM’s other engagements. 
        
   66.    During a significant portion of the professional engagement period for DKM’s audit 
          of Issuer A, Messineo possessed Issuer A’s books and records. 
        
   67.    DKM was, therefore, not independent of its clients Issuer A and Issuer B with respect 
          to DKM’s audit and interim review of their financial statements made in February 
          2013 and April 2013 because Messineo -- a partner and shareholder of DKM -- was 
          the CFO of Issuer A and Issuer B during the audit period and in a position to 
          influence DKM’s audit and interim reviews.  See Regulation S-X Rule 2-01(c)(2). 
 
L.     MESSINEO CAUSED DKM NOT TO BE INDEPENDENT BY EMPLOYING 
       ISSUER C’S FORMER CFO TO AUDIT ISSUER C FOR THE PERIOD HE WAS 
       CFO.  
 
   68.    Confessore was the CFO of Issuer C until April 12, 2011.  Following his resignation, 
          Confessore made himself available to Issuer C on a part-time basis to assist with 
          accounting matters.  On June 29, 2011, Issuer C filed a “Notification of Late Filing” 

                                            14 
                                               
---------------------Page 15---------------------

          for its Form 10-K.  The notification explained that Issuer C was unable to complete 
          its accounting at the subsidiary level.  Issuer C’s notification identified Confessore as 
          the person to contact in regard to the notification. 
           
   69.    In 2012, Issuer C engaged Messineo & Co. to perform audit services. Messineo 
          employed Confessore to participate in the year-end March 31, 2012 audit of Issuer C 
          even though Confessore had been CFO and worked for Issuer C during the audit 
          period.  As a result, Messineo & Co. was not independent of its client Issuer C.   
           
   70.    In June 2013, DKM issued an audit report for Issuer C’s financial statements for the 
          period from April 1, 2011 to March 31, 2012.  Prior to his departure from DKM in 
          April 2013, Messineo was the partner responsible for the engagement and allowed 
          Confessore to participate despite his prior employment with Issuer C.      
        
   71.    As a result of Messineo’s action, DKM was not independent of Issuer C with respect 
          to its public filings made in June 2013 because Confessore -- a partner of DKM -- 
          was the CFO of Issuer C during the audit period and participated in the audit.  See 
          Regulation S-X Rule 2-01(c)(2). 
        
M.    MESSINEO VIOLATED SECTIONS 13(d) AND 16(a) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT 
       AND RULES 13d-1, 13d-2, AND 16a-3 THEREUNDER WHEN HE FAILED TO 
       TIMELY FILE REQUIRED OWNERSHIP DISCLOSURES. 
        
   72.    Messineo failed to file required Commission ownership disclosures, including Forms 
          3, 4, and 5 and Schedule 13Ds, concerning stock ownership in Issuer A and Issuer B, 
          within the time period required. 
           
   73.    Section 13(d)  of the Exchange Act states:  
        
              (1)    Any person who, after acquiring directly or indirectly the 
                     beneficial ownership of any equity security of a class which is 
                     registered pursuant to section 12 of this title…, is directly or 
                     indirectly the beneficial owner of more than 5 per centum of such 
                     class shall, within ten days after such acquisition…file with the 
                     Commission, a statement containing such of the following 
                     information….” 
                      
              (2)    If any material change occurs in the facts set forth in the statement 
                     filed with the Commission, an amendment shall be filed with the 
                     Commission….” 
        
   74.    Rule 13d-1 (Filing of Schedule 13D and 13G) requires that a person satisfy his 
          obligations to file statements with the Commission under Section 13(d) by filing a 
          Schedule 13D or 13G. 

                                              15 
                                                
---------------------Page 16---------------------

            
   75.    Rule 13d-2 (Filing of Amendments to Schedules 13D or 13G) directs that: 
        
               (a)    If any material change occurs in the facts set forth in the Schedule 
                      13D… including, but not limited to, any material increase of 
                      decrease in the percentage of the class beneficially owned, the 
                      person or persons who were required to file the statement shall 
                      promptly file or cause to be filed with the Commission an 
                      amendment disclosing that change.   
                       
                                         *      *       * 
                       
                      [Any change] equal to one percent or more…shall be deemed 
                      “material” for purposes of this rule…. 
 
   76.    Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires that every officer, director, or beneficial 
           owner of more than 10% of stock file with the Commission statements disclosing 
           their holdings and transactions of any stock of the issuer. 
            
   77.    The statements shall be filed “within 10 days after he or she becomes such beneficial 
           owner, director, or officer….”  Statements shall also be filed for any change in such 
           ownership “before the end of the second business day following the day on which the 
           subject transaction has been executed….” 
        
   78.    Rule 16a-3 (Reporting Transactions and Holdings) states that: 
        
               (a)    Initial statements of beneficial ownership of equity securities 
                      required by Section 16(a) of the Act shall be filed on Form 3.  
                      Statements of changes in beneficial ownership required by that 
                      section shall be filed on Form 4.  Annual statements shall be filed 
                      on Form 5. 
                           
                                         *      *       * 
                           
               (f)(1)   A Form 5 shall be filed by every person who at any time during the 
                      issuer’s fiscal year was subject to section 1 of the Act…[and] shall 
                      be filed within 45 days after the issuer’s fiscal year end, and shall 
                      disclose the following holdings and transactions not reported 
                      previously on Forms 3, 4 or 5: 
                
                                     *      *       * 
                           
                      (iii)    all holdings and transactions that should have been reported 
                              during the most recent fiscal year, but were not… 

                                               16 
                                                  
---------------------Page 17---------------------

 
        
   79.    A Form 4 must be filed to report new acquisitions, and must be “filed before the end 
           of the second business day following the day on which the subject transaction had 
           been executed.  See Rule 16a-3(g)(1).  
            
   80.    In January 2010, Messineo first acquired shares in Issuer A.  The following month, 
           February 2010, he became Issuer A’s CFO.  Within 10 days of becoming CFO, 
           Messineo was obligated to file a Form 3 disclosing his ownership of Issuer A stock.  
           See Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act; see also Rule 16a-3.  Messineo failed to do 
           so.  Instead, Messineo filed an erroneous Form 3 over three years late in 2013, after 
           he had resigned as CFO.  
        
   81.    Messineo acquired 2,000,000 and 70,000,000 shares of Issuer A stock on December 
           28, 2010 and December 28, 2011, respectively.  Messineo failed to file Form 4s after 
           acquiring the stock or Form 5s for either FY 2010 or 2011 listing all holdings and 
           transactions that should have been reported previously on Forms 3 and 4.  See Section 
           16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 16a-3 thereunder.    
        
   82.    By March 2011, Messineo owned 12% of Issuer A’s outstanding stock, and by March 
           2012 Messineo’s ownership share surpassed 30%.  Yet, Messineo never filed a 
           Schedule 13D with the Commission or any subsequent amendment disclosing his 
           greater than 5% beneficial ownership.  See Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and 
           Rules 13d-1 and 13d-2 thereunder.     
        
   83.    Messineo became CFO of Issuer B in September 2010 and resigned as Issuer B’s 
           CFO effective October 30, 2012.  Messineo acquired Issuer B stock on November 11, 
           2010.  Messineo has never filed a Form 3, Form 4, or Form 5 with the Commission in 
           connection with his ownership of Issuer B stock in violation of the securities laws.  
           See Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 16a-3 thereunder.

           Messineo committed intentional and knowing conduct that resulted in violations of 
           applicable professional standards and committed repeated instances of highly

           Act and Rule 13a-1 and thereunder.  
        
   89.    As a result of the conduct described above, in his capacity as CFO Messineo willfully 
           aided and abetted and caused Issuer A’s violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange 
           Act and Rule 13a-13 thereunder.   
        
   90.    As a result of the conduct described above, Messineo willfully violated Sections 
           13(d) and 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13d-1, 13d-2, and 16a-3 thereunder.
