                                              I.  
 
       The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the 
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against 
Salvatore Censoprano (“Respondent” or “Censoprano”) pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(i) of the 
Commission’s Rules of Practice.1 
                                  
                                                
                                             II.  
 
       In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the 

                                                 
1
 Rule 102(e)(3)(i) provides, in relevant part, that: 
 
       The Commission, with due regard to the public interest and without preliminary hearing, 
may, by order, . . . suspend from appearing or practicing before it any . . . accountant . . . who has 
been by name . . . permanently enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction, by reason of his 
or her misconduct in an action brought by the Commission, from violating or aiding and abetting 
the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or of the rules and regulations 
thereunder.

purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings  
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these 
proceedings, and the findings contained in Section III.3,  below, which are admitted, Respondent 
consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Rule 102(e) 
of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions 
(“Order”), as set forth below.   
 
                                              III.  
 
       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that:  
        
       1.     Censoprano, age 49, is and has been a certified public accountant licensed to practice 
in the State of California.  He served as Chief Financial Officer  of M&A West, Inc. during 1999 and 
2000. 
        
       2.     M&A West, Inc. (“M&A West”) was, at all relevant times, a Colorado corporation 
with its principal place of business in San Bruno, California.  M&A West was engaged in the 
business of developing start-up internet-related businesses.  M&A West issued common stock that  
was registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of  
1934 (“Exchange Act”) and quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. 
 
       3.     On September 6, 2001, the Commission filed a complaint against Censoprano and 
others, captioned SEC v. M&A West, et al., Civil Action No. C-01-3376 VRW (Northern District  
of California).  On October 28, 2005, the court entered an order permanently enjoining 
Censoprano, by consent, from future violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange  
Act, and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting future 
violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 
13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder.  Censoprano was also ordered to pay a $250,000 civil 
money penalty and was prohibited from acting as an officer or director of an issuer that has 
securities registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. 
 
       4.     The Commission’s complaint alleged, among other things, that Censoprano 
 participated with other persons associated with M&A West in a fraudulent scheme which 
 resulted in M&A West filing materially false and misleading financial statements in the 
 company’s annual reports on Form 10-KSB for the fiscal years ended May 31, 1999 and May 
 31, 2000, and in the company’s quarterly reports  on Form 10-QSB for the quarters ended August 
 31, 1999 and November 30, 1999, and a materially false and misleading Form 8-K/A dated 
 August 18, 1999.  The complaint alleged that  Censoprano participated in several instances 
 involving the preparation of documents and accounting entries that were used to improperly 
 account for cash received by M&A West and to materially increase M&A West’s annual and 
 quarterly revenue and net income, and which represented a departure from generally accepted 
 accounting principles (“GAAP”).  Among other things, Censoprano is alleged to have 
 participated in the creation of agreements that did not exist, and in improperly accounting for  
 securities held by M&A West.  In addition, the complaint alleged that Censoprano provided 

                                               2

 misleading information, and failed to disclose information, to M&A West’s independent auditors 
 about certain of the Company’s fraudulent practices. 
 
                                                                IV. 
                                                                   
          In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
impose the sanction agreed to in Respondent Censoprano’s Offer. 
 
          Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that:  
 
          A.        Censoprano is suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission as 
an accountant. 
 
 
 By the Commission.

       Secretary                                                                     

                                                                  3
