jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these proceedings and to the entry of this Order 
Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934, Making Findings and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order and Order of Suspension 
Pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice (“Order”), as set forth below. 
  
                                               III.  
 
       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds  2
                                                                                  that: 
 
       1.      This matter concerns insider trading by Ng, who in late 2007 and 2008 disclosed 
material nonpublic information that he obtained in the course of his employment at Marvell 
Technology Group, Ltd. (“Marvell”) to Winifred Jiau (“Jiau”) and Son Ngoc Nguyen (“Nguyen”).   
Jiau and Nguyen, in turn, traded Marvell securities based on the material nonpublic information. 
 
       2.       By virtue of his conduct, Ng violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 
10b-5 thereunder. 
 
       3. Stanley Ng      , age 43 and a resident of Cupertino, California is a Certified Public 
Accountant (“CPA”) licensed in California (although his license is currently inactive).  From 2002 
through 2011, Ng worked in the finance department of Marvell, serving as the company’s “SEC 
Reporting Manager” from 2002 until September 2010.  Ng has already pleaded guilty to one count 
of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud before the United States District Court for 
the Southern District of New York in U.S. v. Ng , S4 11-cr-161 (JSR), and has been sentenced to 
two years of probation, ordered to forfeit $6,464 (based on the illegal trading profits of his direct 
tippees) and fined $2,000. 
 
       4. Jiau     , age 44, is currently incarcerated in a federal correctional facility in California 
after being convicted in June 2011 of securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud 
and wire fraud, and sentenced to a 48-month term of imprisonment by the United States District 
Court for the Southern District of New York in U.S. v. Jiau, 11-cr-161 (JSR).  Jiau is also the 
subject of a permanent antifraud injunction, which was entered against her by the United States  
District Court for the Southern District of New York in SEC v. Longoria, et al., 11-cv-753 (JSR).  
        
       5. Nguyen       , age 39, is a resident of San Jose, California.  Nguyen pleaded guilty to one 
count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud before the United States District 
Court for the Southern District of New York in U.S. v. Nguyen, S3 11-cr-161 (JSR), and was 
sentenced to one year of probation and ordered to forfeit $6,464 in illegal trading profits. 
 
       6. Marvell       is a Bermuda corporation headquartered in Santa Clara, California.  
Marvell is a global provider of semiconductors and microprocessor integrated circuits.  
Marvell’s securities are registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the 
Exchange Act and its stock trades on the NASDAQ under the symbol “MRVL.”  
                                                 
2 
  The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent’s Offer of Settlement and are not binding on any other   
person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

       7.     In late 2007 and 2008, Ng, Jiau and Nguyen participated in a scheme to exchange 
material nonpublic information for the purpose of executing securities trades while in possession of  
material nonpublic information.  Ng agreed to provide Jiau with material, nonpublic information 
regarding the financial performance of his employer, Marvell.  In exchange, Jiau and Nguyen 
agreed to provide Ng with stock tips. 
 
       8.     On May 17 and May 27, 2008, Ng spoke to Jiau by telephone and provided her 
with inside information regarding Marvell’s performance for its first fiscal quarter, which had 
ended on May 3, 2008 and for which Marvell would publicly announce results on May 29, 2008.  
Specifically, Ng informed Jiau that Marvell would announce quarterly revenues of $804 million, a 
gross profit margin of 51.6%, and earnings per share would be $0.11.  These results were  
significantly better than market analysts’ expectations at the time. 
 
       9.     On May 29, 2008, prior to Marvell’s announcement of its quarterly results, Jiau 
purchased 875 shares of Marvell stock while in possession of material nonpublic information that 
she had received from Ng.   
 
       10.    That same day Ng also had a telephone conversation with Nguyen during which Ng 
provided Nguyen with material nonpublic information regarding Marvell’s quarterly earnings. 
 
       11.    Later that day (and before Marvell announced its quarterly results), Nguyen  
purchased 1,000 shares of Marvell stock while in possession of material nonpublic information that 
he had received from Ng.  
 
       12.    After market-close on May 29, 2008, Marvell released its quarterly results for the 
first quarter of 2008, including revenues of $804 million, a gross profit margin of 52% and 
earnings per share of $0.11, almost exactly as Ng had stated.  These results, which were  
significantly better than market analysts expected, caused the stock price to increase 23% (from 
$14.08 per share at market-close on May 29 to $17.36 per share at market-close on May 30). 
 
       13.    The increase in Marvell’s stock price resulted in combined profits of $6,464 for  
Jiau and Nguyen. (Ng did not share in the insider trading profits of Jiau or Nguyen.)  
 
       14.    By providing the information regarding Marvell’s quarterly earnings to Jiau and 
Nguyen, Ng violated the duty he owed to Marvell to keep all material nonpublic information 
concerning the company confidential, as well as a specific company policy which prohibits the 
tipping of material nonpublic information to persons outside Marvell. 
  
       15.    As a result of the conduct described above, Ng violated Section 10(b) of the  
Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, which prohibit fraudulent conduct in connection with 
the purchase or sale of securities.

                                              IV. 
 
       In view of the foregoing, the Commission finds that Ng has been convicted of a felony 
within the meaning of Rule 102(e)(2) and deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions agreed to 
in Ng’s Offer. 
        
       Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that:  
 
       A.     Pursuant to Section 21C  of the Exchange Act, Ng shall cease and desist from 
committing or causing any violations and any future violations of  Section 10(b) of the Exchange 
Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. 
        
       B.     Ng is forthwith suspended from appearing or prac ticing before  the Commission 
pursuant to Rule 102(e)(2) of the  Commission’s Rules of Practice. 
        
       C.     Pursuant to Section 21C(f) of the Exchange Act Ng, is barred from acting as an 
officer or director of any issuer that has a class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the 
Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78l] or  that is required to file reports pursuant to Section 15(d) of the  
Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78o(d)]. 
        
       D.     Ng shall, within 180 days of the entry of this Order, pay disgorgement of $6,464 
and prejudgment interest of $984.23, for a total of $7,448.23, to the Securities and Exchange 
Commission to be remitted to the United States Treasury.  Ng’s obligations to pay disgorgement in 
the amount of $6,464 and pre-judgment interest in the amount of $984.23 will be credited dollar 
for dollar by the amount of the forfeiture order of $6,464 entered against Ng in criminal case 
number 11-CR-0161 (JSR) in the United States District Court of the Southern District of New 
York.  Thus, within 180 days of  the entry of this Order, Ng shall pay $984.23 to the Securities and 
Exchange Commission to be remitted to the United States Treasury.  If timely payment is not 
made, additional interest shall accrue pursuant to SEC Rule of Practice 600.  Payment shall be: (A) 
made by wire transfer, United States postal money order, certified check, bank cashier’s check, 
bank money order, or by credit or debit card via Pay.gov through the SEC website at

Commission; (C) hand-delivered or mailed to Enterprise Services Center, Accounts Receivable

New York Regional Office, 3 World Financial Center, Suite 400, New York, New York 10281. 
        
       E.     Ng shall, within 180 days of the entry of this Order, pay a civil money penalty in 
the amount of $6,464 to the Securities and Exchange Commission to be remitted to the United 
States Treasury.  If timely payment is not made, additional interest shall accrue pursuant to 31 
U.S.C. 3717.  Such paym ent shall be: (A) made by wire transfer, United States postal money order,
