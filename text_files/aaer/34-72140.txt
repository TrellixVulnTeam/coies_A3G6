       These administrative proceedings, instituted pursuant to Rule of Practice 102(e)(1)(iii), 
center on respondents' alleged willful refusal to provide the Commission with audit work papers 
in violation of their obligations under Section 106 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as amended by 
Section 929J of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank 
     1
Act).    Four of the five respondents, Ernst & Young Hua Ming LLP (E&      Y), KPMG Huazhen 
(Special General Partnership) (KPMG), Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Certified Public Accountants 
Ltd. (DTTC), and PricewaterhouseCoopers Zhong Tian CPAs Limited (PwC)            , have   petitioned 
                                                                                 2
for  review of the initial decision issued by the law judge on January 22, 2014.    T he Division of 
Enforcement   (Division) has filed a petition for review as to the scope of the remedies imposed by 
the initial decision.   In addition, the same four respondents also  filed  a  motion for leave to 
adduce additional evidenc  e .   The Division opposes this  motion   and, in the alternative, seeks 
leave to adduce its own   additional evidence.  We  have determined to grant the motions to adduce 
additional evidence and  the petitions for review.

                                              BACKGROUND 

        A.       The orders instituting proceedings                                                     

        We issued the orders instituting proceedings in May 2012 and December 2012 and 
                                   3
consolidated them for hearing.         The OIPs   allege  d  that each respondent is  a  foreign public 

accounting   firm  located in China    and, within China,    supervised and regul    ated by  , inter alia, the 

China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC).  Respondents performed audit work for ten 

clients—DTTC Client A and Clients A through I—based in China.  The Division had or has 

ongoing fraud investigations concerning those clients, each of which is a U.S. issuer whose 

securities were registered with the Commission.  

        According to the OIPs, at various times between March 2011 and April 2012, the 

Division served requests for audit work papers pertaining to those clients on respondents through 

respondents' designated U.S. agents.  These requests were made pursuant to Section 106(b) of 

the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which provides that a foreign accounting firm that, among other things, 

"issues an audit report, performs audit work, or conducts interim reviews" is required to "produce 

the audit work papers . . . and all other documents of the firm related to any such audit work or 
                                                                                      4
interim review to the Commission . . . , upon request of the Commission."                 The OIPs allege  d  

that  each resp ondent, after receiving the Commission's requests,         informed the    s taff that it would 

not produce the documents       on the ground that    it interpreted Chinese law as preventing       firms 

from giving audit work papers directly to U.S. regulators.           As of the issuance o   f the OIPs, the 

Commission did not have possession of          any of   the  requested work papers.       

        The OIPs allege    d  that  respondents  violated  Section 106   (e), which p  rovides that   a " willful 

refusal  " of an accounting firm   to  " comply  , in whole or in part,  with any   request by the 
                                                                                     5
Commission     . . .  shall be deemed a violation  " of the  Sarbanes  -Oxley Act    .    The Division  sought 

to impose remedies     under   Rule of Practice 102   , which   provides that the "Commission may 

censure a person or deny, temporarily or permanently, the p           rivilege of appearing or practicing 

before it . . . to any person who is found by the Commission" to have "willfully violated . . . any 
                                               6
provision of the Federal securities laws."

         B.        The law judge's initial decision 

         Before the law judge, respondents argued that they did not "willfully refuse" to comply 

with the Commission's requests and that they acted in good faith.  They claimed that they were 

willing to produce the requested work papers, but that Chinese law prevented them from doing 

so directly.  They argued that they had offered to provide the CSRC with the documents and 

believed that the Commission would be able to obtain them after discussions with the CSRC.  

After hearing testimony, the law judge issued an initial decision finding that respondents had 

willfully violated Section 106 and imposing remedies pursuant to Rule 102(e). 

         In large part, the law judge credited respondents' assertion that their refusal to produce 
                                                                                                                7
the work papers was "driven by their concerns over potentially draconian Chinese law."                              But he 

concluded that, as a matter of law, the motive for respondents' refusal was immaterial to whether 

they had "willfully refused" to comply with the Commis                 sion's requests within the meaning of 
                   8
Section 106(e).        According to the     initial decision   , "' willful refusal to comply     ' means   'choosing 
                                                                                                                9
not to act after receiving notice that action was requested,             ' without regard to good faith.       "   

         Next, t  he  initial decisio  n  rejected respondents' reliance on         Section 106(f), which       provides 

that  " the staff of the Commission        . . .  may allow a foreign public accounting firm            . . .  to meet 

production obligations       . . .  through alternate means, such as through foreign             counterparts o    f the 
                  10
Commission."           Respondents argued that the Commission had tried to obtain the work papers 

for certain clients through the CSRC, and therefore could not sanction them for refusing to 

directly produce the work papers.           The law judge disagreed.  He conc           luded that    Section 106 

authorized the Commission to pursue "            multiple possible avenues for obtaining documents                " and 
                                                                                                      11
that "[n] othing compels the Commission to use one avenue rather than another                       ."   

         Turning to the issue of remedies, the initial decision             denied, for a period of six months, 

the privilege of practicing or appearing before the Commission to                   the four appealing 

respondents; it    also  censure   d  respondent Dahua      .   The law judge determined, among other things, 

that remedial measures        were warranted on       the ground     that "  future violations [were] virtually 

certain because Respondents consider themselves unable to produce audit work papers directly to 
                                                                                        12
the Commission even under any future Sarbanes                -Oxley 106 request."          

         Finally, the law judge denied respondent            s' post -hearing   motion to supplement the record 

with   exhibits  showing    , in respondents' view, that       the Commission can        feasibly   obtain   work

papers through the CSRC.  According to respondents, several sets of work papers have already 

been turned over to the Commission and substantial progress has been made with respect to the 

remainder.  The law judge stated that the evidence, which respondents sought to add after the 
                                                                13
close of the record, was "potentially exculpatory."                  But he found that    there was "no good cause 

to reopen the record" because the          " probative value    "  of the evidence    was "unclear" and       because 

he could not "   evaluate the relevance and weight of such evidence without hearing from live 
              14
witnesses   ."     He  believed that the    " better app  roach  "  was  for  respondents "    to petition the 
                                                                                                15
Commission to adduce additional evidence               "  when the matter was appealed.            

                                                    DISCUSSION 

         We have determined to grant respondents' motion for leave to adduce additional 

evidence, the Division's cross-motion in the alternative for leave to adduce other additional 

evidence, and the petitions for review. 

         A.        The motion and cross-motion for leave to adduce additional evidence 

         Respondents seek leave to adduce the exhibits that the law judge declined to admit, as 

well as several other documents reflecting subsequent production activity through the CSRC 
                                                 16
("Respondents' Additional Evidence").                 They   argue that   the evidence     proves   that their 

production obligations       as to many of the requested work papers              have   already   " been sati sfied 

under Section 106(f)."  They also argue that            it demonstrates      that the "CSRC is an alternative          

means of production," which both vindicates respondents' good faith and makes                         the Section 106 

requests unenforceable.        R espondents     further   contend that    thei r a dditional   e vidence "undermines 

the sanction proposed by the Initial Decision"             by showing that the Commission will be able to 

obtain work papers       through the CSRC        in the future.    

         The Division      opposes respondents' motion on the ground that               Respondents'      Addi  tional 

Evidence is not, in the Division's view, material.             According to the Division,         that evidence 

merely   "support[s] legal theories that the Initial Decision and other [law judge] rulings properly 

rejected."  It  argues   that  the evidence     has  "no bearing"     on  whether    respondents     violated Section 

106(e)   or the   remedial   measures to be imposed under Rule 102               because the "Initial Decision 

rejected all of respondents' legal arguments that could conceivably make                     [Respondents'] 

Additional Evidence relevant."  Finally, and in the alternative, the Division                   cross  -moves for

leave to adduce its own evidence (the "Division's Additional Evidence") that provides context as 
                                                                                                      17
to the extent, completeness, and timeliness of the productions through the CSRC.                         

         We  have determined to        grant   respondents'    motion   and the Division's cross      -motion  .   Rule 

of Practice 452    permits    a  party to submit additional evidence "at any time prior to issuance of a 

decision by the Commission" as long as the party can "               show with particularity      "  (1)  that such 

additional evidence is material       "  and  (2)  " that there were reasonable grounds for failure to adduce 
                                 18
such evidence previously."            Each of these elements is satisfied here.         

         We  find  that  the materiality element of Rule 452 is satisfied            at this juncture of the 

proceeding   s .   We  appreciate   that t  he parties fundamentally disagree         as the correct construction of 

Section 106 and as to the inferences that should be drawn from the proffered evidenc                       e.   At 

bottom,   the Division    's opposition is premised on the        immateriality     of the   e vidence  in light of  the 

Division  's own reading of Section 106.  In other words, the Division argues that the evidence 

could not possibly make a difference under its theory of the case, which prevailed before the law 

judge.  We are unwilling to deny respondents' motion on this basis, as doing so would be 
                                                                     19
tantamount to summarily affirming the initial decision.                   Instead, we   will  defer   assessment of 

the  probative value that shoul      d ultimately be afforded       the additional evidence       until   we have 

received the benefit of full briefing and argument,            revi ewed the record in its entirety,       and 
                                                          20
resolved   the merits of    the  petitions for review.         Like any other ruling on admissibility, our 
                                                                                                          21
ruling in this regard is    by nature    subject to revision until issuance of a final decision.                

         It is undisputed    that  Rule 452's timeliness      element is    satisfied , and we so find.      The 

developments      relating to prod   uctions   through    the CSRC     did not take place until after the close of

         The Division's     Additional     Evidence consists of      proposed     Exhibits 359 through 375.         

Respondents do not oppose the cross           -motion to adduce the       Division's Additional Evidence.

         17 C.F.R. §     201 .452.

         Cf. Rule 411(e)(2), 17 C.F.R. § 201.411(e)(2) ("The Commission may grant summary 

affirmance if it finds that no issue raised in the initial decision warrants consideration by the 

Commission of further oral or written argument."). 

20
         Put another way, we will take into consideration              the  additional   evidence, but    we do not     in 

so doing   comm  it ourselves to giving it       any  particular  —or, indeed, any—weight in exculpation or 

mitigation.  See generally Morris v. Sec'y, Dep't of Corr., 677 F.3d 1117, 1131 (11th Cir. 2012);

the hearing and the evidence, which reflects those developments, was unavailable earlier.                              W e 

find  that  there are  "reasonable grounds for failure to adduce" the              evidence earlier.      

         For the above reasons, we have determined that the requirements of Rule                        452 are 

satisfied as to   Respondents'      Additional Evidence and the Division's Additional Evidence.  

Accordingly, it is     ORDERED         that  respondents'    motion to adduce additional evidence             and  the 

Division's cross    -motion    to adduce additional evidence          are GRANTED.          Respondents'      Additional 

Evidence and the Division's Additional             Evidence     are hereby received into the record.          

          B.       The petitions for review 

         We turn next to the parties' petitions for review.  Upon due consideration, and pursuant to 
                                                                                                                          23
Rule of Practice 411, the petitions for review of the law judge's initial decision are GRANTED.                               

Pursuant to Rule of Practice 411(d), the Commission                 also  will determine what sanctions, if any, 
                                     24
are appropriate     in this matter.
