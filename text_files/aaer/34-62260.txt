Respondent. 
 
  
                                          I. 
 
              The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) deems it appropriate that cease-
and-desist proceedings be, and he reby are, instituted pursuant to  Section 21C of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) against Harry O. Nicodemus IV, CPA (Nicodemus or 
Respondent).    
 
                                          II. 
 
              In anticipation of the institution of these  proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the Offer) whic h the Commission has determined  to accept.  Solely for the 
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings 
herein, except as to the Commissions jurisd  iction over him and the subject matter of these 
proceedings, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Cease-
and-Desist Proceedings, Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making 
Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order (Order), as set forth below.

                                               III. 
 
              On the basis of this Order and Respondents Offer, the Commission finds1
                                                                                  that: 

                                        RESPONDENT 

       1.      Nicodemus resides in Katy, Texas and was the chief financial officer of Equus 
Total Return, Inc. (Equus), a business development company (BDC), from November 2003 to 
November 2006.  He is a CPA licensed in Texas.     

                                OTHER RELEVANT ENTITY 

       2.      Equus, a Delaware corporation based in Houston, Texas, became a BDC on 
September 6, 1991.  Equus trades as a closed-end fund on the New York Stock Exchange, under 
the symbol EQS.  Its securities are registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act.   
 
                                             FACTS 
        
       3.           On June 30, 2005, Equuss shareholders approved a new fund adviser and a new 
fund administrator.  Equuss board ratified the shareholder vote at a meeting later that day. 
        
       4.           On August 9, 2005, Equuss board agreed to pay the new fund administrator a one-
time supplemental fee of $535,000 to reimburse extraordinary costs that were incurred by [the 
fund administrator] above what had been anticipated with respect to the change in administrators.   
        
       5.           Nicodemus thereafter prepared (or assigned someone to prepare) a spreadsheet 
outlining the components of the supplemental fee: $400,000 for a consulting agreement with an 
Equus officer (Fund officer); $60,000 for the Fund officers retention bonus; and $75,000 of 
retention bonuses for other personnel.  The spreadsheet was prepared in connection with finalizing 
Equuss second quarter 2005 Form 10-Q.       
        
       6.           Equus filed its second quarter 2005 Form 10-Q on August 15, 2005.  Nicodemus 
certified this filing, which disclosed that the Fund had reimbursed the new administrator $535,000 
for unexpected costs and expenses associated with the change in administrators.  The Form 10-Q, 
however, failed to disclose that the true purpose of the special administrative fee was to 
compensate the Fund officer.   
        
       7.           On March 31, 2006, Equus filed its 2005 Form 10-K, which Nicodemus certified.  
This filing also disclosed that the special administrative fee was associated with the change in 
administrators, but failed to disclose that the true purpose of the special administrative fee was to 
compensate the Fund officer.   

       8.           On April 24, 2006, Equus filed its annual proxy statement providing information 
about officer and director compensation in 2005.  The proxy statement represented that the Fund

       The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent's Offer of Settlement and are not binding on any 
other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

officer received compensation of $136,620 in 2005, consisting of realized earnings from the 
companys acquisition of his 198,000 stock options.  This figure was materially understated 
because the Fund officer in fact received more than $430,000 from the transaction.             
          
                                                VIOLATIONS 
                                                          
              9.           As a result of conduct described above, Nicodemus violated Rule 13a-14 under the 
Exchange Act.  In addition, Nicodemus caused Equuss violations              of Section 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) 
and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1, 13a-13 and 12b-20 thereunder. 
   
                                                       IV. 
                                                          
         In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in Respondent Nicodemuss Offer.  Accordingly, pursuant to Section 21C of the 
Exchange Act, it is hereby ORDERED that: 
         
        Respondent cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future 
violations of Exchange Act Rule 13a-14 and from causing any violations and any future violations 
of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 13a-1, 13a-13 and 
12b-20 thereunder.   
                   
        By the Commission.
