1934 and Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing

                                             III. 

       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds3
                                                                               that: 

A.     RESPONDENT 

       Norman Stumacher, CPA, 81, of Bellmore, New York, is a certified public accountant 
licensed in the state of New York since 1960 and doing business as a sole proprietorship.  
Stumacher audited MediaREADY, Inc.’s (“MediaREADY”) financial statements for the 
company’s 2003 fiscal year ended December 31, 2003.  MediaREADY dismissed Stumacher as its 
independent auditor on February 22, 2005. 

B.     FACTS 

       1.     MediaREADY (known as Video Without Boundaries, Inc. during the relevant time 
period) is a Florida corporation with its headquarters in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.  MediaREADY’s 
common stock is registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act 
and is listed on the Pink Sheets under the symbol MRED.  For its fiscal year ended December 31, 
2003, MediaREADY reported revenues of $191,000 and total assets of $875,000. 

       2.     MediaREADY has at all relevant times been an issuer as defined by the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Act”). 

       3.     Stumacher audited MediaREADY’s 2003 financial statements included in 
MediaREADY’s annual report for fiscal year 2003 on Form 10-KSB, filed with the Commission 
on April 14, 2004. As part of that audit, Stumacher prepared and issued an audit report dated April 
12, 2004 (the “MediaREADY audit report”), which the company included in its 2003 Form 10-
KSB.  MediaREADY paid Stumacher $25,000 for the audit work. 

3 
       The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent’s Offer of Settlement and are not binding on any 
other person or entity in this or any other proceeding. 

                                              2

---------------------Page 3---------------------

        4.      At the time Stumacher prepared and issued the MediaREADY audit report, he was 
not registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the “Board”), as required by 
Section 102(a) of the Act. 

        5.      By order dated April 26, 2005, the Board disapproved an application for 
registration submitted by Stumacher based in part on Stumacher’s violation of Section 102(a) of 
the Act in issuing the MediaREADY audit report.     4
                                                       The order effectively prevented Stumacher 
from becoming registered with the Board until after February 15, 2006, approximately one year 
from the date the Board issued a notice of hearing on Stumacher’s application.     5
                                                                                     Stumacher has 
only worked as an accountant through his sole proprietorship and has not otherwise been 
associated with a public accounting firm registered with the Board. 

C.      VIOLATIONS 

        1.      Section 102(a) of the Act provides that “it shall be unlawful for any person that is 
not a registered public accounting firm to prepare or issue, or to participate in the preparation or 
issuance of, any audit report with respect to any issuer.” 6 

        2.      The provisions of Section 102(a) of the Act became effective on October 22, 2003.       7 

        3.      Based on the conduct described above, Respondent willfully      8
                                                                                  violated Section 
102(a) of the Act. 

D. FINDI       NGS 

        Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that Stumacher willfully violated Section 
102(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 

4 
        PCAOB Release No. 2005-008 (Apr. 26, 2005).  The order also found that Stumacher’s issuance of the 
MediaREADY audit report violated Board Rule 2100, which implemented Section 102(a) of the Act.  Id. 
5 
        The order states that with respect to any new registration application Stumacher submits after February 15, 
2006, the Board will not issue a notice of hearing to determine whether to approve or disapprove such application 
based solely on the violations subject to the Board’s order.  Id. 
6 
        A violation of the Act or any rule that the Board issues under the Act is treated for all purposes in the same 
manner as a violation of the Exchange Act, including with respect to penalties.  Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 15 
U.S.C.A. § 7202(b)(1) (West 2002). 
7 
        Section 102(a) became effective “[b]eginning 180 days after the date of the determination of the 
Commission under Section 101(d)” of the Act that the Board was prepared to undertake its statutory responsibilities.  
The Commission made the required determination on April 25, 2003.  See Order Regarding Section 101(d) of the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Securities Act Release No. 8223, Exchange Act Release No. 47746, 2003 WL 
1956164  (Apr. 25, 2003). 
8 
        “Willfully” as used in this Order means intentionally committing the act that constitutes the violation. 
There is no requirement that the actor also be aware that he is violating a rule or statute.  See Wonsover v. SEC, 205 
F.3d 408, 414 (D.C. Cir. 2000); Tager v. SEC, 344 F.2d 5, 8 (2d Cir. 1965).

E.     UNDERTAKING 

       Respondent has undertaken not to request, demand, or accept, directly or indirectly, any

MediaREADY audit report.  In determining whether to accept the Offer, the Commission has

                                             IV.

       C.     Stumacher may practice before the Commission as an independent accountant

the Board in accordance with the Act, and such registration continues to be effective; and 

              2.     He has submitted to the Commission staff (attention: Office of the Chief 
Accountant) the Board’s letter notifying the public accounting firm with which he is associated that 
its registration application has been approved. 

       D.     IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent shall, within 10 days of the entry of 
this Order, pay disgorgement of $25,000 and prejudgment interest of $1,865.60 to the United
