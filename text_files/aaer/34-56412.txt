A.     RESPONDENT 

       Harvey S. Weingard, CPA, 73, of Boynton Beach, Florida, is a certified public accountant 
licensed in the state of Florida since 2002 and doing business as a sole proprietorship.  Weingard 
audited The Furia Organization, Inc.’s (“Furia”) financial statements for the company’s 2003 and 
2004 fiscal years ended June 30, 2003, and June 30, 2004, respectively. 

B.     FACTS 

       1.     Furia is a Delaware corporation with its headquarters in Rockwall, Texas.  For its 
fiscal years ended June 30, 2003, and June 30, 2004, Furia had no revenues and no assets.   

       2.     Furia has at all relevant times been an issuer as defined by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
of 2002 (the “Act”). 

       3.     Weingard audited Furia’s 2003 financial statements included in Furia’s annual 
report for fiscal year 2003 on Form 10-KSB, filed with the Commission on July 6, 2004.  As part 
of that audit, Weingard prepared and issued an audit report dated June 30, 2004, which the 
company included in its 2003 Form 10-KSB.  Furia paid Weingard $3,000 for the audit work. 

       4.     Weingard also audited Furia’s 2004 financial statements included in Furia’s annual 
report for fiscal year 2004 on Form 10-KSB, filed with the Commission on October 21, 2004.  As 
part of that audit, Weingard prepared and issued an audit report dated October 13, 2004 (together 
with the June 30, 2004 audit report, the “Furia audit reports”), which the company included in its 

3 
       The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent’s Offer of Settlement and are not binding on any 
other person or entity in this or any other proceeding. 

                                                2

2004 Form 10-KSB.  Furia paid Weingard $5,000 for the audit work.         4 

        5.      At the time Weingard prepared and issued the Furia audit reports, he was not 
registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the “Board”), as required by 
Section 102(a) of the Act. 

        6.      By order dated April 18, 2005, the Board disapproved an application for 
registration submitted by Weingard based in part on Weingard’s violation of Section 102(a) of 
the Act in issuing the Furia audit reports. 5
                                               The order effectively prevented Weingard from 
becoming registered with the Board until after February 15, 2006, approximately one year from 
the date the Board issued a notice of hearing on Weingard’s application.       6
                                                                                  Weingard has only 
worked as an accountant through his sole proprietorship and has not otherwise been associated 
with a public accounting firm registered with the Board. 

C.      VIOLATIONS 

        1.      Section 102(a) of the Act provides that “it shall be unlawful for any person that is 
not a registered public accounting firm to prepare or issue, or to participate in the preparation or 
issuance of, any audit report with respect to any issuer.”  7 

        2.      The provisions of Section 102(a) of the Act became effective on October 22, 2003.        8 

        3.      Based on the conduct described above, Respondent willfully       9
                                                                                   violated Section 
102(a) of the Act. 

4 
        During the course of the Commission’s investigation, Weingard voluntarily reimbursed Furia the $8,000 in 
audit fees through a combination of repayment and the provision of non-audit services to Furia.  In view of 
Weingard’s reimbursement, the Commission is not ordering disgorgement in this matter. 
5 
        PCAOB Release No. 2005-004 (Apr. 18, 2005).  The order also found that Weingard’s issuance of the Furia 
audit reports violated Board Rule 2100, which implemented Section 102(a) of the Act. 
6 
        The order states that with respect to any new registration application Weingard submits after February 15, 
2006, the Board will not issue a notice of hearing to determine whether to approve or disapprove such application 
based solely on the violations subject to the Board’s order.  Id. 
7 
        A violation of the Act or any rule that the Board issues under the Act is treated for all purposes in the same 
manner as a violation of the Exchange Act, including with respect to penalties.  Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 15 
U.S.C.A. § 7202(b)(1) (West 2002). 
8 
        Section 102(a) became effective “[b]eginning 180 days after the date of the determination of the 
Commission under Section 101(d)” of the Act that the Board was prepared to undertake its statutory responsibilities.  
The Commission made the required determination on April 25, 2003.  See Order Regarding Section 101(d) of the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Securities Act Release No. 8223, Exchange Act Release No. 47746, 2003 WL 
1956164  (Apr. 25, 2003). 
9 
        “Willfully” as used in this Order means intentionally committing the act that constitutes the violation. 
There is no requirement that the actor also be aware that he is violating a rule or statute.  See Wonsover v. SEC, 205 
F.3d 408, 414 (D.C. Cir. 2000); Tager v. SEC, 344 F.2d 5, 8 (2d Cir. 1965).

D. FINDI      NGS 

       Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that Weingard willfully violated Section 
102(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 

E.     UNDERTAKING 

       Respondent has undertaken not to request, demand, or accept, directly or indirectly, any 
compensation from Furia in connection with the audit work associated with the Furia audit reports.  
In determining whether to accept the Offer, the Commission has considered this undertaking. 

                                              IV. 

       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in Respondent’s Offer. 

       Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that: 

       A.     Weingard shall cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any 
future violations of Section 102(a) of the Act. 

       B. W      eingard is censured. 

       C.     Weingard may practice before the Commission as an independent accountant 
provided that: 

              1.      The public accounting firm with which he is associated is registered with 
the Board in accordance with the Act, and such registration continues to be effective; and 

              2.      He has submitted to the Commission staff (attention: Office of the Chief 
Accountant) the Board’s letter notifying the public accounting firm with which he is associated 
that its registration application has been approved. 

 By       the Commission.
