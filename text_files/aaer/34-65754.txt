                                               II. 
 
       In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer

                                               III. 
 
       On the basis of this Order and Respondents Offer, the Commission finds that:  
 
              1.      Des Champs, age 46, of Las Vegas, Nevada, served as the  Chief Accounting

2000 to March 2005; as Ballys Chief Financial Officer (CFO) from March 2005 to March 2006; 
and as Ballys Senior Vice President, Business Analysis, from March 2006 to November 2006.  Des

December 1990 until December 2008.  
 
              2.      Bally Technologies is a Nevada corporation headquartered in Las Vegas, 
Nevada whose common stock during the relevant period was registered with the Commission under 
Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and traded on the New 
York Stock Exchange.  Ballys primary business is the design, manufacture, and sale of gaming 
machines and related casino monitoring systems.  
        
              3.      On October 21, 2011, a final judgment of permanent injunction was entered 
by consent against Des Champs, permanently enjoining him from future violations of Sections 
17(a)(2) and (a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Rule 13a-14 of the 
Exchange Act, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 
13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a -13 thereunder, in the

interest in the amount of $47,655, and a civil penalty in the amount of $130,000.   
 

                                                                                                                                                             
the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or of the rules and regulations 
thereunder.

              4.      The Commissions complaint alleged, among other things, that Bally 
 materially misstated its revenue in its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003; its 
 Forms 10-Q for the quarters ended June 30, 2003, September 30, 2003, December 31, 2003, 
 December 31, 2004 and March 31, 2005; in Form S-8 registration statements filed May 7, 2004 
 and January 14, 2005; and in Forms 8-K filed August 5, 2003, October 15, 2003, January 15, 
 2004, February 1, 2005 and April 29, 2005.  The complaint alleged that in his positions as CAO 
 and CFO of Bally, Des Champs aided and abetted   Ballys violation of Section 13(a) of the 
 Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder, by providing substantial 
 assistance to an issuer that files false and misleading annual, quarterly, and current reports with 
 the Commission.  The complaint further alleged that Des Champs aided and abetted Ballys 
 violation of Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(A) by providing substantial assistance to an issuer 
 that fails to make or keep books, records, and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately 
 and fairly reflect the companys transactions and dispositions of its assets.  The complaint also 
 alleged that Des Champs violated Sections 17(a)(2) and (a)(3) of the Securities Act; and certified 
 Ballys Form 10 -K for the year ended June 30, 2005, and its Form 10-Q for the period ended 
 March 31, 2005, in violation of Exchange Act Rule 13a-14.  
  
                                              IV. 
                                                 
       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
impose the sanction agreed to in Respondents Offer. 
 
       Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that                                              : 
 
       A.     Des Champs is suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission as 
an accountant.  
 
       B.      After five years from the date of this Order, Respondent may request that the 
Commission consider his reinstatement by submitting an application (attention: Office of the 
Chief Accountant) to resume appearing or practicing before the Commission as: 
      
              1.      a preparer or reviewer, or a person responsible for the preparation or 
review, of any public companys financial statements that are filed with the Commission.  Such 
an application must satisfy the Commission that Respondents work in his  practice before the 
Commission will be reviewed either by the independent audit committee of the public company 
for which he works or in some other acceptable manner, as long as he  practices before the 
Commission in this capacity; and/or 
      
              2.      an independent accountant.  Such an application must satisfy the 
Commission that: 
      
                      (a)    Respondent, or the public accounting firm with which he is 
associated, is registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (Board) in 
accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and such registration continues to be effective; 

                                               3  
---------------------Page 4---------------------

 
 
                      (b)     Respondent, or the registered public accounting firm with which he 
is associated, has been inspected by the Board and that inspection did not identify any criticisms 
of or potential defects in the Respondents or the firms quality control system that would 
indicate that the Respondent will not rece ive appropriate supervision; 

                      (c)     Respondent has resolved all disciplinary issues with the Board, and 
has complied with all terms and conditions of any sanctions imposed by the Board (other than 
reinstatement by the Commission); and 
 
                      (d)     Respondent acknowledges his responsibility, as long as 
Respondent appears or practices before the Commission as an independent accountant, to 
comply with all requirements of the Commission and the Board, including, but not limited to, all 
requirements relating to registration, inspections, concurring partner reviews and quality control 
standards.   
      
       C.     The Commission will consider an application by Respondent to resume 
appearing or practicing before the Commission provided that his state CPA license is 
current and he has resolved all other disciplinary issues with the applicable state boards of 
accountancy.  However, if state licensure is dependent on reinstatement by the 
Commission, the Commission will consider an application on its other merits.  The 
Commissions review may include consideration of, in addition to the matters referenced 
above, any other matters relating to Respondents character, integrity, professional conduct, 
or qualifications to appear or practice before the Commission. 
 
       By the Commission.
