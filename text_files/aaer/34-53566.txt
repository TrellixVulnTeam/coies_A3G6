Respondent. 
 
                                                
 
                                           I. 
 
              The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) deems it appropriate that cease-
and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), against Netopia, Inc. (Netopia or Respondent).   
                                             
                                          II. 
 
              In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the Offer) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the 
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings 
herein, except as to the Commissions jurisdiction over it and the subject matter of these 
proceedings, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Cease-
and-Desist Proceedings, Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order Pursuant to 
Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Order), as set forth below.

                                               III. 
 
              On the basis of this Order and Respondents Offer, the Commission finds that:  
        
A.     Summary
        
       1.           This matter involves false financial reporting by Netopia, an Emeryville, California 
corporation providing broadband and wireless products and services.  On two separate occasions in 
2002 and 2003, Netopia sales personnel entered into improper side arrangements with a customer 
making the customers payment obligation contingent on future events.  As a result, Netopia 
reported significantly inflated revenue to the Commission and investors.  The first such transaction 
allowed Netopia to report one of the largest software sales in the Companys history, while the 
second transaction allowed Netopia to falsely report its first profitable quarter since the quarter 
ended June 30, 2000.   
        
       2             Even after senior Netopia executives learned information suggesting that revenue 
had been improperly recognized, the company failed to take appropriate action.  In a July 6, 2004, 
press release, Netopia falsely stated that one of the deals was being written off simply because the 
customer had failed to pay, when in fact the customer had no obligation to pay and the revenue 
should never have been recorded in the first place. 
        
B.      Respondent
        
       3.           Netopia, Inc. is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Emeryville, California that 
develops, markets and supports broadband and wireless products and services including both 
computer hardware and software.  Netopias common stock is registered with the Commission 
pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act.  Netopia was delisted from the NASDAQ Stock 
Market on October 20, 2004 as a result of its failure to file a 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 
2004.  Netopia stock is currently listed for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board System.   
 
C.     Netopias Improper Revenue Recognition
     
               Netopias Third Quarter 2002 Software Revenue Is Inflated By Nearly 14% 
               Due To An Improper Side Agreement With A Thinly-Capitalized Reseller.                                       
        
       4.           In 2002, Netopias sales force began negotiating the companys first sale to 
Interface Computer Communications (ICC), a computer reseller which developed databases and 
information technology infrastructure for the education sector.  On May 23, 2002, Netopia 
obtained a purchase order from ICC for approximately $1.6 million in software and related 
maintenance, one of the largest software sales in Netopias history.  Before placing the order, 
Netopia personnel and ICC agreed that payment to Netopia was contingent upon ICC receiving its 
payment from the school district it anticipated buying the software.  ICCs purchase order provided 
that ICC would make two payments, and that the second payment would be made upon receipt of a 
purchase order from the end user.     
        

                                                2 
---------------------Page 3---------------------

              5.           Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), revenue cannot be 
recognized if the customer is not obligated to pay.  Upon realizing that Netopia could not recognize 
revenue on the sale because payment was contingent upon the end user paying for the software 
from ICC, personnel in Netopias sales department whited out the contingency language on the 
purchase order and forwarded the altered purchase order to Netopias finance department.  While 
the sales personnel altered the purchase order, they orally re-affirmed the contingency with ICC.  
Netopia recognized approximately $1.6 million in revenue for the sale in the fiscal quarter ended 
June 30, 2002.   
        
       6.           In addition to the payment contingency in the side agreement, revenue recognition 
was improper under GAAP because Netopia did not have a reasonable basis to believe that it 
would collect from ICC.  In order to assess collectibility, among other things, Netopia performed a 
credit check which indicated that ICC qualified for at most $15,000 in credit  far lower that the 
$1.6 million order.  Contrary to the information available regarding collectibility, Netopia 
recognized revenue on this sale.    
        
        7.         Although ICC paid Netopia the first installment of approximately $800,000 in June 
2002, the remainder was paid only after ICC received payment from the school district the 
following quarter.   
        
       8.          On August 14, 2002, Netopia filed with the Commission its Form 10-Q for the 
quarter ended June 30.  The financial statements in the Form 10-Q improperly included 
approximately $750,000 in software license revenue from the ICC transaction.  As a result, 
Netopias software revenue was inflated by 13.7% and its operating loss was understated by 13%. 
 
               Netopia Enters Into A Second Contingent Transaction With The Reseller, 
               Allowing The Company To Falsely Report Its First-Ever Profitable Quarter.  
 
       9.           In late 2002, Netopia and ICC began working on a similar project for a different 
school district.  Netopia sales personnel had forecast a $750,000 purchase order from ICC by the 
end of the fiscal year ending September 30, 2003.  As the quarter drew to a close, however, 
Netopia learned that ICC would not be ready to place the order because the project had increased 
in scope and was still being negotiated.       
        
       10.        Not wanting to lose the revenue for the quarter, Netopia sales personnel asked the 
reseller to nonetheless submit a purchase order in the amount forecast.  On September 29, 2003, 
ICC issued a purchase order to Netopia in the amount of $750,400.  Netopia sales personnel 
entered into an oral side agreement providing that ICC would not pay Netopia unless and until it 
received its payment from the end user school district.  At this point the large deal between ICC 
and the school district was in the preliminary stages.   
        
       11.        On October 7, 2003, ICC sent a side letter to Netopias sales personnel confirming 
the payment contingency and stating that in the event the end user decided not to purchase the 
Netopia software, ICC would owe no money to Netopia.  The letter was not forwarded to 

                                                3 
---------------------Page 4---------------------

Netopias finance department nor was it informed of the oral agreement, and, as a result, revenue 
from the contingent transaction was recognized by Netopia in violation of GAAP.  
        
       12.        On December 19, 2003, Netopia filed with the Commission its Form 10-K for the 
fiscal year ended September 30, 2003.  The financial statements in the Form 10-K improperly 
included approximately $750,000 in software license, maintenance and deferred revenue from the 
second ICC transaction.  As a result, Netopias software revenue for the quarter was overstated by 
16%, and the Company falsely reported operating income of $302,000 (rather than operating losses 
of $433,000)  Netopias first reported quarterly profit since the quarter ended June 30, 2000. 
        
              Netopia Issues a Misleading Press Release After Senior Executives 
              Discover The September Side Agreement.                           
        
       13.        By April 2004, Netopia and ICC had yet to complete the larger school district deal 
contemplated in September 2003, and ICC had failed to make any payments on the $750,000 
order.  Sometime thereafter, while attempting to collect the receivable, Netopia senior executives 
learned of the side agreement making ICCs payment contingent on payment from the school 
district.  Nevertheless, rather than reverse the revenue from the Companys 2003 financial 
statements, as required by GAAP, on July 6, 2004, the Company issued a misleading press release 
falsely describing ICCs lack of payment as a bad debt.  The Company also filed the press 
release with the Commission as an exhibit to a Form 8-K. 
 
D.     The Restatement and Subsequent Events
 
       14.        On July 12, 2004, Netopias Audit Committee obtained a copy of the October 7, 
2003 side letter.  On July 22, 2004, after the close of the market, Netopia announced that it was 
conducting an internal investigation.  The day after the Company made the announcement, its 
stock price dropped from $4.31 to $3.60 a share (a 16% decline). 
        
       15.        Following an internal investigation by Netopias audit committee, on February 1, 
2005, Netopia restated its financial statements primarily based on the two software transactions.  
For the first transaction, recorded as revenue in the quarter ended June 30, 2002, Netopia 
eliminated $750,000 (of approximately $1.6 million originally recorded) of software license 
revenue and deferred $632,000 of such revenue to the following quarter.  The elimination of the 
revenue on the first ICC transaction alone resulted in restated revenue for software and services of 
$4.7 million compared with previously reported revenue of $5.5 million (a 13.7% overstatement), 
and an increase of operating losses from the previously-reported $4.9 million to $ 5.7 million (a 
13% understatement).   For the second transaction, recorded as revenue in the quarter ended 
September 30, 2003, Netopia eliminated software license, maintenance and deferred revenue of 
$750,400.  This restatement of the second ICC transaction alone resulted in restated revenue for 
software and services of $3.9 million compared with previously-reported revenue of $4.7 million 
(a 16% overstatement) and restated operating losses of $433,000 compared to previously-reported 
operating income of $302,000 (a 243% overstatement).

E.      Legal Conclusions 
         
        16.        As a result of the conduct described above, Netopia failed to file with the 
Commission accurate and complete reports, including Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, and filed reports 
that failed to include material information necessary to make its statements not misleading.   
         
              17.        Because Netopia improperly recorded revenue, its books, records and accounts did 
not, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect its transactions, revenues and net income or 
loss.  In addition, Netopia failed to implement internal accounting controls relating to its revenue 
accounts which were sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that these accounts were 
accurately stated in accordance with GAAP.       
 
              18.        As a result of the conduct described above, the Company violated Sections 13(a), 
13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 
thereunder. 
  
                                                      IV. 
                                                        
        In determining to accept the Offer, the Commission considered remedial acts promptly 
undertaken by the Respondent and cooperation afforded the Commission staff. 
 
                                                      V. 
                                                        
              In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate accept the Offer submitted 
by the Respondent Netopia. 
 
        Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that: 
 
              A.          Respondent Netopia cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and 
any future violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 
12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder. 
 
                                                        
 
          
 By the Commission.
