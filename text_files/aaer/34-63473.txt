                                                II. 
 
              In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the Offer) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the 
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings 
herein, except as to the Commissions jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these 
proceedings, and the findings contained in Section III.3 below, which are admitted, Respondent 
consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Rule 102(e) 
of the Commissions Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions 
(Order), as set forth below.   
 
                                               III. 
 
              On the basis of this Order and Respondents Offer, the Commission finds that:  
 
                     1.           Beckwith, age 38, is and has been a certified public accountant licensed to 
practice in the State of Utah.  He served as an assistant controller of TheraDoc, Inc. (TheraDoc), a 
subsidiary of Hospira, Inc. (Hospira), from at least February 2009 until September 28, 2010. 
        
                     2.           Hospira is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in 
Lake Forest, Illinois.  Hospira is a global specialty pharmaceutical and medication delivery 
company with worldwide sales of approximately $3.9 billion.  Hospira acquired TheraDoc in 
December 2009 for a purchase price of $63.3 million.  At all relevant times, Hospiras common 
stock was registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934 (Exchange Act), and traded on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 
                     3.           On October 14, 2010 a final judgment was entered against Beckwith, 
permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and 
Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and aiding and abetting violations of Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange 
Act in the civil action entitled Securities and Exchange Commission v. Paul R. Beckwith, et al., 
Civil Action Number 1:10-CV-00162, in the United States District Court for the District of Utah. 
 
                            4.           The Commissions complaint alleged, among other things, that beginning 
 in at least July 2009, Beckwith began systematically withdrawing funds from TheraDocs 
 operating account and depositing them into an account under the name of Paul Beckwith CPAs.  
 Upon transferring the misappropriated funds to Beckwith CPAs account, the complaint alleged 
 that Beckwith then made further transfers from that account into his personal checking and 
 savings accounts and then transferred funds to an account maintained at a national broker-dealer 
 for his personal use.  The complaint further alleges that Beckwith provided false reconciliation 
 records to Hospiras internal accounting department and generated false reconciliation 
 spreadsheets that did not reflect his withdrawals and deposits and also provided Hospiras 
 accountants with bank records that deleted the records of the withdrawals that he made.

               In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
impose the sanction agreed to in Respondent Beckwiths Offer. 
 
               Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that: 
 
Beckwith is suspended from appearing or practicing before the Co                                                                        mmission as an accountant.   
                                
 By the Commission.
