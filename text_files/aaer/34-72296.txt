       On May  29, 2014, Respondents Ernst & Young Hua Ming LLP , KPMG Huazhen 
(Special General Partnership), Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Certified Public Accountants, 
Ltd., PricewaterhouseCoopers Zhong Ti  an CPAs Limited (collectively the Big Four 
Respondents), and the Division of Enforcement (Division), jointly requested a 90-day 
extension to the briefing schedule  s set by the Commission  by orders dated May 9, 2014.1
                                                                                     
The Division represents that Respondent BDO China Dahua  CPA  Co.  Ltd. (Dahua) 
agrees with the proposed extension.  
  
       In support of their motion, the Division and the Big Four Respondents state that 
the 90-day extension would facilitate the parties continued settlement efforts and

Act Release No. 72140, 2014 WL 1871078,  at *5 (May 9, 2014);  Order Denying the  Divisions Motion to

because continuing these talks while briefing the appeal would present challenges, given 
the breadth, complexity, and sensitivity of the issues involved.  The Division further 
states that although settlement discussions to date have not included Dahua, the 
resolution of some or all of the proceedings with respect to the Big Four Respondents 
could affect issues regarding remedies that would be addressed by the Dahua-related 
briefing. 
 
       Extensions of time are disfavored.  It appears appropriate, however, to grant the 
requested extension.  Therefore,  
 
       It is ORDERED that the briefing schedule is extended  as follows: 
 
       September 19, 2014:  Big Four   Respondents consolidated opening brief; the 
       Divisions opening brief (as to remedies imposed on Dahua). 
        
       November 4, 2014:  Divisions principal brief and response to Big Four 
       Respondents opening brief; Dahuas response brief to the Divisions opening 
       brief (as to remedies imposed by Dahua). 
        
       November 25, 2014:  Big Four Respondents single consolidated respons    e and 
       reply brief. 
        
       December 11, 2014:  Divisions reply brief (as to the Divisions Petition for 
       review). 
        
       For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.
