       On December 12, 2014, Respondents Ernst & Young Hua Ming LLP, KPMG 
Huazhen (Special General Partnership), Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Certified Public 
Accountants, Ltd., Pricewaterhousecoopers Zhong Tian CPAs Limited (collectively the 
“Big Four Respondents”), and the Division of Enforcement (“Division”), jointly 
requested an approximately 70-day extension to the briefing schedule set by the 
                                                1
Commission by order dated October 22, 2014.        The Division represents that Respondent 
BDO China Dahua     CPA  Co. , Ltd.  agrees   with the proposed extension.  
  
       In support of their motion, the Division  and the Big Four Respondents state that  , 
the substantial progress already made towards   settlement  has increased significantly; 
however, the multi -party nature of the negotiations, the importance, complexity and 
sensitivity of the matters under discussion, and the legal and cross-border regulatory 
issues presented have continued to require significant tim e and care to discuss.  The 
Division and Big Four Respondents now anticipate that this will b   e the final extension

request.  The parties jointly seek an additional extension of all briefing schedules of 
approximately 70-days. 
        
       Extensions of time are disfavored.  It appears appropriate, however, to grant the 
requested extension.  Therefore,  
 
       It is ORDERED that the briefing schedule is extended as follows: 
 
       February 26, 2015:  Big Four Respondents’ consolidated opening brief; the 
       Division’s opening brief (as to remedies imposed on Dahua). 
        
       April 21, 2015:  Division’s principal brief and response to Big Four Respondents’ 
       opening brief; Dahua’s response brief to the Division’s opening brief (as to 
       remedies imposed by Dahua).
