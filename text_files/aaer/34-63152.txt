       The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) deems it appropriate that 
cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), against Office Depot, Inc. (Respondent).1
                                                                                                 
        
                                             II. 
                                                
              In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (Offer) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the purpose 
of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the Commission, or to 
which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings herein, except as 
to the Commissions jurisdiction over it and the subject matter of these proceedings, which are 
admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist

                                               III. 
                                                  
              On the basis of this Order and Respondents Offer, the Commission finds2
                                                                                   that:   
 
                                            Summary 
                                                  
       1.           Office Depot violated Regulation FD in 2007 by selectively communicating to 
analysts that it would not meet analysts quarterly earnings estimates for Office Depot.  After a 
discussion between the companys Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and then-Chief Financial 
Officer (CFO), Office Depot conducted one-on-one calls with the analysts late in the second 
quarter of 2007.  The company did not directly tell the analysts that it would not meet their 
expectations; rather, this message was signaled through its references to recent public statements 
of comparable companies about the impact of the slowing economy on their earnings, and 
reminders of Office Depots prior cautionary public statements.  The analysts promptly lowered 
their estimates for the period.  The CFO assisted in preparing the talking points for the calls.  The 
CFO and the CEO were aware of the declining estimates while the company made the calls, and 
they encouraged the calls to be completed.  The company also continued to make the calls 
despite the CFO being notified of some analysts concerns of, among other things, the lack of 
public disclosure.  Six days after the calls began, Office Depot filed a Form 8-K announcing to 
the market, among other things, that its sales and earnings would be negatively impacted due to a 
continued soft economy.  Prior to that Form 8-K, Office Depots share price had significantly 
dropped on increased trading volume.   

       2.           Unrelated to the conduct above, Office Depot overstated its net earnings in its 
financial statements for the third quarter of 2006 through the second quarter of 2007 as a result 
of accounting violations.  Office Depot prematurely recognized approximately $30 million in 
funds received from vendors in exchange for the companys merchandising and marketing 
efforts instead of recognizing the funds over the relevant reporting periods in a manner consistent 
with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).  In November 2007, the company 
restated the above financials and announced a material weakness in its internal controls over 
financial reporting, resulting from the failure of its personnel responsible for negotiating 
agreements with vendors to communicate all of the relevant information to accounting personnel.  
As a result of this conduct, Office Depot violated Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of 
the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder.    
 
                                          Respondent 
        
       3.      Office Depot, a Delaware corporation based in Boca Raton, Florida, is an office 
products supplier.   Office Depots common stock is registered with the Commission pursuant to 
Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and is traded on the New York Stock Exchange.

 The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondents Offer of Settlement and are not binding on any other 
person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

                                         Background 
                                                 
       A. Regulation FD Violation 
        
       4.           Office Depot, as a company policy, did not offer specific quarterly earnings 
guidance during the relevant time period.  In late 2006 and early 2007, the CEO and the CFO 
believed the significant earnings per share (EPS) growth the company achieved in 2005 and 
early 2006 was not sustainable and set out to temper analysts expectations.  In February 2007, 
during a publicly broadcasted earnings conference call, the CEO and the CFO described Office 
Depots business model, which contemplated mid to upper teens EPS growth over the long-term.  
On another public conference call in late April 2007, the company warned investors that its 
largest business segments were facing a softening in demand that was continuing into the second 
quarter.  Shortly following the analysts publication of EPS estimates for Office Depot in late 
April (when most analysts lowered their estimates for Office Depot), the company reiterated at a 
publicly available investor conference in early May that its business model contemplated only 
mid to upper teens EPS growth over the long-term and that the company faced a softening 
demand environment.    
  
       5.     On May 31, 2007, the CEO alerted Office Depots board of directors and the 
executive committee that the company would not likely meet the analysts consensus $0.48 EPS 
estimate for the second quarter and that senior management was discussing a strategy for 
advance communication to avoid a complete surprise to the market.   
        
       6.           Office Depot did not have written Regulation FD policies or procedures at the 
time.  The company had also never conducted any formal Regulation FD training prior to June 
2007, although its general counsel had occasionally distributed guidance and updates on 
Regulation FD.   
 
                       Office Depots Selective Disclosures to Analysts 
 
       7.           In early June 2007, in response to the CEOs May 31, 2007 notice to the board of 
directors, the CFO instructed the director of investor relations and his immediate supervisor to 
prepare a draft press release for her review previewing certain second quarter earnings 
information should the company later determine to issue one.  By mid June 2007, certain of the 
companys preliminary internal estimates forecasted up to $0.44 EPS for the quarter.  The CFO 
and CEO were uncomfortable with issuing a press release because the companys internal 
estimates were incomplete at this point.   
 
       8.           On June 20, 2007, ten days prior to the close of Office Depots second quarter for 
2007, the CEO and the CFO, both of whom had investor relations experience, discussed how to 
encourage analysts to revisit their analysis of the company.  The CEO, in an attempt to get 
analysts to lower their estimates, proposed to the CFO that the company talk to the analysts and 
refer them to recent earnings announcements by two comparable companies that had recently 
publicly announced results which were impacted by the slowing economy.  The CEO further 

                                               3 
---------------------Page 4---------------------

   
suggested that Office Depot point out on the calls what the company had said to the market in 
April and May 2007.  The CEO and the CFO jointly decided to adopt this approach.  The CEO 
believed that if the analysts looked at Office Depot again in that light, they would come to the 
point of view that their estimates were too high and likely would lower them.   
        
       9.           The CFO, the director of investor relations, and the directors immediate 
supervisor drafted talking points, based in part on the CEOs suggestions, for use as a guide for 
the calls with analysts.  The CEO was not asked to review the talking points and did not do so.  
The agreed upon talking points are set forth below. 
        
             Havent spoken in a while, just want to touch base.  
             At beg. of Qtr weve talked about a number of head winds that we were 
              facing this quarter including a softening economy, especially at small end. 
             I think the earnings release we have seen from the likes of [Company A], 
              [Company B], and [Company C] have been interesting. 
                •   On a sequential basis, [Company A] and [Company B] domestic 
                   comps were down substantially over prior quarters.  
                •  [Company C] mentioned economic conditions as a reason for their 
                   slowed growth.   
             Some have pointed to better conditions in the second half of the year  
              however who knows? 
             Remind you that economic model contemplates stable economic 
              conditions  that is midteens growth 
        
       10.        On Friday, June 22, 2007, and the following Monday, June 25, 2007, the director 
of investor relations spoke individually with all 18 analysts covering Office Depot and conveyed 
to them the information contained in the talking points.  Office Depot did not regularly initiate 
calls of this type to all 18 analysts covering the company.  Word of these calls quickly spread 
among analysts, some of whom believed that Office Depot was talking down analysts 
earnings estimates.   

       11.        The CFO and the CEO were in communication with the director of investor 
relations during and after the calls.  On Saturday, June 23, 2007, the CFO emailed the analysts 
revised estimates to the CEO and advised that the director of investor relations had spoken to 
most of the companys analysts and that two had reduced their estimates.  The CEO responded 
positively and encouraged the calls to continue so that additional analysts would lower their 
estimates.  On Monday, June 25, 2007, the CFO asked the director of investor relations 
immediate supervisor whether the director of investor relations had contacted a particular analyst 
whose EPS estimate was the highest and had not yet been revised.  Also on Monday, the CEO 
requested and received an update, which showed that the analysts consensus estimate was still 
$0.46.  With the CFOs knowledge, the CEO then commented to the director of investor relations 
that they still needed conversations with a few more analysts. 

                                               4 
---------------------Page 5---------------------

   
       12.        Office Depots calls influenced many analysts to revise and lower their second 
quarter 2007 forecasts.  By the end of the second day of the calls, fifteen of the eighteen analysts 
lowered their estimates, bringing the consensus estimate down from $0.48 to $0.45.   
                                                  
         Analyst and Investor Reaction to Calls and Calls to Institutional Investors 
 
       13.        During a call on Friday, June 22, 2007, one analyst expressed concern to the 
director of investor relations about the lack of a press release.  That same day, the director of 
investor relations conveyed to the CFO this concern and that one other analyst was informing his 
customers that he expected Office Depots earnings to be down based on his call.   
        
       14.        On Monday, June 25, 2007, the director of investor relations notified the CFO that 
another analyst told him that he was surprised at the lack of a press release and indicated that 
several of his clients were also surprised.  Also, late Monday evening, the CFO instructed the 
director of investor relations to call the companys top twenty institutional investors and relay the 
same talking points to them, which he did the following day. 
        
                                   Office Depot Files an 8-K 
                                                  
       15.        After the close of the market on Thursday, June 28, 2007, six days after the calls 
to analysts began, Office Depot filed a Form 8-K publicly disclosing, among other things, that its 
earnings would be negatively impacted due to continued soft economic conditions.   
                                                  
                                        Market Reaction 
        
       16.        Between Friday, June 22, 2007 (the day Office Depot began calling analysts) and 
June 28, 2007 (the last market close before Office Depot filed its 8-K), the companys stock 
dropped 7.7%.  On the first day of the calls, Office Depots stock closed at $33.49 per share.  
This was a decrease of 2.8% from the previous close, on trading volume of almost 7.5 million 
shares, which was two and half times the average volume for the remainder of that week.  On the 
second day of calls, the stock dropped another 3.5% to $32.32 per share on trading volume of 7 
million shares. 
        
       B.          Books, Records, and Internal Controls Violations 
        
       17.        Office Depot often arranges with its vendors to receive funding for its various 
marketing and promotional activities relating to the vendors products, such as advertising, store 
displays, and product exclusivity.  For example, vendors frequently pay Office Depot to place 
their products in prominent store locations.   
 
       18.        Under GAAP, the funds from these agreements are recognizable during the 
reporting period in which Office Depot provides the marketing and promotional activities called 
for in the agreements.  When the activities cover multiple reporting periods, the funds are to be 
recognized over the relevant reporting periods in a manner consistent with GAAP. 

                                                5 
---------------------Page 6---------------------

   
        
       19.        Between the third quarter of 2006 and the second quarter of 2007, Office Depot 
prematurely recognized funds from approximately 100 vendor agreements.  Many of the 
transactions involved an email arrangement between Office Depot personnel and the vendors that 
were separate from, but in addition to, the original documented agreement.  These supplemental 
agreements often included terms that bound Office Depot to some kind of future performance 
and thus, would have caused the recognition of these funds to be deferred into future periods.  
The premature recognition of vendor funds inflated Office Depots operating profit from the 
third quarter of 2006 through the second quarter of 2007 by a total of approximately $30 million.  
Office Depots quarterly and annual financial statements during this period overstated net 
earnings by 1.3% to 6.7%. 
 
       20.        In November 2007, Office Depot announced that it would be restating its 
financial statements for the third quarter of 2006 through the second quarter of 2007 due to 
material errors in the accounting recognition of vendor funds that should have been deferred into 
later periods.  The company also announced having a material weakness in its internal controls 
over financial reporting based on the failure to ensure that complete and accurate documentation 
was provided to individuals responsible for the proper recognition of vendor funds. 
 
       21.        The accounting errors leading to Office Depots restatements resulted from a 
communication breakdown between the Office Depot personnel responsible for negotiating and 
executing vendor agreements (internally referred to at Office Depot as Merchants) and the 
personnel responsible for accounting for the funds.  During either the negotiation or execution of 
vendor agreements, the Merchants often had email or other communications with the vendors 
that modified the terms of existing agreements.  However, the Merchants often failed to provide 
all of the documentation to the accounting department for consideration. 
                                                 
                                           Violations 
 
              Violations of Regulation FD and Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act 

       22.        Regulation FD prohibits issuers or persons acting on their behalf from disclosing 
material nonpublic information to securities analysts, institutional investors, or other enumerated 
persons without disclosing that information to the public.  See generally Regulation FD, Rule 
100; Final Rule: Selective Disclosure and Insider Trading, Exchange Act Rel. No. 43154, 65 
Fed. Reg. 51,716 (Aug. 15, 2000) (Adopting Release).  Where a selective disclosure of 
material nonpublic information is intentional, issuers must make a public disclosure 
simultaneously with the selective disclosure.  Regulation FD, Rule 100(a)(1).  Intentional means 
when the person making the disclosure either knows, or is reckless in not knowing, that the 
information he or she is communicating is both material and nonpublic.  Regulation FD, Rule 
101(a).  Where the selective disclosure is non-intentional, Regulation FD requires issuers to 
make a public disclosure of the information promptly after a senior official of the issuer learns of 
the non-intentional disclosure.  Rules 100(a)(2) & 101(d).  Regulation FD defines promptly to 

                                                6 
---------------------Page 7---------------------

   
mean as soon as reasonably practicable (but in no event after the later of 24 hours or the 
commencement of the next days trading on the New York Stock Exchange).  Rule 101(d).   

       23.        An issuers failure to make a required public disclosure pursuant to Regulation 
FD constitutes a violation of both Regulation FD and Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act.  See 
Adopting Release, 65 Fed. Reg. at 51,726.   

       24.        The Commission adopted Regulation FD out of concern that issuers were 
disclosing important nonpublic information, such as advance warnings of earnings results, to 
securities analysts or selected institutional investors or both, before making full disclosure of the 
same information to the general public.  Id. at 51,716.  The Commission explained in the 
Adopting Release:  

           When an issuer official engages in a private discussion with an analyst 
           who is seeking guidance about earnings estimates, he or she takes on a 
           high degree of risk under Regulation FD.  If the issuer official 
           communicates selectively to the analyst nonpublic information that the 
           companys anticipated earnings will be higher than, lower than, or even 
           the same as what analysts have been forecasting, the issuer likely will 
           have violated Regulation FD.  This is true whether the information about 
           earnings is communicated expressly or through indirect guidance, the 
           meaning of which is apparent though implied.  

Id. at 51,721.   

       25.        Furthermore, the Division of Corporation Finance has stated in its interpretations 
of Regulation FD that a confirmation of expected quarterly earnings made near the end of a 
quarter might convey information about how the issuer actually performed.  In that respect, the 
inference a reasonable investor may draw from such a confirmation may differ significantly from 
the inference he or she may have drawn from the original forecast early in the quarter.  Division 
of Corporation Finance: Manual of Publicly Available Telephone Interpretations, Regulation FD, 
Item 1 (4th 
           supp., May 2001) (Telephone Interpretations).  (On August 14, 2009, the 
Telephone Interpretations regarding Regulation FD were migrated over to the Compliance & 
Disclosure Interpretation format.) 
        
       26.        As a result of the conduct described above, Office Depot violated Regulation FD 
and Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act.  
        
              Violations of the Books and Records and Internal Controls Provisions 

       27.        Also as a result of the conduct described above, Office Depot violated Section 
13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder, which require every 
issuer of a security registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act file with the 
Commission information, documents, and annual and quarterly reports as the Commission may 

                                                7 
---------------------Page 8---------------------

   
require, and mandate that periodic reports contain such further material information as may be 
necessary to make the required statements not misleading.  

              28.        Because Office Depot improperly recognized funds from its vendor agreements, 
its books, records and accounts did not, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect its 
transactions and dispositions of assets. 

              29.        In addition, Office Depot failed to implement internal accounting controls relating 
to its vendor agreements which were sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that its accounts 
were accurately stated in accordance with GAAP.       

              30.        As a result of the conduct described above, Office Depot violated Section 
13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act, which requires reporting companies to make and keep books, 
records, and accounts which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect their transactions 
and dispositions of their assets.  

              31.        Lastly, as a result of the conduct described above, Office Depot violated Section

system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance 
with GAAP.

undertaken by Respondent and cooperation afforded the Commission staff.

       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in Respondents Offer.  
        
       Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, 
Respondent Office Depot cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any 
future violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 
12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder, and Regulation FD. 
        
        
By the Commission.
