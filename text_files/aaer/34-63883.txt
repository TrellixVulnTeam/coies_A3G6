              The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) deems it appropriate that 
cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against ArthroCare Corporation 
(ArthroCare or Respondent) pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(Exchange Act). 
 
                                          II. 
 
              In anticipation of these proceedings, ArthroCare has submitted an Offer of Settlement 
(the Offer) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the purpose of these 
proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the Commission, or to which 
the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings herein, except as to the 
Commissions jurisdiction over it and the subject matter of these proceedings, which are 
admitted, ArthroCare consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist 
Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, 
and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order (Order), as set forth below.

                                                 III. 
 
              On the basis of this Order and Respondents Offer, the Commission finds1
                                                                                      that: 
 
  
1.         Respondent ArthroCare is a Delaware corp      oration headquartered in Austin, Texas.  
ArthroCares stock is registered under Sectio  n 12(b) of the Exchange Act and is traded on 
NASDAQ.  ArthroCare is a medi cal device company that deve lops, manufactures and markets 
surgical products, including products with the       trade name SpineWands that were used by 
surgeons in the treatment of patients with spinal injuries. 
 
2.           DiscoCare, Inc. was a privately owned Delaware corporation incorporated in 2005.  
Based in Palm Beach, Florida, DiscoCare distributed ArthroCare products (especially 
SpineWands) until December 31, 2007, when it was acquired by ArthroCare.  ArthroCare was 
DiscoCares only supplier.  At various times, DiscoCare was ArthroCares largest distributor of 
SpineWands. 
 
3.           Between the fourth quarter of 2005 and the first quarter of 2008 (the restatement 
period), ArthroCare materially overstated and prematurely recognized revenue, primarily on 
sales of SpineWands to certain of ArthroCares agents and distributors, including DiscoCare.  
Most of these transactions occurred at or near quarter-end and were intended to help the 
company reach aggressive internal revenue targets and satisfy analysts revenue expectations.  
ArthroCare lacked an effective system of internal controls over sales, particularly with respect to 
its Spine Business Unit, where most of the improprieties occurred.  This allowed ArthroCare 
sales personnel to withhold critical information on revenue recognition from the companys 
accounting staff.     
 
4.           During the restatement period, ArthroCare repeatedly turned to DiscoCare to help it 
overcome quarterly revenue shortfalls, by recording revenue from large orders shipped to 
DiscoCare at or near quarter-end.  ArthroCare should not have recognized revenue from these 
shipments.  The orders were initiated by ArthroCare employees for the purpose of filling 
shortfalls in meeting internal and external revenue targets.  DiscoCare had no need for the 
excessive inventory and no reasonable likelihood of selling the products within a reasonable 
timeframe.  Furthermore, ArthroCare accommodated DiscoCare by providing significantly 
extended payment terms, while also explicitly or impliedly agreeing that DiscoCare did not have 
to pay for the products until it had sufficient funds to do so.2
                                                                 
 
5.           In addition, shortly after the close of the second quarter of 2006, ArthroCare employees 
arranged for DiscoCare to return products shipped just before quarter-end, while concealing from

 The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent's Offer of Settlement and are not binding on any other person 
or entity in this or any other proceeding.   
2
 See Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 48, Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists (FAS 
48), ¶ 6(b), which requires the buyer to have paid the seller, or the buyer  to be obligated to pay the seller and the 
obligation not to be contingent on resale of the product, and ¶ 22, which clarifies ¶ 6(b) and provides   if  the 
buyers obligation to pay is contractually or implicitly excused until the buyer resells the product, then the condition 
(for recording revenue in ¶6(b)) is not met. 
                                                  2 
 
---------------------Page 3---------------------

                                                                                                        

ArthroCares accounting staff the true reason for the product return.  In fact, ArthroCare 
requested the product return only because the shipment had caused ArthroCare to exceed 
securities analysts revenue targets, and the employees were concerned that this would cause 
analysts to set the next quarters estimates too high.  ArthroCares recognition of revenue from 
sales to DiscoCare violated Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).         3
                                                                                           
 
6.           ArthroCare also inflated revenue by mischaracterizing volume-based commission 
payments to distributors as fees for services.  This enabled ArthroCare to record the gross 
amount of the sale as revenue and expense the commission, rather than recording the net revenue 
of the sale, as required by GAAP.  4
                                       
 
7.           Finally, on several occasions during the restatement period, ArthroCare recognized 
revenue from shipments of products to customers that did not conform to the customers orders.  
ArthroCare also recognized revenue from products that it shipped after the products expiration 
date had passed, which meant the products were not usable by an ultimate customer and 
therefore immediately returnable.  ArthroCares recognition of revenue from these sales violated 
GAAP.  5
         
 
8.           As a result of the conduct described above, ArthroCare violated Section 13(a) of the 
Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1, 13a-13 and 12b-20 thereunder, which require every issuer of a 
security registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act to file with the Commission 
information, documents, and annual and quarterly reports as the Commission may require, and 
mandate that periodic reports contain such further material information as may be necessary to 
make the required statements not misleading. 
        
9.          As detailed above, ArthroCares books, records, and accounts did not, in reasonable 
detail, properly reflect its sales and payments to distributors.  As a result, ArthroCare violated 
Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(A). 
        
10.        In addition, ArthroCare failed to implement internal accounting controls relating to 
distributor sales to ensure these sales were accurately stated in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles and accurately reflected on its books and records.  As a result, 
ArthroCare violated Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(B).

 FAS 48, ¶ 6(b); see also Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 5 (CON 5), ¶¶ 83-84, which states  
that revenues cannot be recognized until they are realized/realizable and earned.  Revenues are realized when 
products (goods or services), merchandise, or other assets are exchanged for cash or claims to cash.  Revenues are 
earned when the entity has substantially accomplished what it must do to be entitled to the benefits represented by 
the revenues.  An entitys revenue-earning activities involve delivering or producing goods, rendering services, or 
other activities that constitute its on-going major or central operations; cf. AICPA Statement of Position 97-2, 
Software Revenue Recognition, (SOP 97-2), ¶ 8.

                                   Cooperation and Remediation 
 
              In determining to accept the Offer, the Commission considered remedial acts undertaken 
by ArthroCare and the substantial cooperation provided by the company in connection with the 
Commissions investigation.  
 
        ArthroCare replaced its senior management team.  In addition, ArthroCare (i) expanded 
its legal department and created a compliance department led by a newly hired Compliance 
Officer; (ii) hired a new Corporate Controller and International Controller, (iii) expanded its 
internal audit function; (iv) instituted enhanced preventative and detective controls relating to 
revenue recognition; (v) instituted quarterly ethics communications from senior management to 
employees; (vi) implemented a sub-certification process as part of its quarterly and annual 
financial reporting; (vii) adopted standard customer contracts and established rigorous approval 
requirements for modifying contracts; (viii) hired a contract administrator; and (ix) provided 
regular training on proper revenue recognition accounting and appropriate procedures for 
handling contracts. 
         
        During the investigation, ArthroCare (i) regularly updated the staff on its internal 
investigation; (ii) provided critical documents (organized by subject matter and witness) without 
waiting for staff requests or subpoenas; (iii) responded promptly and completely to the staffs 
requests for additional information; (iv) routinely granted the staff access to the companys 
consulting expert to discuss accounting and internal controls issues; (v) voluntarily produced for 
testimony witnesses who resided outside the United States and were beyond the staffs subpoena 
power; and (vi) provided the staff with a detailed analysis of its restatement, including a schedule 
of restatement categories and the impact on the companys historical financial statements.   
                                                      
                                                   IV. 
 
              In view of the foregoing, the Commission   deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in ArthroCares Offer. 
 
              Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that: 
 
        Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, ArthroCare cease and desist from 
committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) 
and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder. 
 
              By the Commission.
