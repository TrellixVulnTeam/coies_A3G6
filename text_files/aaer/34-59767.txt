                                       I.  
 
      The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate 
that cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C 
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), against Stratum Holdings, Inc. 
(“Stratum” or “Respondent”).   
                                         
                                       II.  
 
      In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted 
an Offer of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept.  
Solely for the purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on  
behalf of the Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting 
or denying the findings herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over it and the 
subject matter of these proceedings, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry 
of this Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist 
Order (“Order”), as set forth below.

                                            III. 
 
       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that: 
 
       1.      Stratum is a Nevada corporation located in Houston, Texas.  Stratum has 
two wholly-owned subsidiaries: CYMRI, LLC (“CYMRI”) and Decca Consulting Ltd. 
(“Decca”).  CYMRI owns working interests in roughly 70 operated and non-operated 
wells in South Texas and South Louisiana.  Decca provides consulting services to the 
Canadian energy market.  The company’s common stock (symbol “STTH”) is quoted on 
the OTC Bulletin Board and the Pink Sheets operated by Pink OTC Markets Inc. 
         
       2.      Stratum failed to comply with Items 307 and 308T of Regulation S-B in 
its 10-KSB report filed on April 8, 2008 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007, as 
a result of which the Respondent violated Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 
and 13a-15 of the Exchange Act thereunder.   

                                            IV. 
                                               
        In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the 
sanctions agreed to in Respondent Stratum’s Offer. 
 
        Accordingly, it is hereby  ORDERED that:  
 
       Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Respondent Stratum cease and desist  
from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Section 13(a) of the 
Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-15 thereunder.   
 
 
 
 
       By the Commission.
