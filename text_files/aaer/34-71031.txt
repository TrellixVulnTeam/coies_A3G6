                                            I. 
 
      The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) deems it appropriate and in the 
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against Craig 
Toll (Respondent or Toll) pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(i) of the Commissions Rules of 
Practice.1

 Rule 102(e)(3)(i) provides, in relevant part, that:  
 
      The Commission, with due regard to the public interest and without preliminary hearing, 
may, by order, . . . suspend from appearing or practicing before it any . . . accountant . . . who has 
been by name . . . permanently enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction, by reason of his

                                               II. 
 
       In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Toll has submitted an Offer of 
Settlement (the Offer) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the purpose 
of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the Commission, or to 
which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings herein, except as 
to the Commissions jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these proceedings and the 
findings contained in Section III(2) below, which are admitted, Toll consents to the entry of this 
Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commissions Rules 
of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (Order), as set forth below.   
 
                                              III. 
 
       On the basis of this Order and Tolls Offer, the Commission finds that:  
 
              1.      Toll, 64, has been a certified public accountant licensed to practice in the 
State of Florida since 1980.  He served as Chief Financial Officer of InnoVida Holdings, LLC from 
approximately December 2007 until March 2011.  From 1994 until 1999, he was Chief Financial 
Officer of CHS Electronics, Inc., a publicly traded company. 
        
              2.      On December 7, 2012, the Commission filed a complaint against Toll and 
others in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, styled SEC v. Craig 
Toll, et al., Case No. 12-CV-24326.  On November 26, 2013, the District Court entered an order 
permanently enjoining Toll, by consent, from future violations of Sections 17(a) of the Securities 
Act of 1933 (Securities Act), and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934 (Exchange Act).  The Court also barred Toll from serving as an officer or director of a 
publicly traded company.    
 
              3.      Among other things, the Commissions complaint alleged that Toll, while 
 CFO of InnoVida Holdings, made misrepresentations and omissions to investors and prospective 
 investors in InnoVida Holdings by creating financial statements falsely inflating InnoVida 
 Holdings cash and valuation, which he and InnoVidas CEO used to attract investors to the 
 company.

                                               IV. 
                                                 
       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
impose the sanction agreed to in Respondent Tolls Offer.  
 
        
       Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that: 
 
       Toll is suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant.   
        
 
       By the Commission.
