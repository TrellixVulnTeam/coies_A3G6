       In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the “Offer”), wh ich the Comm ission has determ ined to accept.   Solely for the 
purpose of these pro  ceedings and  any other   proceedings brought by or on behalf of the

              The Commission, with due regard to the public interest and without preliminary hearing, 
       may, by order, . . . suspend from appearing or practicing before it any . . . accountant . . . who has

to Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial 
Sanctions (“Order”), as set forth below. 

                                              III. 

       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that: 

              A.      Foster, age 48, is a cer  tified public accountant in   the State of Texas. 
During the relevant time period, Foster was employed as Vice President of Taxation of Dynegy 
Inc. (“Dynegy”), and substantially participat  ed in a Dynegy financing transaction known as 
Project Alpha. 

              B.      Dynegy  is  an  Illinois  corporation headquartered in Hou  ston, Texas . 
Dynegy’s shares are registered with the Comm     ission under Section 12(b) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 and trade on the New York Stock Exchange. 

              C.      On Septe mber 24, 2002, the Comm  ission entered an order by consent 
against Dynegy resulting from  the company’s improper accounti ng and m isleading disclosures 
relating to Project Alpha.  Dynegy used Project Alpha to enhance cash flow from  operations by 
$300 million in 2001 and to achieve a related $79 million tax benefit.  Dynegy failed to disclose 
properly the financing transactions  underlying Project Alpha, and fa iled to clarify that the cash 
flow reported on its 2001 Statem   ent of Cash Fl  ows derived from  fi nancing activities, not 
operations.  See Order Instituting P roceedings Pursuant to  Section 8A of the  Securities Act of 
1933 and Section 21C of the Securities Excha nge Act of 1934, Making Findings and Imposing a 
Cease-And-Desist Order, Adm in. File 3-10897 (S ept. 24, 2002).   Dynegy further consented to 
pay a $3 million civil penalty.  SEC v. Dynegy Inc., Civil Action H-02-3623 (S.D. Tex. Sept. 30, 
2002). 

              D.      On June 11, 2003, the Commission filed a complaint against Foster in 
SEC v. Foster et al., (Civil Action H-03-2044), in the United States District Court for the 
Southern District of Texas.  The Commission’s complaint alleged that Foster willfully 
disregarded accounting advice from Dynegy’s outside auditor on Project Alpha and concealed 
critical transaction details from the auditor in violation of the federal securities laws.   

              E.      On September 7, 2007, the court entered an order perm anently enjoining 
Foster from future violations  of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b) 
and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder.

                                              IV. 

       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
accept Respondent’s Offer.  

       Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that: 

        Foster is suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant. 

 By       the Commission.
