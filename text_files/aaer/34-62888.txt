____________________________________ :       
                                                   
                                               
                                             I.  
 
       The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the 
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against David 
N. Kenneally (“Kenneally” or “Respondent”) pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(i) of the Commission’s 
Rules of Practice.1 
                    
                                               
                                             II.  
 
       In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the 
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 

                                                 
1
 Rule 102(e)(3)(i) provides, in relevant part, that: 
 
       The Commission, with due regard to the public interest and without preliminary hearing, 
may, by order, . . . suspend from appearing or practicing before it any . . . accountant . . . who has 
been by name . . . permanently enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction, by reason of his 
or her misconduct in an action brought by the Commission, from violating or aiding and abetting 
the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or of the rules and regulations 
thereunder.

Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings 
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these 
proceedings, and the findings contained in Section III.3. below, which are admitted, Respondent 
consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Rule 102(e) 
of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions 
(“Order”), as set forth below.   
 
                                              III.  
 
              On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that:  
                                               
              1.      Kenneally,                 age 47, is a resident of Rossmoor, California.  Kenneally was 
New Century Financial Corporation’s (“New Century”) controller (July 2005 to March 2007) and 
assistant controller (July 2003 to July 2005).  Kenneally is licensed as a CPA in California, but his 
license is inactive. 
 
              2.      New Century was a real estate investment trust with its principal executive 
offices in Irvine, California.  New Century’s stock was registered with the Commission pursuant to 
Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and traded on the New 
York Stock Exchange until it was delisted on March 13, 2007.  On April 2, 2007, New Century 
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.  On July 15, 2008, the bankruptcy court entered an order  
confirming a liquidation plan effective August 1, 2008, which provided for the transfer of all 
remaining assets to a liquidating trust for the benefit of unsecured creditors.  After all distributions 
have been made, the liquidating trustee will file a certificate of dissolution on behalf of New 
Century.  
 
              3.      On December 7, 2009, the Commission filed a complaint against Kenneally 
in SEC v. Morrice  , Civil Action No. CV 09-1426 DDP (FMOx), in the United States District Court  
for the Central District of California.  On August 17, 2010, a final judgment was entered by 
consent against Kenneally, permanently enjoining him from future violations of Sections 10(b) and 
13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b) and 78m(b)(5), and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 
13b2-2 thereunder, 17 C.F.R. §§ 240.10b-5, 240.13b2-1, and 240.13b2-2, and from aiding and 
abetting violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. §78m(a), and Rules 12b-20, 
13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder, 17 C.F.R. §§ 240.12b-20, 240.13a-11, and 240.13a-13. 
 
              4.      The Commission’s complaint alleges, among other things, that in the second 
and third quarters of 2006, Kenneally, contrary to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, 
implemented changes to New Century’s method for estimating its loan repurchase obligation and 
failed to ensure that New Century’s backlog of pending loan repurchase requests were properly 
accounted for, resulting in an understatement of New Century’s repurchase reserve and a material 
overstatement of New Century’s financial results.  The complaint alleges that Kenneally, by his  
conduct, violated Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 
13b2-2 thereunder, and aided and abetted New Century’s violations of Section 13(a) of the 
Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder.

                                              IV. 
                                                 
       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
impose the sanction agreed to in Respondents’ Offer.   
        
       Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that: 
         
       A.      Kenneally is suspended from appearing or  practicing before the Commission as an 
accountant.  
        
       B.     After three years from the date of this order, Respondent may request that the 
Commission consider his reinstatement by submitting an application (attention: Office of the Chief 
Accountant) to resume appearing or practicing before the Commission as: 
 
              1.      a preparer or reviewer, or a person responsible for the preparation or review, 
of any public company’s financial statements that are filed with the Commission.  Such an  
application must satisfy the Commission that  Respondent’s work in his practice before the 
Commission will be reviewed either by the independent audit committee of the public company for 
which he works or in some other acceptable manner, as long as he practices before the  
Commission in this capacity; and/or 
               
              2.      an independent accountant.  Such an application must satisfy the 
Commission that: 
 
                      (a)    Respondent, or the public accounting firm with which he is 
associated, is registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“Board”) in 
accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and such registration continues to be effective; 
                       
                      (b)    Respondent, or the registered public accounting firm with which he 
is associated, has been inspected by the Board and that inspection did not identify any criticisms of 
or potential defects in the respondent’s or the firm’s quality control system that would indicate that 
the respondent will not receive appropriate supervision; 
                       
                      (c)    Respondent has resolved all disciplinary issues with the Board, and 
has complied with all terms and conditions of any sanctions imposed by the Board (other than 
reinstatement by the Commission); and 
                       
                      (d)    Respondent acknowledges his responsibility, as long as Respondent 
appears or practices before the Commission as  an independent accountant, to comply with all 
requirements of the Commission and the Board, including, but not limited to, all requirements  
relating to registration, inspections, concurring partner reviews and quality control standards.

         C.        The Commission will consider an application by Respondent to resume appearing 
or practicing before the Commission provided that his state CPA license is current and he has  
resolved all other disciplinary issues with the applicable state boards of accountancy.  However, if  
state licensure is dependent on reinstatement by the Commission, the Commission will consider an 
application on its other merits.  The Commission’s review may include consideration of, in 
addition to the matters referenced above, any other matters relating to Respondent’s character, 
integrity, professional conduct, or qualifications to appear or practice before the Commission. 
 
 By the Commission.
