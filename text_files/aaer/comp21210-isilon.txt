21          Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission ("the Commission")  alleges: 
22                               SUMMARY      OF  THE  ACTION 
23          1.     This case involves false financial reporting by defendant Isilon Systems, Inc., a 

24   Seattle-based  data storage device company.  In December 2006, Isilon had the most 

25  successful  Initial Public Offering for a technology stock since the autumn of2000. On the 

26   first day oftrading, Isilon's  stock price rose from $13.00 to $23.10 per share, a 77 percent 

27   increase from the initial offering price.  The successful stock offering placed significant

                                                                                              th

                                                                              Telephone: (415) 705-2500

 1  pressure  on Isilon's  management,  however, to maintain the stock price gains. 

 2          2.      As  Isilon's  actual sales results  came in for the three quarters following the 

 3  Initial Public Offering, Isilon's  then Chief Financial Officer, Stuart W. Fuhlendorf 

 4  ("Fuhlendorf'),  knew that the Company would not meet the analysts'  revenue forecasts  and 

 5  that Isilon's  share price was at risk ofa significant decline.  Fuhlendorftherefore  engaged  in a 

 6  scheme to inflate Isilon's  reported revenues  in violation ofthe requirements   ofthe Company's 

 7  own accounting  policies  as well as Generally Accepted Accounting  Principles  ("GAAP"). 

 8           3.     Isilon, through Fuhlendorf,  improperly recognized  revenue on five transactions 

 9  in its first three quarters as a public company.  Isilon, on multiple occasions, booked "sales"  to 

10  resellers who did not have firm commitments  from end-users      or the ability to pay without the 

11   resale.  Isilon also improperly booked revenue   on a roundtrip transaction  where it purchased 

12  software  from a customer who used the software revenue from Isilon to "purchase"  Isilon 

13   product.  Isilon also improperly booked revenue    on a transaction where the terms were not 

14  fixed until after  the quarter ended. 

15          4.      By  improperly recognizing  revenue on these five transactions,  defendant  Isilon 

16  reported revenues  that were materially  inflated by  a total of$4.8 million over the first three 

17  quarters following  the Initial Public Offering. 

18           5.     The Commission  seeks an order enjoining Isilon from future violations     of the 

19  securities  laws. 

20                                  JURISDICTION  AND         VENUE 

21          6.      The Commission  brings this action pursuant to Section    21 (d) of the Securities 

22  Exchange Act    of 1934 ("Exchange  Act")  [15 U.S.C.   §§ 78u(d)].  This Court has jurisdiction 

23  over this action pursuant to Sections 21(e) and 27   of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C.    §§ 78u(e) 

24  and 78aa]. 

25          7.      Isilon, directly or indirectly, has made use of the means and instrumentalities 

26   ofinterstate commerce,   of the mails, orof the facilities ofa national securities exchange, in 

27  connection  with the acts, practices,  courses ofbusiness, and transactions  alleged herein.

 1          8.     This District is an appropriate venue for this action under Section 27 ofthe 

 2  Exchange Act [15 U.S.C.    § 78aa].  Certain ofthe acts, practices, courses ofbusiness, and 

 3  transactions constituting the violations alleged herein occurred within the Western District of 

 4  Washington, where the defendant is headquartered.  Assignment to the Seattle Division is 

 5  appropriate because much   of the relevant conduct took place in King County. 

 6                                       THE   DEFENDANT 

 7          9.     Isilon Systems, Inc. is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Seattle, 

 8  Washington.  The Company's  common stock is registered with the Commission under 

 9  Section 12(b)  ofthe Exchange Act [15 U.S.C.   § 78/].  Isilon sells systems for storing and 

10  managing file-based data to end-users and resellers to store electronic unstructured, file-based 

11  data such as video, audio, and digital images. 

12                                      RELEVANT       PARTY 

13          10.     Stuart W. Fuhlendorf, age 47, resides in Seattle, Washington.  At the time of 

14  the events alleged herein, Fuhlendorfwas  the CFO   of Isilon.  Fuhlendorfs  employment with 

15  Isilon terminated in October 2007.  Prior to joining Isilon in 2004, Fuhlendorf served as CFO 

16  for two companies in the technology and manufacturing sectors. 

17                                  FACTUAL  ALLEGATIONS 

18          11.     Isilon went public in December 2006 in the most successful IPO for a 

19  technology stock since autumn 2000.  On the first day  of trading, Isilon's  stock price rose 

20  from $13.00 to $23.10, a 77 percent increase from the initial offering price.  The success, 

21  however, placed significant pressure on Isilon's management at the time.  Analysts covering 

22  Isilon projected revenue for the company to grow from $21.5 million in the fourth quarter 

23  2006 to $29.9 million for the second quarter  of2007 and revenue to remain in "hyper-growth" 

24  through 2009. 

25          12.     At the time ofthe events alleged herein, Isilon's policy, as described in 

26  multiple SEC filings, was to recognize revenue on sales to end-users and resellers when it  (1) 

27  had entered into a legally binding arrangement with a customer, (2) delivery had occurred, (3) 
28  Complaint                                          3                    Securities and Exchange Commission 
    SEC  v. Isilon                                                             44 Montgomery  Street, 26th 
                                                                                                       Floor 
                                                                                     San Francisco, CA 94104 
                                                                                    Telephone:  (415) 705-2500

 1  the fee was deemed fixed or determinable and free    ofcontingencies and significant 

 2  uncertainties,  and (4) collection was probable.  With sales to resellers, Isilon had an internal 

 3  written policy that the company did not recognize revenue on sales to resellers without 

 4  persuasive evidence   of a firm arrangement with an end-user customer.  Isilon typically 

 5  accepted purchase orders from resellers and end-users   as the legally binding arrangement 

 6  outlining the terms of the sale. 

 7          13.     In response to pressure from the market to perform, Fuhlendorf fraudulently 

 8  caused Isilon to improperly recognize revenue on five transactions   in its first three quarters as 

 9  a public company, totaling $4.8 million.  Fuhlendorfknew  or was reckless in not knowing 

10  that Isilon, on multiple occasions, sold to resellers who did not have firm commitments from 

11  end-users  or the ability to pay without the resale.  He also participated in a roundtrip 

12  transaction where Isilon purchased software from a customer who used the software revenue 

13  from Isilon to purchase Isilon product.  Fuhlendorf also played a part in a sale where the terms 

14  were not fixed until after the quarter ended. 

15          A.	     Fourth  Quarter  2006:  IsUon  Improperly    Recognized  Revenue    on a $1.1 
                    Million Transaction   with an  IsHon Reseller. 
16 
            14.     For the fourth quarter of2006,  Isilon expected one of its largest resellers 
17 
    ("Reseller  1") to place a $1 million order, but as the quarter progressed, Reseller 1 advised 
18 
    Isilon that, because its end-user did not yet need the product, the order would not be 
19 
    forthcoming   in 2006. 
20
            15.     After the IPO, in mid-December 2006, Fuhlendorf and Isilon's  former CEO 
21 
    called the CEO   of Reseller 1 and asked ifReseller 1 would accept shipment   of over $1  million 
22 
    .in product before the end of the year as a "favor" to Isilon.  Fuhlendorf and Isilon's former 
23 
    CEO made this request for a favor, knowing that Reseller 1 did not have a purchase 
24 
    commitment from an end-user.  During this call, Fuhlendorf or Isilon's  former CEO told 
25
    Reseller  1's CEO that Reseller 1 would not have to pay Isilon for product until it received an 
26 
    order and payment from an end-user.

28  Complaint                                           4                    Securities and Exchange Commission 
    SEC v. Isilon                                                                                      th 
                                                                                44 Montgomery  Street, 26 Floor 
                                                                                      San Francisco, CA 94104 
                                                                                     Telephone:  (415) 705-2500 
---------------------Page 5---------------------

 1          16.     The CEO ofReseller  1 agreed to order and warehouse    $1.1 million in Isilon 

 2  product based on the assurance it would not have to pay for the product until it received an 

 3  order and payment from an end-user.  The assurance provided to Reseller 1     by Fuhlendorf or 

 4  Isilon's  fonner CEO did not appear  in the purchase order issued by Reseller 1 on December 

 5  20,2006. 

 6          17.     The purchase order from the end-user never materialized, and Reseller 1 

 7  refused to pay for the product and instead sought to return the product.  In 2008, Isilon agreed 

 8  to accept the return ofthe product, less $382,000 in product Reseller 1was able to sell to 

 9  other end-users in the third and fourth quarters of2007. 

10          18.     Despite the oral side agreement, Isilon improperly recognized $900,000 in 

11  revenue on the transaction in the fourth quarter of 2006.  On February 7,2007,  Isilon filed a 

12  current report on Fonn 8-K announcing its results for the fourth quarter and year-ended 

13  December 31, 2006.  Isilon reported revenue for the fourth quarter   of$20.7 million, $900,000 

14  of which came from the Reseller 1 transaction.  This was improper under GAAP because 

15  Isilon had no  finn commitment from Reseller 1 to pay for the product without a resale and 

16  thus the sale was not free of contingencies. 

17          19.     Isilon reported the same false and misleading financial infonnation  in its Fonn 

18   lO-K for 2006, filed with the Commission on March 15,2007. 

19          20.     Isilon knew or was reckless in not knowing that its statements in its Fonns  8-K 

20  and 10-K to  be false and misleading because Fuhlendorf, in his capacity as Isilon's  CFO, 

21  directly participated in the Reseller 1 transaction that caused Isilon to overstate its revenue for 

22  the quarter. 

23          B.	     First Quarter  2007:  IsHon Improperly  Recognized $3.1 Million      in
 
                    Revenue  on  Three  Separate  Transactions.
 
24 
            21.     The pressure that Isilon felt after the very successful IPO only increased during 
25
    its first full quarter as a public company.  There was significant pressure on Isilon to meet 
26 
    analysts'  expectations or to at least meet the projections Isilon had provided to the market.  By

 1  the end  of the first quarter the pressure  to bring in revenue hit a peak with Fuhlendorf  and 

 2  Isilon's  Vice President of Sales arranging  an 8:00 a.m. conference call with the entire sales 

 3  organization  on  Saturday, March 31, where Fuhlendorftold  the sales force to do whatever 

 4  needed to  be  done to get sales booked before the quarter-end  and in particular,  to close deals 

 5  that had previously  been categorized  as probable first-quarter  sales. 

 6          22.     In the final days of the first quarter, Fuhlendorf directly participated inthree 

 7  transactions  that accounted  for $3.1 million in reported revenue for the quarter.  Two  of the 

 8  transactions  involved  sales to resellers where Fuhlendorfknew    or was reckless in not knowing 

 9  that collection  was not reasonably  assured and the third involved a fraudulent round-trip 

10  transaction  with an end-user where collection was not assured without Isilon's  cash payment 

11   to the end-user.  As Fuhlendorfknew,  recognizing  revenue on these transactions  was 

12  improper  under GAAP. 

13                  i.  The  Undisclosed   Oral  Side Agreement    in Sale to Reseller  2 

14          23.     In the first quarter of2007,  a small reseller that serves companies  in the film 

15   industry ("Reseller  2") told Isilon that it might place an order for approximately  $500,000 

16  worth  of product before the end   of the quarter.  However, as the quarter-end  approached, 
                 I 
17  Reseller  2 declined  to place an order because it had not  received a purchase  order from its 

18  anticipated  end-user. 

19           24.     On the second-to-Iast  day ofthe  quarter, Saturday March 31, the Isilon sales 

20   representative on the Reseller 2 account scheduled  a three-way conference call among 

21   himself,  the president ofReseller 2, and Fuhlendorf.  During the call, the president  of Reseller 

22  2 informed  Fuhlendorf  that Reseller 2 did not have a purchase order from the end-user and 

23  that Reseller  2 would not  be able to pay for the product until it resold.  Fuhlendorf assured 

24  Reseller  2 that lack ofa purchase  order from the end-user  would   not be a problem and that 

25  Isilon would help Reseller  2 resell the product to another end-user   ifnecessary.  Reseller 2 

26  asked Fuhlendorf to memorialize his assurances in writing and Fuhlendorf declined. 

27          25.     Reseller 2 decided to go forward with the deal based    on Fuhlendorfs    oral 
28   Complaint                                           6                     Securities and Exchange  Commission

 1  assurances, assurances that did not appear - at Fuhlendorf s insistence - in the purchase order 

 2  issued by  Reseller 2. Reseller 2 placed an order the night of Saturday, March 31, 2007, for 

 3  $517,000'ofIsilon  product,  of which Isilon improperly recognized $453,000 in revenue for 

 4  the first quarter.  Isilon's recognition ofrevenue on the sale was in violation ofGAAP 

 5  because, as Fuhlendorfknew,  there was no firm commitment from Reseller 2 and 

 6  collectability was not reasonably assured.  Additionally, Fuhlendorfknew  that, in violation  of 

 7  GAAP, Isilon had an ongoing involvement in the transaction since Isilon sales people were 

 8  obliged to help the buyer find an end-user. 

 9          26.     Ultimately, Reseller 2's end-user did not issue a purchase order.  The product 

10  was resold  by Isilon's  sales force, working on behalfof Reseller 2, to other end-users in the 

11  fourth quarter of2007   and the first quarter of2008.  Reseller 2 did not pay Isilon for the 

12  product until it was sold through to the end-users. 

13                  ii. The  Undisclosed  Oral  Side  Agreement   in Sale to Reseller  3 

14          27.     Also during the first quarter of2007, another small reseller serving the 

15  entertainment industry ("Reseller 3") informed Isilon that it anticipated a $600,000 order from 

16  an end-user soon.  As quarter-end approached, Fuhlendorf asked the president     of Reseller 3 to 

17  take the Isilon product without a final purchase order from the end-user.  Reseller 3 advised 

18  Fuhlendorf that Reseller 3 could not pay without an end-user and Reseller 3 could not have 

19  non-payment hurt its relationship with Isilon.  Fuhlendorf responded that non-payment would 

20  not result in a credit hold and that Isilon would find another home for the product ifnecessary. 

21  None   of Fuhlendorfs  oral promises appeared   in the purchase order issued by Reseller 3. 

22          28.     With the assurances from Fuhlendorf, Reseller 3 ordered $638,000 in Isilon 

23  product on March 31, 2007,    ofwhich Isilon recognized $612,000 in revenue in the first 

24  quarter.  Isilon's  recognition ofrevenue was in violation ofGAAP    because, as Fuhlendorf 

25  knew, there was no firm commitment and collectability on the sale was not reasonably 

26  assured.  Moreover, Fuhlendorfknew  that, in violation ofGAAP,  Isilon had an ongoing 

27  involvement in the transaction since Isilon sales people were continuing to try to sell the 
28  Complaint                                           7                    Securities and Exchange Commission

 1  product. 

 2          29.    The end-user did not materialize for Reseller 3, which, per the oral side 

 3  agreement, did not pay Isilon for the product until it was sold to another end-user.  About 

 4  $200,000 in product was ultimately resold  by  Reseller 3; the remaining product was returned 

 5  to Isilon in June 2008. 

 6                 iii. The Bogus Roundtrip  Transaction 

 7          30.    In mid-February 2007, a small start-up software company ("Software 

 8  Company"), issued a purchase order to Isilon for $2.8 million in product.  The purchase order 

 9  stated it was contingent on the Software Company receiving authorization from the Italian 

10  government for use   ofits product. 

11          31.    By  late March, Fuhlendorflearned  that it was unlikely that the Italian 

12  government would authorize use    of the product before the end ofthe quarter, and thus the 

13  contingency would not be lifted - preventing revenue recognition under GAAP.      In response, 

14  Fuhlendorf called the president of the Software Company and negotiated a deal whereby the 

15  Software Company would complete its purchase ofIsilon  hardware before the end      of the first 

16  quartet and in return Isilon would purchase the Software Company's  software in the second 

17  quarter of2007.  Fuhlendorf committed Isilon to buy the Software Company's  software 

18  knowing that the product had not been tested with Isilon's hardware and knowing that neither 

19  sales nor marketing plans had been established.  Because the president  ofthe Software 

20  Company told Fuhlendorf during the call that he did not want this deal to impact the Software 

21  Company's  cash flow, Fuhlendorf structured the transaction  so that Isilon's  cash payments to 

22  the Software Company would flow back to Isilon. 

23          32.     The deal struck by Fuhlendorf and the Software Company's  president was 

24  memorialized in two separate documents dated March 30.      In one document, the Software 

25  Company agreed to immediately lift the contingency on $2.2 million    of the $2.8 million 

26  ordered in February with  $1 million due to Isilon by May 30, 2007 and the other $1.2 million 

27  due  by July 1. In the second document that was signed  by  Fuhlendorf, Isilon agreed to 
28  Complaint                                          8                   Securities  and Exchange  Commission

14  before the Software  Company was to     pay  $1.2 million  to Isilon for the Isilon product). 

15  Although  the written  agreement  signed  by  Fuhlendorf  stated that Isilon had the "option"  to 

16  order $1.0 million  in additional  Software Company product on     or before June 30, during the 

17  phone  call negotiating  the transaction,  Fuhlendorf  characterized  the additional  order to the 

18  president  of the Software Company not as an option, but as an actual commitment  to 

19  purchase.

              34.    Of  the $2.2 million sale ofproduct to the Software Company, Isilon recognized 
 11 
 12  revenue   on $2.0 million in the first quarter of2007.  Isilon's  recognition ofthe revenue  on the 

 13   transaction  with the Software Company was in violation    of GAAP because, as Fuhlendorf 

 14  knew, it was a round-trip  transaction  in which the essence  ofthe transaction  was a cITcu1ar 

 15   flow of cash and there was no economic substance to the deal.  Isilon, through Fuhlendorf, 

 16  also knew that collectability  was not assured. 

              35.     After the first quarter ended, per the agreements, Isilon paid $1.2 million to the 
 17 
 18   Software  Company and the Software Company paid        $1 million to Isilon.  Isilon, however,  did 

 19  not purchase  additional  Software Company product  as it found no business use for the 

 20   Software Company's  software and no way to sell it bundled with Isilon's  hardware.  In 

 21   response  to Isilon's  failure to place the second order, the Software Company refused to make 

 22  the second scheduled payment     of $1.2 million and instead, made a partial payment   of 

 23  approximately  $200,000 to offset the $1.2 million Isilon had paid to the Software Company 

 24   on May   22. 

              36.     On April 25, 2007, Isilon filed a Form 8-K announcing its results for the first 
 25
 26  quarter  ended April  1, 2007.  Isilon reported revenue of$21.6   million, ofwhich $3.1 million

  Software  Company.  The recognition    of the $3.1 million was improper because Fuhlendorf 

 2
  knew  oforal side agreements  with Reseller  1 and Reseller 2 and knew collectability  was not 

 3
  reasonably  assured on any  ofthe three transactions.  Isilon, through Fuhlendorf,  further knew 

 4
  that recognition ofthe revenue on the roundtrip transaction with the Software Company was 

 5  improper because  there was no economic substance to the transaction. 

 6
         37.     Isilon also reported this inflated revenue in its Form 10-Q, filed with the 

 7
  Commission  on   May  10, 2007 .. 

 8
         38.     Isilon knew  or was reckless in not knowing that its statements in its Forms 8-K

  and 10-Q to  be false and misleading because Fuhlendorf, in his capacity as Isilon's  CFO, 

10  directly participated  in the 'transactions that caused Isilon to overstate its revenue for the

13
 
            39.     In June 2007, a French video file-sharing company (the "Video Company") 
14
 
     started discussions  with Isilon about purchasing product.  By  late June, the Video Company 
15
     and Isilon had come close to finalizing a deal for the sale of$1  million in Isilon product. 
16
 
    Before the deal closed, however, the Video Company's  CFO advised an Isilon sales 
17
 
    representative  that the Video Company could not enter into the transaction until it received 
18
 
     approval  from its board.  The CFO also informed the sales representative  that the board would 
19
 
    not meet to approve the transaction  until early July, after the close ofIsilon's second quarter. 
20
            40.     Fuhlendorflearned  about the contingency in June from the sales manager.

    Despite the fact that the Video Company's  board had not yet approved the deal, Isilon shipped 
22

24
 
            41.     As  it turned out, the Video Company's  board did not approve the deal. 
25
     Instead, on or around July  3,2007,  before Isilon filed its financial statements for the second 
26
 
     quarter of 2007, the Video Company proposed different terms, nearly doubling the amount        of

 1  product Isilon would provide at no additional charge.  Isilon accepted the new terms and on 

 2  July 5, the Video Company's  CFO confirmed the new deal with the additional product        by e­

 3  mail to Fuhlendorf. 

 4          42.     On July  26,2007,  Isilon filed a Form 8-K announcing its results for the second 

 5  quarter-ended  July 1,2007.  Isilon reported revenue of$25.1  million.  This revenue included 

 6  $800,000 from the Video Company transaction.  Isilon's  recognition     of revenue for this sale 

 7  was in violation  of GAAP because, as Fuhlendorf was aware, the terms were not fixed and 

 8  determinable  at quarter-end. 

 9          43.     On August 9, 2007, Isilon filed its Form 10-Q for the second quarter reporting 

10  the same results. 

11          44.     Isilon knew the Forms 8-K and 10-Q to     be false because Fuhlendorf,  in his 

12  capacity  as Isilon's  CFO, directly participated in the transaction that caused Isilon to overstate 

13  its revenue for the quarter.

15          45.     On  October 23,2007, Fuhlendorfs   employment with Isilon terminated.  On 

16  November  8, 2007, Isilon publicly announced     thatits audit committee was conducting an 

17  independent  internal investigation. 

18          46.     On February   29,2008,  Isilon disclosed that, as a result ofthe investigation,  it 

19  would restate its financial statements in its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 

20  2006 and   in its Forms 10-Q the first and second quarters  offiscal 2007.  In the restatement, 

21  the company corrected $7.0 million    of the $67.4 million of revenue reported from the fourth 

22  quarter of2006   through the second quarter   of2007.   Ofthe  $7.0 million restated, $4.8 million 

23   derived from the improper revenue recognition on the sales described above.
