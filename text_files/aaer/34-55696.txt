       The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) deems it appropriate 
that cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C 
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), against Terry M. Phillips 
(Phillips or Respondent). 

                                           II. 

       In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted 
an Offer of Settlement (the Offer), which the Commission has determined to accept.  
Solely for the purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on 
behalf of the Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting 
or denying the findings herein, except as to the Commissions jurisdiction over him and 
the subject matter of these proceedings, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the 
entry of this Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, Making Findings, and 
Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934 (Order), as set forth below.

                                          III. 

       On the basis of this Order and Respondents Offer, the Commission finds 1
                                                                                 that: 

A. RESPONDENT            

       Phillips, 48, of Midlothian, Virginia, is the founder, 20 percent owner and 
principal operator of Capitol Distributing, L.L.C. (Capitol) and the founder and 50 
percent owner of Phillips Land Company (PLC). 

B. RELEVANT ENTITIES              

       1.     Capitol is a privately-owned video game distributor organized as a limited 
liability company under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia.  It was founded by 
Phillips in 1999.  During the relevant period, Capitol had approximately ten employees. 
 
       2. PLC     is a Virginia company 50 percent owned and principally operated by 
Phillips, has no employees and, in the ordinary course of business, has no involvement in 
the purchase, sale, or distribution of video games. 
        
       3.           Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (Take-Two) is a Delaware 
corporation headquartered in New York, New York.  Take-Two develops, markets and 
publishes interactive entertainment software games for the personal computer as well as 
video game consoles.  Since July 31, 2006, Take-Twos common stock has been 
registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and 
currently trades on the NASDAQ NMS under the symbol TTWO. 
        
C. SUMMARY           
 
       Take-Two and certain of its officers committed numerous violations of the 
anti-fraud, financial reporting and recordkeeping provisions of the federal securities laws 
to inflate reported revenue during fiscal years 2000 and 2001.2
                                                               Phillips was a cause of 
some of those violations which resulted from certain transactions between Take-Two, 
Capitol and PLC.  Specifically, in four separate transactions with Capitol during that 
period, Take-Two fraudulently recorded as sales approximately $15 million in revenue

  The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondents Offer of Settlement and are not 
binding on any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding. 
 
2
  On June 1, 2005, the Commission authorized and simultaneously settled civil actions in 
federal court against Take-Two and several present and former members of senior 
management, obtaining injunctions, disgorgement, civil penalties, and officer and 
director bars.  The Commission also authorized, and simultaneously settled, an 
administrative cease-and-desist proceeding against one officer and a Rule 102(e)(3) 
administrative proceeding against the former Chief Financial Officer. 
 

                                           2

from shipments of games to Capitol that Capitol parked and subsequently returned 
without making any effort to sell.  In two of the transactions, Capitol created invoices 
falsely describing the returns as purchases of assorted product by Take-Two from 
PLC.  In those two transactions, Take-Two also provided the funds to Capitol or PLC that 
those entities then used to cover checks they wrote to Take-Two to purportedly pay for 
the games. 
        
       Based on his participation in certain aspects of these transactions, Phillips was a 
cause of Take-Twos violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange 
Act and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13 and 13b2-1.    3
                                                                         

D. FACTS        

       1.           From October 31, 2000 through at least July 31, 2001, Capitol accepted 
several hundred thousand video games from Take-Two with the understanding that it 
would temporarily warehouse or park the games until a subsequent Take-Two 
reporting period, and then return the games to Take-Two.  Take-Two improperly 
recorded and reported approximately $15 million in revenue associated with these 
parking transactions.   

       2.           Phillips and Take-Two began discussing Capitols participation in the 
parking arrangement in July 2000.  In an e-mail dated July 25, 2000, Phillips explained to 
two Capitol employees that we can take whatever [Take-Two] needs to ship . . . [I]f it is 
a huge amount we will need to find someplace to stick it . . . but it shouldnt be a 
problem. 

       3.           In October 2000, Take-Two discussed the first parking transaction with 
Phillips.  A Take-Two representative asked Phillips if he had another company that 
Take-Two could issue a purchase order to for the games in lieu of Capitol sending the 
games back as a return.  Phillips mentioned PLC.  Phillips instructed a Capitol employee 
to work out the details with the Take-Two representative. 

              4.           On October 31, 2000, the last day of Take-Twos fiscal year, Capitol 
accepted shipment of 230,000 video games from Take-Two with the understanding that 
Capitol would park them for a short time and then return the shipment to Take-Two.  The 
games shipped to Capitol were selected by Take-Two based on Take-Twos warehouse 
inventory at the time.  Capitol had no input regarding the games it accepted.  Take-Two 
improperly recorded $5.4 million as revenue from the shipment  the most revenue from 
a single sale that Take-Two had recognized up to that time. 

                                                 
3
  Simultaneously with the issuance of this Order, Phillips, without admitting or denying 
the allegations of the complaint, has consented to a judgment in an action filed against 
Phillips and Capitol in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia 
ordering him to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $50,000. 

                                            3
---------------------Page 4---------------------

              5.          Phillips knew that Capitol made no effort to sell the games.  Instead, 
Capitol returned all 230,000 games to Take-Two over the next two reporting periods.  
When the games were returned, Capitol provided Take-Two with invoices that falsely 
described the games as purchases of assorted product from Phillips company PLC.  
Take-Two used those invoices to conceal in its books and records the fact that the 
October 31, 2000 sale had been returned in its entirety.  PLC had no employees, no 
inventory, and did not distribute video games in the ordinary course of business. 

              6.           Take-Two provided Capitol or PLC with money to make purported 
payments for the games to bolster the appearance that the shipments to Capitol were 
legitimate sales.  For example, on December 20, 2000, Take-Two wired $2,557,239 to 
PLC.  Six days later, PLC sent Take-Two a check for $2,557,137, purportedly in partial 
payment for the games associated with the October 31, 2000 transaction.  

              7.           On February 28, 2001, Capitol accepted a second shipment of 
approximately 175,000 video games from Take-Two.  Take-Two improperly recorded the 
transaction as a $4.6 million sale  second in revenue only to the October 31, 2000 
transaction in Take-Twos history up to that time.  All 175,000 games were subsequently 
returned to Take-Two with invoices that again falsely described the return as a purchase 
of assorted product from PLC.  Capitol again used funds provided by Take-Two to 
purportedly pay for the games.  Take-Two wired Capitol $4,594,100 on April 26, 2001 
and Capitol sent Take-Two a check for the same amount the next day. 

              8.           On April 27, 2001, three days before the end of Take-Twos second fiscal 
quarter, Capitol accepted approximately 55,000 games from Take-Two.  Take-Two 
recorded $1.76 million as revenue from the purported sale.  After the end of the quarter, 
Capitol returned all these games to Take-Two. 

              9.           On July 31, 2001, the last day of Take-Twos third fiscal quarter, Capitol 
accepted a shipment of more than 85,000 games from Take-Two.  Take-Two recorded 
more than $3 million as revenue from the purported sale.  After the end of the quarter, 
Capitol returned all these games to Take-Two. 

E. LEGAL ANALYSIS             

       Section 21C(a) of the Exchange Act specifies that a respondent is a cause of 
anothers violation if the respondent knew or should have known that his act or omission 
would contribute to such violation.     
        
       Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder proscribe a variety 
of fraudulent practices.  An issuer or individual may violate these provisions by either 
intentionally or recklessly making materially false or misleading statements in connection 
with the purchase or sale of securities.  Basic, Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 231-32 
(1988).  To violate Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, a 
defendant must act with scienter, Aaron v. SEC, 446 U.S. 680, 695, 701-02 (1980), which 
the Supreme Court has defined as a mental state embracing intent to deceive, 

                                            4

manipulate, or defraud.  Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185, 193 n. 12 (1976).  
Scienter of a companys management is imputed to the company.  See, e.g., SEC v. 
Manor Nursing Centers, 458 F.2d 1082, 1089-96 (2d Cir. 1972).   
        
       Take-Two violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder 
by using the transactions with Capitol to materially inflate its operating results, and by 
filing and releasing to the public periodic reports, registration statements and press 
releases that were materially false and misleading, and that misrepresented Take-Twos 
financial condition.  Based on his conduct described above, Phillips was a cause of Take-
Twos violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. 
        
       Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 
thereunder require all issuers with securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange 
Act to file annual and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q respectively.  Exchange 
Act Rule 12b-20 requires that, in addition to the information expressly required to be 
included in such reports, the issuer include such additional material information as may 
be necessary to make the required statements, in light of the circumstances under which 
they were made, not misleading.  The obligation to file these periodic reports includes the 
obligation to ensure that they are complete and accurate in all material respects.  See, e.g., 
SEC v. Savoy Indus., Inc., 587 F.2d 1149, 1165 (D.C. Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 
913 (1979).  No showing of scienter is required to establish violations of these provisions.  
Id. at 1167.  Information regarding the financial condition of a company is presumptively 
material.  SEC v. Blavin, 760 F.2d 706, 711 (6th
                                                Cir. 1985). 
        
       Take-Two violated Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 
12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder when, as a result of the parking transactions with 
Capitol described above, it filed with the Commission materially false and misleading 
annual reports on Forms 10-K for the fiscal years ending October 31, 2000 and October 
31, 2001, and quarterly reports on Forms 10-Q for the quarters ending April 30, 2001 and 
July 31, 2001, which contained inflated operating results.  Based on his conduct 
described above, Phillips was a cause of Take-Twos violations of Section 13(a) of the 
Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder. 
        
       Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act requires issuers to make and keep 
books, records, and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the issuer.  Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 
prohibits direct or indirect falsification or causing falsification of books, records, or 
accounts subject to Section 13(b)(2)(A).  No showing of scienter is required to establish 
violations of Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(A) (see SEC v. World-Wide Coin 
Investments, Ltd., 567 F. Supp. 724, 749 (N.D. Georgia 1983)) or Exchange Act Rule 
13b2-1 (see SEC v. McNulty, 137 F.3d 732, 740-41 (2d Cir. 1998)). 
 
       Take-Two failed to make and keep accurate books, records and accounts with 
respect to its transactions with Capitol.  It also used those transactions to falsify its books 
and records.  Based on his conduct described above, Phillips was a cause of Take-Twos 
violations of Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1.

              In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the 
sanctions agreed to in Respondent Phillips Offer. 
 
          Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that: 
 
                    Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Respondent Phillips shall 
          cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future 
          violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 
          and 13b2-1; and from causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 
          13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20,  
          13a-1 and 13a-13.
