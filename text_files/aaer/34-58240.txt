                                                  III. 

       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds1
                                                                                that: 

A.     RESPONDENT 

       Deutchman, of Melville, New York, is a certified public accountant licensed in New York 
since 1971 and doing business as a sole proprietorship.  Deutchman prepared and issued an audit 
report dated April 14, 2004, in connection with his audit of Cyber Grind, Inc. (“Cyber Grind”).   

B.     FACTS 

       1.     Cyber Grind, Inc. is a Nevada corporation based in Beverly Hills, California.  
Cyber Grind’s common stock does not currently trade and is registered with the Commission 
pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”).  Cyber Grind 
reported no revenues and no assets for fiscal year ended December 31, 2003.   

       2.     Cyber Grind has at all relevant times been an issuer as defined by the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Act”). 

       3.     Although Respondent was aware of the Public Company Accounting Oversight 
Board (“PCAOB”) registration requirement, at no point did Deutchman register with the PCAOB 
as a public accounting firm. 

       4.     Respondent audited Cyber Grind’s 2003 financial statements included in Cyber 
Grind’s annual report for fiscal year ended December 31, 2003 on Form 10-KSB, filed with the 
Commission on April 14, 2004. 

       5.     Respondent prepared and issued an audit report dated April 14, 2004, which was 
included in Cyber Grind’s Form 10-KSB. 

       6.     Respondent was aware of the registration requirement and the October 22, 2003 
registration deadline for registration with the Board when Deutchman issued the audit report dated 
April 14, 2004. 

C. VIO      LATIONS 

       1.     Section 4C(a) of the Exchange Act provides, in relevant part, that the Commission 
“may censure any person, or deny, temporarily or permanently, to any person the privilege of 
appearing or practicing before the Commission in any way, if that person is found by the 
Commission … (1) not to possess the requisite qualifications to represent others … or (3) to have 
willfully violated, or willfully aided and abetted the violation of, any provision of the securities 
laws or the rules and regulations issued thereunder.” 

1 
       The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondents’ Offer of Settlement and are not binding on any 
other person or entity in this or any other proceeding. 

                                               2

---------------------Page 3---------------------

        2.      Rule 102(e)(1) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice provides that the 
Commission “may censure a person or deny, temporarily or permanently, the privilege of 
appearing or practicing before it in any way to any person who is found by the Commission ... (i) 
not to possess the requisite qualifications to represent others … or (iii) to have willfully violated … 
any provision of the Federal securities laws or the rules and regulations thereunder.” 

        3.      Section 102(a) of the Act provides that “it shall be unlawful for any person that is 
not a registered public accounting firm to prepare or issue, or to participate in the preparation or 
issuance of, any audit report with respect to any issuer.” 2 

        4.      The provisions of Section 102(a) of the Act became effective on October 22, 2003.      3 

        5.      Based on the conduct described above, the Respondent willfully     4
                                                                                     violated Section 
102(a) of the Act. 

D.      FINDINGS 

        1.      Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that Respondent did not possess the 
requisite qualifications to represent others. 

        2.      Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that Respondent willfully violated 
Section 102(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 

                                                  IV. 

        In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in Respondent’s Offer. 

        Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that: 

2 
        A violation of the Act or any rule that the PCAOB issues under the Act is treated for all purposes in the 
same manner as a violation of the Exchange Act, including with respect to penalties.  Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 
15 U.S.C.A. § 7202(b)(1) (West 2002). 
3 
        Section 102(a) became effective “[b]eginning 180 days after the date of the determination of the 
Commission under Section 101(d)” of the Act that the Board was prepared to undertake its statutory responsibilities.  
The Commission made the required determination on April 25, 2003.  See Order Regarding Section 101(d) of the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Securities Act Release No. 8223, Exchange Act Release No. 47746, 2003 WL 
1956164  (Apr. 25, 2003). 
4 
        A willful violation of the securities laws means merely “‘that the person charged with the duty knows what 
he is doing.”’  Wonsover v. SEC, 205 F.3d 408, 414 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (quoting Hughes v. SEC, 174 F.2d 969, 977 
(D.C. Cir. 1949)).  There is no requirement that the actor “‘also be aware that he is violating one of the Rules or 
Acts.”’ Id. (quoting Gearhart & Otis, Inc. v. SEC, 348 F.2d 798, 803 (D.C. Cir. 1965)).

       A.     Deutchman shall cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and 
any future violations of Section 102(a) of the Act. 

       B.     Deutchman is censured. 

       C.     Deutchman may practice before the Commission as an independent accountant 
provided that: 

              1.      The public accounting firm with which he is associated is registered with 
the PCAOB in accordance with the Act, and such registration continues to be effective; and  

              2.      He has submitted to the Commission staff (Attention: Office of the Chief 
Accountant) the PCAOB’s letter notifying the public accounting firm with which he is associated 
that its registration application has been approved. 

 By       the Commission.
