Respondent.                                  AND-DESIST ORDER  AND A CIVIL 
                                             PENALTY  
 
 
 
                                                 
                                           I. 
 
       The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate that cease-
and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), against Medifast, Inc. (“Medifast,” “the Company,” or 
“Respondent”).   
                                             
                                           II. 
 
      In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the 
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings 
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over it and the subject matter of these 
proceedings, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Cease-
and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making 
Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order and a Civil Penalty (“Order”), as set forth 
below.

                                                III. 
 
                                                                                  1
        On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds  that:  
 
                                            Summary 
                                                   
        1.     In March 2010, Medifast restated its financial statements for 2006, 2007, and 2008 
(“2010 Restatement”).  The 2010 Restatement was required because Medifast had improperly 
accounted for its income tax provision for the affected years, which resulted in material 
understatements of its income tax expense and material overstatements of its net income after tax.  
Medifast’s inaccurate financial statements resulted in part from improper accounting that did not 
comply with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), and from a deficient system of 
internal controls that failed to ensure the appropriate recording and reporting of its income tax 
expense. 
        
       2.      Soon after its 2010 Restatement, Medifast engaged a new auditing firm.  During 
Medifast’s 2010 audit, this firm identified additional material errors related to Medifast’s revenue 
recognition and expense recognition accounting.  In April 2011, Medifast restated its financial 
statements for 2008 and 2009 to correct material misstatements of its revenue and expenses for 
those years (“2011 Restatement”).  These material misstatements also resulted from improper 
accounting that did not comply with GAAP, and from a deficient system of internal controls that 
failed to ensure the appropriate recording and reporting of Medifast’s revenue and expenses. 
                                                                            
       3.      Medifast’s improper accounting practices and internal controls deficiencies resulted 
in Medifast filing periodic reports with the Commission for the years 2006 through 2009 which 
materially overstated its income and understated its expenses.  As a result, Medifast violated 
Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 
thereunder.   
 
                                           Respondent 
 
       4.      Medifast, Inc. is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Owings Mills, Maryland.  
Through its operating subsidiaries, Medifast manufactures, distributes, and sells weight loss and 
other health and diet products and supplements.  Medifast’s common stock is registered with the 
Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange 
Act”) and trades on the New York Stock Exchange.   
 
 
 
 

                                                 
1
 The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent's Offer of Settlement and are not binding on any other 
person or entity in this or any other proceeding.   
                                                 2

                                                             Facts 
                                                                  
           5.        As a public company, Medifast is required to fairly, accurately, and timely report its 
 financial results and condition.  To ensure fair and accurate reports, the federal securities laws and 
 the Commission’s regulations require public companies such as Medifast to prepare and present 
 their reports and financial statements in conformity with GAAP.  Financial statements filed with 
 the Commission that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP are presumed to be misleading or 
               2
 inaccurate.       Medifast represented in its Commission filings that              its financial statements complied 
 with GAAP in all material respects.            

                                                                  
                                                 The 2010 Restatement 

                                                                  
           6.        On March 31, 2010, Medifast filed its Form 10-K for the year ended December 
31, 2009 and restated its financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007, and 
2008.  This restatement was required to correct material errors in the Company’s reported income 
tax expense that were caused by the Company’s failure to account for its income tax provision in 
conformity with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 109, Accounting for Income Taxes 
(FAS 109), and GAAP.   
                                                                  
                                                 The Accounting Standard 
  
           7.        FAS 109 establishes standards for companies to account for and report the effects 
                    3
of income taxes.        Due to differences between tax laws            and accounting standards for financial 
statements, some events are recognized for financial reporting purposes and for tax purposes in 
different years.  This can give rise to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or 
liabilities and their r  eported amounts in       financial statements.       The differences are temporary 
because the event will become taxable or deductible when the related asset is recovered or the 
related liability is settled.   These temporary differences          , or deferred taxes, are account       ed for under 
FAS 109 using an       asset and liability approach.  A deferred tax asset exists when temporary 
differences will result in deductible amounts in future years.  A deferred tax liability                    exists when 
temporary differences will result in taxable amount              s in future years.  Under FAS 109, a company 
must recognize both a current tax liability or asset for the amount of taxes payable or refundable 
for the current year, and a deferred tax liability or asset for the estimated future tax effects 
attributable to   temporary differences.

                                  Medifast’s Improper Tax Accounting  
          
         8.      Medifast’s income tax accounting for the years 2006 through 2008 did not comply 
with FAS 109 because, among other things, the Company did not calculate a deferred tax liability 
to account for certain fixed assets that were being depreciated faster for tax purposes than for 
                              4
financial statement purposes.     This failure caused Medifast’s net income to be materially 
overstated by an average of 12.4% over the three affected years:   
  
  
                  Period Ending             12/31/2006      12/31/2007   12/31/2008 
                                                                            
                  Net Income as             5,156,000       3,837,000      5,435,000 
                  originally reported: 
                  Adjustment to Tax         (583,000)       (411,000)      (601,000)  
                  Provision : 
                  Net Income Restated:      4,573,000       3,426,000      4,834,000 
                   
                  Percentage Decrease                                       
                  in Net Income due to      12.7%           12.0%          12.4%   
                  Restatement: 
          
         9.      Moreover,  Medifast’s reported income tax provision in its Form 10-Ks for the 
years 2007 and 2008 were not supported by Medifast’s internal income tax provision worksheets 
for those years.  These worksheets were used to calculate the Company’s current and deferred 
taxes at year-end for financial statement and GAAP purposes.  In 2008, the current income tax 
provision on Medifast’s internal worksheet was calculated as $2,578,107 and a total deferred tax 
asset was calculated as $1,321,072.  In its 2008 Form 10-K, Medifast instead reported a current 
income tax expense of $1,711,000 and a deferred tax expense of $704,000.  
          
         10.     In 2007, Medifast’s current tax provision was calculated on its internal worksheet 
 as $1,805,708 and a total deferred tax asset was calculated as $1,079,321.    In its Form 10-K for 
 2007, Medifast instead reported a current income tax expense of $1,233,000 and a deferred tax 
 expense of $473,000.      
          
                                                  
 4
   Medifast gave the following explanation in its Form 10-K for 2010, note 17, for the 2010 Restatement: “Due to the 
 Company’s growth in past years, major infrastructure investments were made….  For financial statement purposes, 
 these assets are depreciated over the assets [sic] useful life.  However, for tax purposes, the depreciation can be 
 accelerated which results in lower taxable income and potential tax refunds which were realized for the years in 
 which accelerated tax depreciation was elected for the Company….  The resulting timing difference should have 
 resulted in a deferred tax liability and additional income tax provision expense in the year’s [sic] restated….  The 
 Company  is  restating  for  errors  identified  in  its  deferred  tax  accounts  pertaining  to…  differences  between  the 
 income tax basis and the financial reporting basis of long-lived assets that were not reconciled to the deferred tax 
 balances….”  
  
                                                     4 
                                                      
---------------------Page 5---------------------

  
         11.     In its 2010 Restatement, Medifast acknowledged that it had a material weakness in 
 its internal controls over financial reporting because the preparation and review process for the 
 calculation of its tax provision was inadequate, which led to errors in the computation of deferred 
 tax assets, deferred tax liabilities, and the income tax provision.  Medifast’s audit firm also 
 reported that the Company had not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as 
 of December 31, 2009 because of the material weakness in its accounting for income taxes. 
 
                                       The 2011 Restatement 
 
                                                                                             5
         12.     Soon after filing its 2010 Restatement, Medifast engaged a new audit firm.      During 
 its  audit   of Medifast’s 2010 financial statements, the audit firm identified additional accounting 
 errors that required Medifast to again restate its financial statements, this time for the years 2008 
 and 2009.  These additional errors related to the Company’s use of improper accounting policies 
                                                                                                    6
 with regard to expense accrual and revenue recognition that were not in compliance with GAAP.         
 These errors caused Medifast to materially overstate its income and understate expenses for the 
 affected years.  
          
                   Medifast’s Improper Expense Accrual and Revenue Recognition 
  
         13.     In 2008 and 2009, Medifast consistently deferred recording certain expenses that 
 were charged to a credit card until the following month when the credit card payment was due, 
 rather than at the time the card purchase was made.  This deferral of expense recording was not in 
 compliance with FAS Statement No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, and resulted in certain 
 expenses being improperly recorded on a cash basis rather than an accrual basis.   
  
         14.     In 2008 and 2009, Medifast also failed to properly recognize revenue earned 
through its brick-and-mortar weight loss clinics in accordance with GAAP.  See ASC 605, Revenue 
Recognition; AICPA Accounting Research Bulletin 43; FASB Statement of Concepts No. 5, 
Recognition and Measurement in Financial Statements of Business Enterprises, Staff Accounting 
Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition.  The Company’s clinics, called Medifast Weight Control 
Centers (“MWCCs”), allow customers to pre-pay for weight loss programs that Medifast provides 
over a period of time, depending on the amount of weight to be lost.  Medifast prematurely 
recognized the revenue associated with these weight loss programs at its MWCCs at the time its 
clients paid the program fee, rather than over the period of time the revenue was earned by 
Medifast, in contravention of GAAP.     
          
         15.    Taken together, Medifast’s accounting errors with regard to expense accrual and 
revenue recognition caused Medifast’s 2008 and 2009 net income to be materially misstated.  In 
2009, Medifast improperly overstated its revenue by $169,000 and understated its expenses by 

                                                  
 5
   Medifast Form 8-K, Item 4.01, filed with the Commission on April 16, 2010.   
  
 6
   The Company also took a $496,000 write-off in 2008 and 2009 related to an intangible asset for which it had no 
 supporting documentation.   
                                                   5 
                                                     
---------------------Page 6---------------------

  
$539,000.  These errors, in combination with other adjustments, resulted in an overstatement of the 
Company’s net income by $606,000, or 5.1%.   In 2008, the Company improperly overstated its 
revenue by $143,000 and understated its expenses by $588,000.  These errors, in combination with 
other adjustments, resulted in an overstatement of the Company’s restated net income by $523,000, 
or 10.8%.      
          
         16.    Medifast filed its Form 10-K for fiscal year 2010 in April 2011.  The Form 10-K 
included the Company’s 2011 Restatement as well as the report of Medifast’s audit firm on the 
effectiveness of Medifast’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010.  In 
its report, the audit firm identified material weaknesses in that Medifast did not maintain sufficient 
in-house accounting personnel with the technical accounting knowledge, training, and expertise in 
the selection, application and implementation of GAAP in the areas of revenue recognition and 
expense accrual, among other things, and that the Company had continued ineffectiveness in its 
internal controls over its accounting for income taxes.   
          
         17.    Medifast acknowledged in its 2011 Restatement that, among other things:  i) it 
failed to do a detailed review of ending liability balances for the costs and expenses affected by the 
2011 Restatement, which resulted in certain expenses being recorded when they were paid rather 
than incurred; and ii) it had been improperly recording program fees for its MWCCs on a cash 
basis for customers who paid up-front.   
          
         18.    Medifast also acknowledged in its 2011 Restatement that it had a material 
weakness in its internal control over financial reporting that resulted in incorrect accounting 
policies with regard to its revenue recognition and expense accrual.  In addition, Medifast stated 
that a material weakness still existed in the preparation and review process for the calculation of its 
tax provision, due to the lack of internal tax expertise at the Company and the fact that the controls 
designed to remediate the weakness had not been in place for a sufficient period of time.    
  
                                             Violations 
          
         19.    Under Section 21C of the Exchange Act, the Commission may impose a cease-and-
 desist order upon any person who is violating, has violated, or is about to violate any provision of 
 the Exchange Act.   
  
         20.    Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act requires issuers that have securities registered 
 pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act to file such periodic and other reports as the 
 Commission may prescribe and in conformity with such rules as the Commission may promulgate.  
 Exchange Act Rule 13a-1 requires issuers to file annual reports with the Commission.  In addition 
 to the information expressly required to be included in such reports, Rule 12b-20 under the 
 Exchange Act requires issuers to add such further material information, if any, as may be necessary 
 to make the required statements, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not 
 misleading.  “The reporting provisions of the Exchange Act are clear and unequivocal, and they are 
 satisfied only by the filing of complete, accurate, and timely reports.”  SEC v. Savoy Industries, 

                                                  6

 587 F. 2d 1149, 1165 (D.C. Cir. 1978).  A violation of the reporting provisions is established if a 
 report is shown to contain materially false or misleading information.  SEC v. Kalvex, Inc., 425 F. 
 Supp. 310, 316 (S.D.N.Y. 1975). 
  
         21.    Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act requires public companies “to make and 
 keep books, records and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
 transactions and dispositions of the assets of the issuer.”  Section 13(b)(2)(B) requires public 
 companies “to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide 
 reasonable assurances that, among other things, transactions are recorded to permit the preparation 
 of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.   
          
         22.    By engaging in the conduct above, Medifast violated Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 
 and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder.   
          
         23.    In determining to accept the Offer, the Commission considered remedial acts 
undertaken by Medifast, including its enhancement of internal controls and retention of additional 
accounting personnel.   
          
                                                 IV. 
                                                   
        In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
 agreed to in Respondent Medifast’s Offer. 
  
        Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that: 
  
         A.     Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Respondent cease and desist from 
 committing or causing any violations and any future of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) 
 of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder.   
  
         B.     Respondent shall, within 30 days of the entry of this Order, pay a civil money 
 penalty in the amount of $200,000 to the United States Treasury.  If timely payment is not made, 
 additional interest shall accrue pursuant to 31 U.S.C. § 3717.  Payment must be made in one of the 
 following ways:   
  
         (1) Respondent may transmit payment electronically to the Commission, which will 
         provide detailed ACH transfer/Fedwire instructions upon request;  
         (2) Respondent may make direct payment from a bank account via Pay.gov through the 
         SEC website at http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ofm.htm; or  
         (3) Respondent may pay by certified check, bank cashier’s check, or United States postal 
         money order, made payable to the Securities and Exchange Commission and hand-
         delivered or mailed to:
