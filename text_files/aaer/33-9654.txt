      The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate that cease-
and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act 
of 1933 (“Securities Act”) and Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange

                                          II. 
       
      In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, each of the Respondents has

these proceedings, which are admitted, Respondents consent to the entry of this Order Instituting 
Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 
21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist 
Order (“Order”), as set forth below.   
 
                                                III. 
 
                                                                                  1
       On the basis of this Order and Respondents Offers, the Commission finds      that:    
 
                                             Summary 
 
       1.      This financial fraud involves falsification of time records and fraudulent revenue 
recognition for certain professional services at Saba Software, Inc. (“Saba” or “the Company”), a 
Silicon Valley-based enterprise software company that traded on the NASDAQ (ticker: SABA) 
until it was de-listed in April 2013 for delinquent SEC filings.  The scheme to defraud was carried 
out, over the period from Saba’s fiscal year 2008 through the second quarter of fiscal 2012, by 
professional services managers in multiple geographies directing consultants in Saba’s Indian 
subsidiary (the India Consulting Group or “ICG”) to falsify time records by either recording time 
in advance of performance of work or failing to record time for hours worked in order to achieve 
their quarterly revenue and margin targets.  
 
       2.      Although the fraud occurred throughout the global professional services 
organization, former Vice Presidents Patrick Farrell (“Farrell”) and Sajeev Menon (“Menon”) were 
the most senior individuals involved in the improper time-reporting practices during their 
respective periods of employment at Saba.  They also understood the impact that these improper 
practices had on Saba’s reporting of professional services revenue.  
 
       3.      As a result of the falsification of time records by Saba professional services 
managers, Saba reported false financial results in at least 40 filings with the Commission and 
dozens of press releases.  Over the period from October 4, 2007 through January 6, 2012, Saba 
cumulatively overstated the Company’s reported pre-tax earnings by approximately $70 million 
and made material misstatements regarding its revenue recognition practices.  As Saba announced 
on August 6, 2012 and November 5, 2012, management has determined that the Company is 
required to restate its financial statements for fiscal years 2008 through 2011, as well as the first 
two quarters of fiscal 2012.  Although Saba has not yet filed its restatement, the Company expects 
that the restatement will change the time period during which the affected revenues are recognized, 
generally shifting the timing of such revenues to later periods. 
 

                                                 
       1
         The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondents’ Offers of Settlement and are not binding 
on any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.   

        

 
                                                 2  
---------------------Page 3---------------------

       4.      In addition to the misconduct described herein and the professional services 
organization’s circumvention of the internal controls that did exist, the time-reporting misconduct 
at Saba went uncorrected and undetected for so long because Saba failed to devise and maintain 
adequate internal accounting controls over its professional services business and ICG.  Saba 
announced on January 18, 2013 that management had determined there were material weaknesses 
in its internal control over financial reporting with respect to its accounting and time-reporting 
practices over the period of the fraud. 
 
       5.      To date, Saba has not filed any required periodic reports since January 6, 2012.     
 
                                          Respondents 
                                                  
       6.      Saba Software, Inc. (“Saba” or “the Company”) is a Delaware corporation 
headquartered in Redwood Shores, California.  The software company provides cloud-based 
enterprise learning, talent management and social networking tools to businesses and large 
organizations.  At all relevant times, Saba’s common stock has been registered pursuant to 
Section 12 of the Exchange Act.  From its IPO in April 2000 until July 31, 2006, its common 
stock was registered pursuant to Section 12(g).  Thereafter, until June 2013, it was registered 
pursuant to Section 12(b).  It traded on the Nasdaq Global Market until it was suspended on 
April 9, 2013, and then it was delisted effective June 17, 2013 for failure to remain compliant 
with its SEC reporting obligations.  Upon its delisting and deregistration from Section 12(b), it 
reverted to its previous Section 12(g) registration.  Its common stock is currently registered 
pursuant to Section 12(g) and traded on the OTC Markets.  Saba has not filed any periodic 
reports since January 6, 2012, when it filed its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended November 30, 
2011.  

 
       7.      Patrick Farrell, age 55, was Saba’s Vice President of Consulting, North America 
Service Operations, from June 2006 to June 2011, when he became interim Vice President of 
Global Services.  In January 2012, Farrell resumed his responsibilities as Vice President of 
Consulting, North America until he left Saba in July 2012.   
 
       8.      Sajeev Menon, age 46, was Regional Vice President of Consulting, Western 
Region, North America from September 2009 until June 2011.  He served as Vice President of 
Consulting, North America from June 2011 until January 2012, when he resumed his Regional 
Vice President, Western Region position until he left Saba in July 2012.   
 
                                              Facts 
 
A.     Saba’s Falsification of Time Records 
        
       9.      Saba provides professional services solutions in conjunction with its product 
offerings sold to customers.  These professional services are often sold simultaneously with the 
software as part of a multiple-element arrangement.  Saba’s professional services historically has 
accounted for about one third of its approximately $120 million in yearly revenues.  Professional 
services have been delivered to customers worldwide by (1) customer-facing field consultants in 
                                                3  
---------------------Page 4---------------------

North America and Europe (“Field Consultants”) and (2) off-shore technical development services 
provided to the Field Consultants by the Company’s India Consulting Group (“ICG Consultants”).  
ICG is an organization within Saba’s Indian subsidiary designed to help the Company deliver 
professional services to its customers at a lower cost than comparable consultants in North 
America and Europe.  By 2011, ICG employed 50-60 consultants who generated approximately 
14,000 hours of billable work per quarter, which constituted about 17% of consulting revenue and 
6% of total revenue per quarter.   
 
       10.     Both Field Consultants and ICG Consultants were required to record time worked 
on customer projects in a timesheet database.  Hours input into the system by Field or ICG 
Consultants were approved on a weekly basis by project managers in North America and Europe, 
and revenue for the professional services organization was then measured based on the approved 
number of hours in the timesheet database.   
 
       11.    Saba disclosed in its public filings that it recognized revenue for both “time and 
materials” and “fixed fee” contracts as the services were performed.  This revenue recognition 
treatment was consistent with GAAP only if Saba could demonstrate that (1) its customers have 
historically paid a consistent rate for its services (measured by Vendor Specific Objective Evidence 
or “VSOE”) and (2) it could accurately estimate how many hours it took to complete projects 
(“ability to estimate”).  Therefore, Saba’s finance personnel depended on accurate time records to 
ensure that Saba recognized revenue in accordance with GAAP. 
 
       12.     From at least 2008 through the second quarter of Saba’s fiscal 2012, Saba 
professional services employees and managers engaged in two time-keeping practices that led to its 
improper revenue recognition.  First, there were multiple incidents of ICG Consultants recording 
hours and billing customers for the performance of professional services in advance of performing 
those services in order to accelerate revenue recognition and achieve the managers’ quarterly 
revenue targets (“pre-booking”).  Second, ICG and Field Consultants regularly failed to report 
professional services time worked in order to conceal budget overruns from management and 
finance, instead recording that time to non-billable project codes or not at all (“under-booking”).   
 
       13.     These improper time-keeping practices precluded the time records from serving as 
reliable evidence under GAAP to recognize revenue in the manner that Saba did.  As such, Saba 
management has concluded that Saba cannot demonstrate VSOE for the period from 2008 through 
the second quarter of fiscal 2012.  Over that period, therefore, Saba was required to recognize 
professional services revenues on a completed contract basis, which would have required it to defer 
substantially all of its professional services revenue and much of its license revenue (where 
software licenses were bundled with professional services) until the contract was completed.  
Accordingly, virtually all of Saba’s professional services revenue was misstated over the relevant 
time period.

---------------------Page 5---------------------

B.     Farrell’s and Menon’s Knowledge of, and Participation In, the False Time Reporting 
      Practices 
 
       14.     Farrell served as Vice President of Consulting, North America Service Operations 
from June 2006 to June 2011, when Menon assumed his position and he became Vice President of 
Global Services.  From September 2009 through June 2011, Menon served as Regional Vice 
President of Consulting, Western Region, North America.  From June 2011 until January 2012, 
Menon served as Vice President of Consulting, North America.  In January 2012, Menon resumed 
his Regional Vice President, Western Region position.  In their respective roles, both individuals 
were charged with ensuring that the professional services organization met the financial targets set 
by Saba’s Chief Executive Officer, Bobby Yazdani, and other senior management.   
 
       15.     Although the practices of pre-booking and under-booking were directed by and 
known to numerous individuals in the professional services organization and ICG, Farrell and 
Menon were the two most senior individuals who directed or approved these improper time-
keeping practices and understood that they would impact Saba’s reported professional services 
revenue and violate Company’s policies regarding financial reporting, including Saba’s Revenue 
Recognition Policy and Code of Business Conduct. 
 
       16.     Farrell was told that Field Consultants had requested or planned to request that ICG 
Consultants pre-book hours in order to achieve their quarterly revenue targets.  In other cases, 
where Field and ICG Consultants overran budgets provided to customers and the finance 
department, Farrell directed the Consultants to “eat” the hours or back them out of the timesheet 
database.  Despite being told by the finance department that the Company’s accountants and 
auditors needed to understand exactly how many hours were being worked and when (regardless of 
whether or not they were billed to the customer) in order to ensure that revenue was not being 
recognized too quickly, Farrell failed to advise the finance department of these practices or take 
any other remedial measures to ensure that there were no misstatements in Saba’s reported 
professional services revenue as a result of pre-booking or under-booking. 
 
       17.     In multiple instances, Menon directed consultants reporting to him to book time to 
the timesheet database at quarter-end, even though those hours would not be worked until the 
following quarter.  On numerous occasions, he also advised direct reports to fail to reflect in the 
time-keeping system non-billable hours that had been worked or was made aware of this prevalent 
practice by those reporting to him.  Although Menon was advised by the finance department on 
multiple occasions that non-billable hours needed to be visible to those responsible for preparing 
Saba’s financial statements, he never told finance, the auditors or anyone outside the professional 
services organization about the improper time-keeping practices that he directed and knew about.   
 
       18.     Farrell and Menon knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that Field and ICG 
Consultants were not accurately reporting their time.  They also knew, or were reckless in not 
knowing, that improper time-reporting would affect the way in which Saba recognized revenue.  
Both Farrell and Menon signed several certifications during the relevant period stating that they 
read and understood the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Revenue Recognition Policy, 
both of which prohibited the improper time-reporting practices.     

                                                5  
---------------------Page 6---------------------

        
       19.     During their periods of employment with Saba, Farrell and Menon each received 
bonuses based on achievement of certain revenue and margin targets that they could not have 
achieved absent the false time-reporting practices described above. 
  
C.     Scope and Impact of the Fraud  
 
       20.    Saba’s professional services revenues, gross margins and income were materially 
overstated in its periodic filings from October 4, 2007 through January 6, 2012 as a result of the 
time-reporting misconduct described above.  Those false financial results were also reported in 
Saba’s registration statements filed on Forms S-8 on December 18, 2009, October 6, 2011 and 
January 6, 2012, and Saba raised money through those offerings. 
 
       21.     The practices of pre-booking and under-booking, and the inaccuracy in Saba’s time 
records revealed by these practices, have led Saba management to conclude that it can no longer 
rely on its calculation of VSOE of fair value for professional services.  In this circumstance, ASC 
985-605 (Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements) and ASC 605-35 
(Revenue Recognition) require that the Company defer to the point where services are complete, 
rather than recognize over the period where services are performed, standalone services revenue 
and revenue on software license and cloud services agreements that contain bundled professional 
services.    Accordingly, Saba has determined and announced that it is required to restate its 
financial statements for the years 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011, and the first two quarters of 2012, 
due to its material non-compliance with GAAP.  Although Saba has not yet filed its required 
restatement, the cumulative impact of this alternative revenue recognition treatment is to defer 
recognition of approximately $70 million over the period from 2008 through the second fiscal 
quarter of 2012.   
        
       22.    The falsification of time records also concealed from Saba’s finance team and 
auditors information that rendered false and misleading the Company’s disclosures about its 
revenue recognition policies, including statements that it had established VSOE and recognized 
revenue as services were performed.  Those disclosures were made in Forms 10-Q and 10-K filed 
from October 10, 2007 through January 6, 2012. 
        
       23.    These misstatements are material.  First, based on the Company’s own estimates, 
the restated financials will reflect overstatements of gross revenue from 6% to 19% and gross 
profit from 10% to 41% for each of the fiscal years 2008 through 2011.  Second, the effect of the 
inflated revenue was that Saba met analyst expectations for EPS in certain quarters and reversed at 
least one year (2010) from a net income to a net loss for the year.   
 
D.     Saba’s Deficient Internal Controls Over ICG and Time Reporting 
 
       24.     Several Saba managers described an environment in the professional services 
organization in which senior management set aggressive revenue and margin targets.  These 
pressures were not counter-balanced by effective internal accounting controls. 
 

                                                6  
---------------------Page 7---------------------

       25.    The Company’s internal controls for ensuring the accuracy of professional services 
time-keeping were deficient.  Although there was a control that required project managers to 
approve the time records of Field Consultants and ICG Consultants, this control failed in multiple 
ways.  There was virtually no training on time entry for Consultants or their managers.  Moreover, 
managers approving time regularly rejected time entries that resulted in overruns to their project 
budget.  
 
       26.     Saba also failed to adequately address the financial reporting and internal control 
risks associated with ICG.  Almost all Saba’s professional services managers referred to ICG as a 
“black box,” reflecting the fact that the consulting managers who approved time entry for revenue 
recognition and customer billing purposes had almost no visibility into who was performing what 
work and when.  Despite this fact, there were insufficient controls in place to address the risk of 
inaccurate time reporting. 
 
       27.     Saba admitted in its January 18, 2013 Form 8-K that it had determined there were 
material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting with respect to its accounting 
and time-reporting practices.   
 
E.     Saba’s Required Restatement 
 
       28.     On August 6, 2012, Saba announced that, following an internal accounting review, 
management had determined that its annual financial results for fiscal years 2011 and 2010, as well 
as the first and second quarters of fiscal year 2012, should be restated as a result of instances of 
improper time-recording that it had identified in the Company’s professional services business.  On 
November 5, 2012, Saba announced that management had determined that the Company’s annual 
financial results for fiscal years 2009 and 2008 would also need to be restated. 
 
       29.     Although Saba has announced on multiple occasions that it would complete its 
restatement “as soon as practicable,” it has not yet filed its restatement.   
 
F.      Saba’s Filing Delinquencies 
 
        30.    Saba’s last-filed periodic report containing financial statements was its quarterly 
report on Form 10-Q dated January 6, 2012.   
 
       31.     On April 9, 2013, Saba’s shares were suspended from trading on Nasdaq.  As of 
June 30, 2014, Saba common stock traded on the OTC Markets with an average daily trading 
volume of 54,006 over the prior three months.   
        
                                            Violations 
 
       32.     Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder prohibit, in 
connection with the purchase or sale of securities, (1) employing any device, scheme or artifice to 
defraud; (2) making any material misrepresentation or omission; or (3) engaging in any transaction, 
practice, or course of business that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person.  As a result of the 

                                                 7  
---------------------Page 8---------------------

conduct described above, Saba violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 
thereunder, and Farrell and Menon each violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 
10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder. 
 
       33.     Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act prohibits the use of a device, scheme or 
artifice to defraud in the offer or sales of securities.  Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) make it 
unlawful, in the offer or sale of securities, to (1) obtain money or property by means of any 
material misrepresentation or omission or (2) engage in any transaction, practice or course of 
business that operates as a fraud or deceit upon the purchaser.  As a result of the conduct described 
above, Saba, Farrell and Menon each violated Sections 17(a)(1), 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the 
Securities Act.   
 
       34.     Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act requires issuers of securities registered pursuant 
to Section 12 of the Exchange Act to file periodic and other reports with the Commission.  With 
exceptions not applicable here, Rules 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 of the Exchange Act require each 
issuer to file annual, current, and quarterly reports respectively on the appropriate forms and within 
the period specific on the form.  Rule 12b-20 further requires that the required reports must contain 
any material information necessary to make the required statements made in the reports not 
misleading.  As a result of the conduct described above, Saba violated Section 13(a) of the 
Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder, and Farrell and Menon 
caused violation of these provisions by Saba.  
 
       35.     Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act requires issuers of securities registered 
pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act to make and keep books, records and accounts, which, 
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect their transactions and dispositions of their assets.  
As a result of the conduct described above, Saba violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act, 
and Farrell and Menon caused violation of these provisions by Saba. 
 
       36.     Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act requires issuers of securities registered 
pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act to, among other things, devise and maintain a system 
of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that transactions are 
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles.  As a result of the conduct described above, Saba violated Section 
13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Farrell and Menon caused violation of these provisions by 
Saba. 
 
       37.     Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act prohibits any person from knowingly 
circumventing or knowingly failing to implement a system of internal accounting controls or 
knowingly falsifying books, records, or accounts described in Section 13(b)(2) of the Exchange 
Act.  As a result of the conduct described above, Farrell and Menon each violated Section 13(b)(5) 
of the Exchange Act. 
 
       38.     Rule 13b2-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act prohibits any person from 
directly or indirectly falsifying any books and records subject to Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the 

                                                 8  
---------------------Page 9---------------------

Exchange Act.  As a result of the conduct described above, Farrell and Menon each violated 
Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1. 
 
                                         Undertakings 
 
       Respondent Saba has undertaken to:
