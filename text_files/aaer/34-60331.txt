       The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems            it appropriate and in the  
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against Thomas 
Stiner (“Stiner” or “Respondent”) pursuant to   Rule 102(e)(3)(i) of the  Commission’s Rules of 
Practice.1 
            
                                                       
                                                     II.

 Rule 102(e)(3)(i) provides, in relevant part, that: 
 
       The Commission, with due regard to the public  interest and without preliminary hearing,

       In anticipation of the institution of these  proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the “Offer”) whic h the Commission has determined   to accept.  Solely for the 
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the            
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings   
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisd  iction over him and the subject matter of these    
proceedings, and the findings contained in Section III.3.  below, which are admitted, Respondent  
consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Rule 102(e) 
of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Maki  ng Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions        
(“Order”), as set forth below.   
 
                                                 III.  
 
       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that:  
 
              1.      Stiner, age 53,              is a certified public accountant who was previously licensed 
to practice in the Comm onwealth of Pennsylvania.  He serv  ed as Chief Fina ncial Officer of 
AstroPower, Inc. (“AstroPower”) from December 1997 until his re  signation on May 23, 2003.  He  
had previously served as AstroPower’s controller from May 1993 through November 1997.   
        
              2.      AstroPower was, at all relevant times, a Delaware co    rporation with its 
principal place of business in Newark, Delaware.  AstroPower was engaged in the business of    
manufacturing solar electric power products including solar cells, modules and panels worldwide.   
At all relevant times, AstroPower’s common stock was registered with the Commission pursuant to 
Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), and traded on the         
NASDAQ National Market. 
 
              3.      On March 10, 2009, the Commission  filed a complaint against Stiner in 
SEC v. Allen Barnett, et al. (Civil Action No. 1:09-cv-00457-EGS).  On July 10, 2009, the court 
entered a final judgment  permanently enjoining Stiner, by consent, from future violations of 
Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1 
and 13b2-2, and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of  
the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, and 13a-13.  Stiner was also ordered to pay a    
$40,000 civil money penalty and prohibited from serv  ing as an officer or director of a public    
company.  
 
              4.     In its complaint, the   Commission alleged that during 2002, Stiner, and 
AstroPower’s former Chief Executive Officer,      Allen Barnett, made material misstatements, 
engaged in fraudulent accounting practices, and signed filings made with the Commission that they  
knew, or were reckless in not knowing, contai    ned materially false and misleading financial   
statements.  As alleged in the complaint, at the direction of Barnett and Stiner, and in contravention 
of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, AstroPower improperly recognized approximately  
$4 million in revenues from four transactions ex ecuted over the course of  the second and third 
quarters of 2002.  These improper accounting practices included: 1) revenue recognition from sales 
where payment of the sales price was contingent  and collectibility was not assured; 2) recognizing 

                                                  2

revenue from a fictitious sale;  and 3) initiating and recognizi ng revenue from improper seller-
initiated bill-and-hold transactions in which AstroPower bore the risks of  ownership and the costs 
of storage.  In its complaint,  the Commission alleged that as  a result of fraudulently recognizing 
revenue from these transactions, AstroPower’s reported revenues were overstated by $2.1 million 
or 12% in the second quarter of 2002, and by $1.9            million or 9% in the third quarter of 2002.    
AstroPower’s net income was also overstated  by approximately $160,000 or 80% for the second 
quarter of 2002, and approximately $440,000 or 113% fo                r the third quarter of 2002.  In its       
complaint,  the Commission also alleged that, in  connection with a single improper transaction,  
Stiner made materially false statements to AstroPower’s external auditors during the 2002 financial  
statement audit.    
    
                                                         IV. 
                                                            
        In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
impose the sanction agreed to in Respondent Stiner’s Offer. 
 
        Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that Stiner is suspended from 
appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant.   
 
 By the Commission.
