                        v.  
  
NIC INC., JEFFERY S. FRASER,                             
HARRY H. HERINGTON, and ERIC J. BUR, 
  
                                  Defendants.  
  
 
                                      COMPLAINT 

              Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) alleges as follows: 

                                       SUMMARY 

       1.     Defendant Jeffery S. Fraser, former Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and 

Chairman of the Board of Directors of NIC Inc. (NIC), concealed from investors that he 

received more than $1.18 million in perquisites from NIC from at least 2002 to 2007.  

Defendants NIC and Fraser failed to disclose Frasers perquisites and falsely represented in 

proxy statements, annual reports, and registration statements that until 2005, Fraser worked 

virtually for free.  In NICs 2006 and 2007 public filings, NIC and Fraser continued to materially 

understate Frasers perquisites.   

       2.     NICs related party transaction disclosures for 2002 through 2005 also were 

misleading.  NIC disclosed it paid over $1.3 million to rent private planes from Frasers entity 

but failed to disclose it paid an additional $1 million to other people and entities to fly and 

operate the planes for Fraser.

       3.     Frasers undisclosed perquisites included over $4,000 per month to live in a ski 

lodge in Wyoming; monthly cash payments to Fraser for purported rent for a Kansas house 

owned by an entity Fraser set up and controlled; vacations for Fraser, his girlfriend, and his 

family; Frasers flight training, hunting, spa, skiing, and health club expenses; computers and 

electronics for Fraser and his family; a leased Lexus SUV; costs for Fraser to commute by 

private aircraft from his home in Wyoming to his office at NICs Kansas headquarters; and other 

day-to-day living expenses such as groceries, liquor, tobacco, nutritional supplements, and 

clothing.   

       4.     For most of the period, Fraser did not have a personal credit card and routinely 

charged day-to-day living expenses on NIC credit cards.  In order to have NIC pay for these 

personal expenses, Fraser submitted expense vouchers that falsely claimed personal items were 

business related.  Fraser disregarded NICs policies requiring him to ensure full disclosure in 

Commission filings and to achieve responsible use of and control over assets.  Fraser did not 

provide documentation of business purpose for any of his expenses before mid-2006, failed to 

keep accurate records of funds spent, used NIC credit cards for non-business purposes, and failed 

to disclose his perquisites in NICs Commission filings.   

       5.     Defendant Eric J. Bur, NICs former Chief Financial Officer (CFO), had 

responsibility, along with NICs Chief Accounting Officer (CAO), for NICs internal controls, 

books and records, and disclosure of executive compensation in public filings.  Bur aided and 

abetted NIC in its reporting, proxy, internal controls, and books and records violations.  Bur 

permitted NIC to pay the expenses Fraser submitted on his expense vouchers even though Bur 

was informed that Fraser was not submitting receipts or documentation supporting a business 

purpose for his expenses as required by NICs policies.  Also, NICs Assistant Controller raised 

                                               2

concerns to Bur that some of Frasers expenses were not business related.  Bur was aware of the 

Commissions rules requiring the disclosure of perquisites in proxy statements and annual 

reports, yet he reviewed, signed, and/or certified NICs filings with the Commission that failed to 

disclose Frasers perquisites.  

       6.     Defendant Harry H. Herington was NICs Chief Operating Officer (COO) and 

later NICs President and Director.  Herington aided and abetted NIC in its reporting and proxy 

violations.  From at least 2004, Herington received information showing that NIC was paying for 

some of Frasers personal expenses.  Nevertheless, Herington reviewed and/or signed NICs 

filings with the Commission that failed to disclose Frasers perquisites.  Herington was informed 

of problems with Frasers expense reporting and failed to adequately address them.  In addition, 

from May 2006 through July 2007, Herington failed to apply NICs policies prohibiting personal 

charges on the NIC credit card when he approved Frasers expense reports.   

       7.     By June 2007, a whistleblower had complained to NIC and the company learned 

of the Commissions investigation, yet NIC failed to fully remedy the problems involving 

Frasers expenses.  At that point, NICs Audit Committee conducted an internal review led by 

outside counsel (the Internal Review).  Even after the Internal Review, the majority of Frasers 

perquisites were not repaid or disclosed.         

       8.     Outside counsel for the Internal Review was retained to determine whether Fraser 

misclassified personal expenses as business expenses, and if so, whether he had acted 

intentionally.  In January 2008, the Internal Review concluded Fraser had intentionally 

misclassified his expenses.  NIC, however, failed to disclose that finding when it announced the 

results of its Internal Review in a Form 8-K filed in February 2008, and when it recommended 

                                               3

that investors re-elect Fraser to NICs Board of Directors in its proxy statement filed in April 

2008.    

       9.     By engaging in the conduct described in this Complaint, NIC violated the 

antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) 

[15 U.S.C. §§ 77q(a)(2) and (3)], the proxy provisions of Section 14(a) of the Securities

§§ 78m(b)(2)(A), 78m(b)(2)(B)].    

       10.    By engaging in the conduct described in this Complaint, Fraser violated the 

antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)], Section 10(b) of 

the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)], and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5 [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5];

and the proxy provisions of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78n(a)] and 

Exchange Act Rules 14a-3 and 14a-9 [17 C.F.R. §§ 240.14a-3 and 240.14a-9]; and aided and 

abetted NICs violations of the reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of 

Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) [15 U.S.C. §§ 78m(a), 78m(b)(2)(A), and

       11.    By engaging in the conduct described in this Complaint, Herington violated the 

antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77q(a)(2)

records provision of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 [17 C.F.R. § 240.13b2-1]; and aided and abetted 

NICs violations of the reporting, books and records, internal controls, and proxy provisions of 

Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 14(a) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78m(a),

14a-9 [17 C.F.R. §§ 240.12b-20, 240.13a-1, 240.14a-3, and 240.14a-9]. 

       13.    The Commission seeks an order enjoining NIC, Fraser, Herington, and Bur from 

future violations of the above provisions, requiring them to pay appropriate civil money 

penalties, requiring Fraser to disgorge his ill-gotten gains, imposing an officer and director bar 

on Fraser, and ordering NIC to undertake specific remedial relief.  

                               JURISDICTION AND VENUE 

       14.    The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 22(a) of the 

Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v(a)] and Sections 21(d), 21(e), and 27 of the Exchange Act

       15.    In connection with the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business 

alleged in this Complaint, certain of which occurred in the District of Kansas, defendants NIC, 

Fraser, Herington, and Bur directly or indirectly, used the means or instrumentalities of interstate 

commerce, or of the mails, or the facilities of a national securities exchange. 

       16.    Venue is proper in this district pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act and 

Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77v(a) and 78aa].  

                                       DEFENDANTS 

       17.    NIC, Inc., a Delaware corporation based in Olathe, Kansas, develops and 

manages web sites, online services, and secure payment processing systems for state, local, and 

federal government agencies.  At all relevant times, NICs common stock was registered under 

Section 12 of the Exchange Act.  NICs common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select 

Market under the symbol EGOV.   

       18.    Jeffery S. Fraser, age 51, a resident of Teton Village, Wyoming, is one of NICs 

founders.  He was CEO of NIC and its predecessor Kansas Information Consortium, Inc. from 

January 1992 to November 1999.  He later served as NICs CEO from May 2002 until February 

2008.  Fraser was Chairman of the Board of Directors (Board) from the Companys formation 

until May 2008, and a Board member until September 2009.  Fraser was a member of NICs 

disclosure committee.  

       19.    Harry H. Herington, age 50, is a resident of Lawrence, Kansas.  Herington 

joined NIC in 1995, and has held a variety of titles with increasing responsibility including 

Executive Vice President of Portal Operations from January 1999 to April 2002, Chief Operating 

Officer from mid-2002 to May 2006, President from May 2006 to February 2008, a Board

member beginning in October 2006, CEO since February 2008, and Chairman of the Board since 

May 2008.  As COO and later President, Herington was responsible for NICs day-to-day 

business operations and was a member of NICs disclosure committee. 

       20.    Eric J. Bur, age 49, is a resident of Mission Hills, Kansas.  He was CFO of NIC 

from April 2001 to June 2007, and a member of NICs disclosure committee.  Bur reported to 

Herington.  From approximately 1984 through 1995, Bur worked as an auditor for two large 

accounting firms.  He had been licensed as a CPA in North Carolina starting in 1987, until that 

license was forfeited in 1988.  He was also licensed to practice as a CPA in Missouri starting in 

1988, and in Kansas starting in 1994, but these licenses lapsed.  Burs certificate status in Kansas 

is currently active.     

                                           FACTS 

NIC and Fraser Failed to Disclose Over $1.18 Million of Compensation to Fraser  

       21.    In the early 1990s, Fraser co-founded NIC and was its CEO and Chairman of the 

Board (Chairman).  He retired as CEO in 1999, but continued to serve as Chairman.  In 2002, 

when NIC was on the verge of bankruptcy, Fraser returned as CEO at the request of the Board 

and agreed to take $1 in salary.   

       22.    In NICs proxy statements and annual reports for 2002 through 2005, NIC and 

Fraser represented that Frasers compensation was nominal ($1 in 2002 and 2003; $5,500 in 

2004 and 2005), but failed to disclose to investors that NIC actually compensated Fraser for 

personal expenses.  NICs proxy statements and annual reports for 2006 and 2007 also materially 

understated Frasers perquisites although they disclosed Fraser was receiving more than nominal 

compensation.   

       23.    NIC and Fraser underreported Frasers compensation in proxy statements and 

annual reports filed with the Commission for 2002 through 2007 by a total of more than       

                                              7

$1.18 million.  This conduct violated Commission rules requiring public companies to disclose 

in these filings the compensation, including perquisites, of the principal executive officer. 

NICs Misleading Related Party Transaction Disclosures 

       24.     NICs related party transaction disclosures in its proxy statements and annual 

reports on Form 10-K for 2002 through 2005 were misleading.  These disclosures stated that NIC 

rented aircraft on an hourly basis from a company owned by Fraser and another director (the 

Related Party), and that the rental payments approximated arms-length transactions (in the 

annual report for 2002), approximated comparable rentals (in the proxy statement for 2002), or 

were reasonable compared to similar services proved by third parties (in the proxy statements 

and annual reports for 2003 through 2005).  In fact, the total amount NIC paid for Fraser to fly 

on his own planes in each of these years was significantly greater than services offered by third 

parties. 

       25.     Specifically, NIC failed to disclose that it:  (i) had compared the Related Partys 

rates, which did not include operating costs, to rates offered by third parties that included 

operating costs, and (ii) had paid more than $1 million to other people and entities to operate the 

planes for Fraser, as summarized below. 

   Year           Disclosed Rental Rates Undisclosed Operating Costs         

   2002        $260,000    $101,390 

   2003        $565,000    $410,500  

   2004        $399,000    $559,200  

   2005        $114,000                                                    $114,000  

Approximately $265,000 of the undisclosed operating costs was for Frasers personal private 

aircraft travel, which NIC also failed to disclose as a perk.

NICs Internal Policies and Controls 

       26.    NICs Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (Code of Ethics) was posted on 

NICs website and referenced in NICs proxy statements.  Among other things, the Code of 

Ethics required all employees to use corporate credit cards solely for business purposes and to 

keep accurate records of funds spent.  It also required the CEO, CFO, and CAO to:  (i) ensure 

full disclosure in filings with the Commission, (ii) achieve responsible use of and control over 

assets, (iii) establish disclosure controls to ensure that material information is included in reports 

and public communications, (iv) bring to the attention of the Audit Committee violations of the 

Code of Ethics and weaknesses or concerns about internal controls, and (v) confirm that NICs 

independent auditors are aware of material misstatements or omissions in NICs draft reports.    

       27.    NICs policies required all employees to maintain proper documentation of 

business purpose for expenses over $10. 

       28.    Fraser, Herington, and Bur were aware of the Code of Ethics and NICs policies 

requiring documentation for business expenses. 

Frasers Improper Expense Reporting   

       29.    Fraser ignored NICs policies and controls by, for example: 

              a.     Charging day-to-day living expenses to NICs credit cards for most of the 

                      relevant period;  

              b.      Seeking reimbursement for certain expenses he had not incurred;   

              c.     Treating his personal expenses as business expenses in order to get 

                      reimbursed; and   

                                               9

              d.      Prior to mid-2006, not providing receipts or other documentation 

                      supporting a business purpose for thousands of expenses that NIC 

                      processed and paid on his behalf.   

       30.    During the relevant period, NIC paid Frasers credit card charges that included 

personal expenditures.  By at least 2002, Fraser began creating, signing, and submitting monthly 

expense vouchers that only identified some of his personal credit card charges, and failed to 

identify many personal charges.   

       31.    Of the credit card charges Fraser identified as personal, he repaid some, but 

avoided reimbursing NIC for others, by offsetting them against purported out-of-pocket 

expenses.  For example, in October 2003, Fraser purchased a trampoline and motor sports 

equipment for himself totaling $1,987.67, but avoided repaying NIC for these personal items by 

off-setting them against purported out-of-pocket expenses that totaled the exact same amount.   

       32.    In addition, Fraser had NIC make payments directly to certain vendors for 

personal services, such as utilities for his home and lawn maintenance.   

       33.    Frasers expenses were mischaracterized as business expenses in NICs books and 

records, including expense vouchers, NICs general ledger, and internal financial statements for 

NICs executive department, when those expenses should have been recorded, characterized, 

classified, and disclosed as executive compensation.   

       34.    Fraser also completed, signed, and submitted director and officer questionnaires 

in which he failed to fully disclose his perquisites.  For example, in the director and officer 

questionnaire for 2004, when Fraser was asked whether he received any perquisites in 2004, he 

answered No, even though the question listed specific types of perquisites Fraser had received 

including housing and other living expenses, and personal travel expenses.

Burs Violations Began in 2002 

       35.    Beginning in mid-2002, NICs Assistant Controller told Bur that Fraser did not 

submit receipts or other documentation supporting a business purpose for his expenses, as was 

required by NICs policies and internal controls.  Nevertheless, Bur permitted NIC to pay 

Frasers expenses, which caused NICs books, records and accounts to falsely characterize 

Frasers perquisites as business expenses.   

       36.    By at least August 2003, Bur received documents showing that Fraser was 

charging some personal expenses to his NIC corporate credit card.  In August 2003, NICs 

Assistant Controller emailed Bur an analysis of Frasers credit card expenses for January 2003 

through June 2003, and a detailed list of all of Frasers credit card charges including personal 

items such as a gun vault, toys, and ski lift tickets.   

       37.    In September 2003, Bur asked NICs Assistant Controller to update the 

companys analysis of Frasers expenses through August 2003.  NICs Assistant Controller 

provided Bur with an updated analysis and detailed list of charges that included personal items 

such as vitamin supplements and gym membership fees.   

       38.    In October 2003, NICs Assistant Controller emailed Bur another updated list and 

analysis of Frasers expenses, which showed that Frasers undocumented credit card charges for 

the first eight months of 2003 were over $140,000 and that Fraser had not reimbursed NIC for a 

number of expenses that appeared on their face to be personal.  The Assistant Controller warned 

Bur that [a] number of these credit card and other expenses would completely flame employees, 

our customers, the board, and investors if they were aware.  Hopefully, none of this is selected 

for audit and I wont have to explain the business purpose for these items.  The Assistant 

                                              11

Controller suggested NIC eliminate the personal credit card expenses and instead give Fraser 

pay for performance.  Bur received a second copy of this email in January 2004.   

       39.    Bur did not adequately address NICs Assistant Controllers concerns and 

suggestions, and continued to permit NICs payment of Frasers credit card and other expenses 

without documentation of business purpose.  Bur also failed to ensure Frasers perquisites were 

disclosed in NICs public filings. 

       40.    In a January 2004 email, NICs Assistant Controller informed Bur that the 

amounts NIC was paying for Frasers private jet travel from his Wyoming home to his Kansas 

office may be considered commuting and if so, NIC could not treat these as business expenses.  

Also in the email, the Assistant Controller told Bur that he did not have enough information to 

determine where Frasers main place of work was and in order to treat these expenses as business 

expenses under IRS rules, NIC would need to perform an analysis of Frasers business activity 

for one year.  This analysis was never performed, Bur continued to have NIC account for 

Frasers commuting costs as business expenses, and NIC failed to disclose them as perquisites. 

       41.    In a June 2004 email exchange, Bur expressed concerns to NICs CAO after 

reviewing some of Frasers expense vouchers. 

       42.    By failing to adhere to NICs policies and controls, including his specific 

obligations under NICs Code of Ethics, Bur assisted NICs internal controls violations.  

       43.    Bur also knew all of Frasers credit card expenses were characterized as business 

expenses in NICs books, records, and accounts, even though Bur knew that Fraser would later 

identify and repay some of these expenses as personal.

Heringtons Violations Began in at Least 2004 

       44.    Beginning in at least 2004, Herington received information showing that NIC was 

paying certain personal expenses for Fraser.  For example, by at least June 2004, Herington 

received spreadsheets generated from the general ledger and some of Frasers expense vouchers, 

both of which contained detailed lists of Frasers expenses that included personal items such as 

charges for hair salons, sporting goods, clothing, and rifles. 

       45.    Additionally, Herington was informed that NIC was paying for Frasers home in 

Wyoming.  In November 2004, Herington received an email from another NIC executive asking 

whether NIC would be renewing the lease on Frasers condo in Teton Village, Wyoming, saying: 

This is the condo Jeff is living in that we have been paying for.  NIC extended the lease and 

continued paying for Frasers home in Wyoming on a monthly basis through April 2005. 

       46.    In July 2005, Herington received a list of Frasers May 2005 credit card expenses 

because the finance department questioned whether they were business related.  The list included 

charges for furniture and other household items, tanning salon services, airplane pilot lessons, 

and a wilderness vacation.  Although Herington inquired about a couple of the items, he failed to 

take meaningful action.   

       47.    Herington also knew NIC was leasing a luxury car for Fraser.  In October 2005, 

Herington attended a meeting at which NICs Compensation Committee approved leasing a 

Lexus SUV for Fraser to use in Wyoming. 

       48.    Notwithstanding the information Herington received about NIC paying for certain 

of Frasers personal expenses, Herington reviewed and/or signed NICs filings that failed to 

disclose Frasers perquisites.

The Defendants Violations Continued After the Commission Proposed New Executive 
Compensation Rules in 2006  
 
       49.    In a February 2006 email, Bur sent Herington and other NIC executives an article 

about the Commissions proposed rules to expand the disclosure of executive compensation.   

       50.    In April 2006, NICs Assistant Controller warned Herington by email about the 

risk of possible income tax fraud charges against Fraser and NIC because Fraser had not 

submitted any documentation of business purpose for his corporate credit card charges.   

       51.    On May 1, 2006, Bur sent an email to Herington noting that there was a great 

concern within the accounting department regarding [Frasers] expense reports and that 

someone may whistle blow this situation.  Burs serious concerns about the magnitude and 

severity of Frasers expense reporting failures included that: 

              a.     Fraser had not submitted any receipts or indicated the business purpose of 

                      any of his expenses for 2005 and the first quarter of 2006, and there were 

                      over 1,200 charges in that time period which would require a receipt under 

                      NICs policies; 

              b.      Fraser charged over $26,000 at three different home/furniture stores and 

                      there were NUMEROUS other examples of suspicious expenses;  

              c.     Fraser usually charged a flat dollar amount each month for out-of-pocket 

                      charges without any receipts or explanation;  

              d.      A portion of Frasers aircraft related expenses were personal;  

              e.     NIC paid personal expenses for Fraser: (i) without approval of NICs 

                      Compensation and/or Audit Committees; (ii) without taking into account 

                      the tax consequences to Fraser or NIC; and (iii) without NIC reporting 

                      these expenses as perquisites;  

                                              14

              f.      NIC had not disclosed any of Frasers perquisites in NICs 2005 proxy 

                      statement; 

              g.      There was a risk of Commission enforcement action based on NICs 

                      deficient internal controls over perquisites, noting that in 2005, the 

                      Commission brought an enforcement action against Tyson Foods because 

                      their system of internal controls did not report all of the perks to the Comp 

                      Committee and attached two law firm alerts: (i) important lessons from 

                      the Tyson Foods action regarding the disclosure of perquisites; and 

                      (ii) guidance on perquisites and personal benefits;     

              h.      Employees feel that [Fraser] appears to be ripping off the company and is 

                      not required to follow the same rules that everyone else (including the 

                      execs) has to follow;  

              i.      There was a strong sentiment that the previous escalation of these matters 

                      through the normal chain of command has not been effective; 

              j.      This was not a going forward only matter - the 2005 expenses need[ed] to 

                      be dealt with; and 

              k.      NICs Board and Compensation Committee would be making decisions 

                      without full disclosure from management, particularly in view of the 

                      obligations [the CFO has] with the SEC and under [NICs] CEO/Senior 

                      Financial Officer Code of Ethics.  

       52.     The Board was not informed of the specific issues raised by NICs Assistant 

Controller and Bur in their emails.   

                                              15

       53.    In mid-2006, NIC adopted additional procedures regarding executive expense 

reporting, but those procedures were not sufficient to remedy the problems and Fraser continued 

receiving undisclosed perquisites. 

       54.    At a Board meeting on May 2, 2006, Herington and Fraser announced to the 

Board new measures for Herington and Fraser to review each others expense reports and for the 

Board to receive summaries of their expenses each quarter.   

       55.    Despite Heringtons added responsibility of reviewing Frasers expense reports 

from May 2006 through July 2007, Herington failed to apply NICs policies prohibiting all NIC 

employees from making personal charges on NICs credit cards and approved Frasers monthly 

expense vouchers that contained charges for spa treatments and other personal items.  This 

resulted in NIC paying for certain of Frasers personal expenses, which were not disclosed as 

compensation to Fraser. 

       56.    In addition, on August 4, 2006, NICs Compensation Committee directed that to 

the extent Frasers 2006 expenses lacked documentation of business purpose and/or failed to 

comply with NICs expense reimbursement policy, the expenses would be treated as 

compensation to Fraser.   

       57.    In late August 2006, NICs General Counsel sent an email to Herington 

reiterating that Frasers lack of documentationdenies the company the ability to defend itself 

against any assertions that the amounts charged are perks or additional compensation to Fraser 

and the manner in which these affairs of the company have been allowed to be conducted 

indicate at the least a potential failure of, or absence of, effective internal controls, which may 

render the companys financials incapable of certification by our outside auditors, or cause 

damaging public disclosures, or both.

       58.    Notwithstanding the Compensation Committees directive that all undocumented 

expenses be treated as compensation to Fraser, Bur, Herington, and other NIC executives 

allowed Fraser to create documentation after the fact for his 2006 expenses.  In addition, to avoid 

having certain 2006 personal expenses treated as compensation, Fraser repaid NIC $110,000, but 

contemporaneously requested and received a $110,000 bonus from NIC.   

       59.    In an August 2006 email, NICs Assistant Controller told Bur that the amounts 

NIC had been paying to Fraser each month for the house in Kansas were not a business expense 

and Fraser owned the house.  Although NICs proxy statement for 2006 reported the payments 

for the house as a perquisite, Bur failed to ensure that Frasers ownership interest was disclosed.   

       60.    Additionally, during Frasers review of his 2006 expenses, Herington, Bur, and 

other NIC executives decided it was not worth the effort to have Fraser review and repay any 

expenses from previous periods even though they had been informed that Fraser had not been 

submitting documentation of business purpose since at least 2002, and the amounts of Frasers 

improper personal expenses were likely comparable each year. 

       61.    In a September 22, 2006 email, NICs Assistant Controller expressed concerns to 

Bur regarding Frasers past expenses and stated, [A]s a management team it appears that were 

going to whitewash the historical issue.   

       62.    Fraser, Herington, and Bur failed to inform NICs independent auditors of 

Frasers expense reporting problems. 

NICs False and Misleading Proxy Statements, Annual Reports, and Registration 
Statements  
 
       63.    NICs proxy statements for 2002 through 2007 were materially false and 

misleading.  Among other things, Fraser received a total of more than $1.18 million of 

perquisites that were not disclosed in these filings.   

                                              17

     Case 2:11-cv-02016-EFM -JPO   Document 1    Filed 01/12/11   Page 18 of 31

       64.    NICs proxy statements for 2002 through 2005:  (i) misrepresented Fraser was 

receiving a nominal salary, when Fraser was in fact receiving substantial undisclosed 

compensation; and (ii) made misleading related party transactions disclosures. 

       65.    In proxy statements for 2003 and thereafter, NIC referred to its Code of Ethics 

(which applied to all NIC employees, including NICs CEO, CFO, and CAO), as a means to 

promote shareholder confidence in NIC and its management.  NIC failed to disclose that:  

(i) Fraser was not complying with NICs Code of Ethics as he used corporate credit cards for 

personal expenses, failed to document the business purpose for his expenses, failed to keep 

accurate records of funds spent, mischaracterized personal expenses as business expenses, and 

failed to disclose his perquisites in Commission filings; and (ii) Bur and the CAO were not 

complying with NICs Code of Ethics because, for example, they failed to ensure that Frasers 

perquisites were disclosed in Commission filings, failed to achieve responsible use and control of 

NICs assets within their purview, and failed to maintain controls over Frasers expenses. 

       66.    NICs proxy statement for 2006 disclosed as a perquisite that NIC paid monthly 

rent and utilities for a leased house in Kansas for Fraser to use during his time spent at the 

companys corporate headquarters in Olathe, Kansas.   However, the proxy statement failed to 

disclose that the house was owned by an entity Fraser set up and controlled. 

       67.     NICs proxy statement for 2007 recommended that investors re-elect Fraser to 

the Board, stating that NICs policies require all directors to possess high personal and 

professional ethics, integrity, and values, and purported to disclose the results of the Audit 

Committees Internal Review of Frasers expenses, but failed to disclose that the Internal Review 

concluded Fraser intentionally misclassified his expenses.  

                                               18

       68.    NICs materially false and misleading proxy statements were incorporated into: 

(i) NICs annual reports on Forms 10-K for 2002 through 2007; (ii) NICs Form S-8/A filed on 

May 10, 2004; (iii) NICs Form S-3 filed on October 14, 2005; (iv) NICs Form S-8 filed on July 

25, 2006; and (v) NICs two Forms S-8 filed on November 20, 2006.  Accordingly, these annual 

reports and registration statements were materially false and misleading. 

       69.    Fraser directly solicited proxies in connection with NICs proxy statements for 

2002 through 2007, when he knew or was reckless in not knowing they were materially false and 

misleading.   

       70.    Fraser signed NICs annual reports on Forms 10-K for 2002 through 2007, when 

he knew or was reckless in not knowing they were materially false and misleading.  Fraser also 

certified these annual reports, even though those filings materially understated his compensation, 

NICs disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective with respect to Frasers expense 

reporting and NICs reporting of Frasers compensation, and he had failed to disclose to NICs 

independent auditors his fraudulent conduct.  

       71.    Fraser also signed registration statements filed by NIC in 2004, 2005, and 2006, 

when he knew or was reckless in not knowing they incorporated false and misleading proxy 

statements and annual reports for those years. 

       72.    Bur, as CFO and a member of NICs disclosure committee, reviewed NICs proxy 

statements and participated in the preparation of the executive compensation disclosures in those 

proxy statements that failed to disclose Frasers perquisites and contained false statements 

concerning Frasers compensation, even though Bur received information showing that NIC was 

paying for certain of Frasers personal expenses.  Bur also signed the 2002 through 2006 annual 

reports on Form 10-K that incorporated the false and misleading proxy statements.  Accordingly, 

                                              19

     Case 2:11-cv-02016-EFM -JPO   Document 1    Filed 01/12/11   Page 20 of 31

Bur knowingly or recklessly provided substantial assistance to NIC in its filing of materially 

false and misleading proxy statements and annual reports. 

       73.    Bur certified the 2002 through 2006 annual reports.  Bur made these certifications 

even though these reports materially understated Frasers compensation and NICs disclosure 

controls and procedures were ineffective with respect to Frasers expense reporting and NICs 

reporting of Frasers compensation. 

       74.    Herington, as a member of NICs disclosure committee, reviewed all of NICs 

public filings and, as President, signed the annual report for 2006.  Herington received 

information showing that NIC was paying for certain of Frasers personal expenses yet those 

perquisites were not disclosed in NICs filings with the Commission.  Accordingly, Herington 

knowingly or recklessly provided substantial assistance to NICs filing of materially false and 

misleading proxy statements and annual reports from 2004 through 2006.  

       75.    Herington also signed NICs November 20, 2006, registration statements when he 

knew or should have known that they incorporated NICs 2005 proxy statement and annual 

report, which misrepresented that Fraser received nominal compensation and failed to disclose 

any perquisites for Fraser. 

Misrepresentations to NICs Independent Auditors 

       76.    Fraser signed all of NICs management representation letters to NICs 

independent auditors in connection with their annual audits of NICs financial statements for 

2002 through 2006, and their reviews in connection with the registration statements NIC filed in 

2004 through 2006.  In the letters, Fraser made the following misrepresentations:  (i) that he had 

no knowledge of any fraud or suspected fraud involving senior management; and (ii) that he had 

                                              20

     Case 2:11-cv-02016-EFM -JPO   Document 1    Filed 01/12/11   Page 21 of 31

disclosed all deficiencies in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting, 

whether or not remediated. 

NIC Failed to Correct Frasers Expense Reporting Problems Even After Learning of the 
Commission Staffs Investigation in 2007 
 
       77.    NIC failed to correct Frasers expense reporting problems even after learning of 

the staffs investigation in 2007. 

       78.    In mid-2007, an NIC employee complained internally about, among other things, 

improper expense reporting by executives.  NIC failed to adequately address this complaint.  

After NIC learned of the Commissions investigation, the Audit Committee conducted the 

Internal Review of Frasers 2004 to 2007 expenses.  However, the Internal Review was not 

thorough, and the majority of Frasers perquisites still have not been repaid or disclosed.   

       79.    In mid-2009, the Audit Committee retained outside counsel to review Frasers 

1999 through 2003 expenses, and that review is still ongoing.   

NICs Materially False and Misleading Form 8-K Filed in 2008 

       80.    Outside counsel for the Internal Review was specifically retained to determine 

Frasers intent.  In January 2008, the Internal Review concluded that Frasers misconduct was 

intentional.  Shortly thereafter, Fraser resigned as CEO, but remained Chairman of the Board.   

       81.      NIC filed a Form 8-K after the market closed on February 6, 2008, announcing 

Frasers retirement as CEO.  In the Form 8-K, NIC disclosed that Fraser had reimbursed NIC 

$283,000 for expenses that Fraser or the Internal Review determined were not consistent with the 

companys expense reimbursement policy.  The Form 8-K was misleading because it purported 

to disclose the results of the Internal Review but failed to disclose the Internal Reviews 

conclusion that Fraser intentionally misclassified his expenses.
