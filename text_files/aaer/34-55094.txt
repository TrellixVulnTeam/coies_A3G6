______________________________: 

                                             I. 

       The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate to issue 
an order of forthwith suspension of Charles R. Eisenstein (“Eisenstein”), pursuant to Rule 
102(e)(2) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R.  200.102(e)(2)].1 
                                                         §

                                             II. 

       The Commission finds that:  

       1.     Eisenstein, age 56 of Brooklyn, New York, is not, nor has he ever been at any time 
   relevant to this proceeding, a certified public accountant (“CPA”) licensed to practice in any 
   jurisdiction or before the Commission.2 

       2.     On August 12, 2002, Eisenstein pled guilty to one count of securities fraud in 

1 
       Rule 102(e)(2) provides in pertinent part:  Any . . . person who has been convicted of a felony or a 
misdemeanor involving moral turpitude shall be forthwith suspended from appearing or practicing before the 
Commission.” 
2      In an audit report filed with a Form 8-K with the Commission, Eisenstein falsely represented that he was a 
CPA and that he had audited the financial statements of the public company.
