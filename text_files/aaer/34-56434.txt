ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING 
File No. 3-12795 

IN THE MATTER OF SCHUHALTER, COUGHLIN & SUOZZO PC, AND EDWARD 
J. SUOZZO, CPA 

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced the 
issuance of an Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Section 4C of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice 
(Order) against Schuhalter, Coughlin & Suozzo PC (Schuhalter PC) and Edward J. 
Suozzo, CPA (Suozzo). 

The Order alleges that Schuhalter PC prepared and issued and Suozzo participated in the 
preparation and issuance of an audit report on the financial statements of a public company 
in 2003, without first registering with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
(Board).  Section 102(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley Act) 
prohibits accounting firms not registered with the Board from preparing or issuing audit 
reports with respect to any issuer after October 22, 2003.  The Order alleges that, by this 
conduct, Schuhalter PC and Suozzo lacked the requisite qualifications to represent others 
and that Schuhalter PC willfully violated Section 102(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. 

Based on the above, the Order institutes proceedings against Schuhalter PC and Suozzo 
pursuant to Section 4C(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and 
Rule 102(e)(1)(i) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, and additionally as to Schuhalter 
PC, Section 4C(a)(3) of the Exchange Act and Rule 102(e)(1)(iii) of the Commission’s 
Rules of Practice, to determine whether the allegations in the Order are true, and whether 
they should be censured or temporarily or permanently denied the privilege of appearing or 
practicing before the Commission as an accountant. 

A hearing will be scheduled before an administrative law judge to determine whether the 
allegations in the Order are true, to provide Schuhalter PC and Suozzo an opportunity to 
dispute these allegations, and to determine what sanctions, if any, are appropriate.  The 
Order directs the Administrative Law Judge to issue an initial decision in this matter no later 
than 300 days from the date of service of the Order.
