16 
    DIANE BJORKSTROM, 
17 
           Defendant. 
18 

19         Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") alleges: 

20                                 SUMMARY      OF THE   ACTION 

21         1. This matter involves misconduct on the part of Diane Bjorkstrom ("Bjorkstrom" or 

22  "Defendant"),  who served as the Chief Financial Officer of Tvia, Inc. ("Tvia" or "the Company") 

23  from September 2004 to October 2006.  Bjorkstrom's  wrongdoing fell into two areas. 

24         2. First, Bjorkstrom caused Tvia to improperly recognize revenue from a $325,000 delayed 

25  delivery sale that Tvia shipped at 10:00 p.m. on the last day of Tvia's 2006 fiscal year, causing Tvia 

26  to materially overstate its reported revenue for that year.  The sale, which shipped despite the fact that 

27  the customer had not agreed to accept delivery until 6-10 weeks after year-end, went to a third-party 

28  warehouse, and the product sat unused for months.  The recognition of this revenue violated 
           COMPLAINT
 
           SEC V. BJORKSTROM
 
---------------------Page 2---------------------

  1 
      Generally  Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP")  and Tvia's  revenue recognition policy, since 
 2 
      the sale never occurred in accordance with the buyer's  delivery instructions and therefore should not 
 3 
      have been recognized as revenue during the fiscal 2006 period. 
 4 
             3.  Second, Bjorkstrom failed to stand up to efforts by Benjamin Silva, III ("Silva"), then 
 5
     Tvia's  Vice President of Worldwide Sales, who manipulated Tvia's  internal accounting records by 
 6 
     applying  funds from one customer to aged receivables    of another.  On at least two occasions, 
 7 
     Bjorkstrom  did not challenge Silva's  dubious explanations when he asked Bjorkstrom and others in 
 8 
     Tvia's  finance department to apply incoming funds from one customer to improperly pay down a 
 9 
     separate customer's  aged receivables.  These actions (and inactions) caused Tvia's  artificially­
10
     decreased  receivables to be concealed from Tvia's  outside auditors. 
11 
             4.  As a result, Tvia materially overstated its revenue for its 2006 year-end results (March 31, 
12 
     2006) and its first quarter offiscal 2007 (ended June 30, 2006), and the press releases announcing 
13 
     those results (May 26, 2006 and August 7, 2006). 
14 
                                        JURISDICTION        AND VENUE 
15
             5.  The Commission  brings this action pursuant   to Sections 20(b) and 20(d)  ofthe Securities 
16 
     Act  of 1933 ("Securities Act")  [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b) and 77t(d)] and Sections 21(d) and  21 (e) ofthe 
17 
     Securities  Exchange Act  of 1934 ("Exchange  Act") [15 U.S.C.    §§ 78u(d) and 78u(e)]. 
18 
             6.  This Court has jurisdiction  over this action pursuant to Sections 20(c) and 22(a) ofthe 
19 
     Securities Act [15 U.S.C.  §§ 77t(c) and 77v(a)] and Section 27   ofthe Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 
20
     78aa].  The defendant, directly or indirectly, has made use  of the means and instrumentalities of  . 
21 
     interstate  commerce, of the mails, or of the facilities ofa national securities exchange in connection 
22 
     with the acts, practices and courses of business alleged in this complaint. 
23 
             7.  Venue is proper in this District pursuant to Section 22 of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 
24 
     77v], and Section 27  of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa].  Bjorkstrom resides within the 
25
     Northern  District ofCalifornia, and acts or transactions  constituting violations occurred within this  .

                                      INTRADISTRICT        ASSIGNMENT 
 2 
             8.  Assignment  to the San Jose Division is appropriate pursuant to Civil Local Rules 3-2(c) 
 3 
     and 3-2(d) because acts and omissions giving rise to the Commission's  claims occurred, among other 
 4 
     places in this district, in Santa Clara County.

                                                 DEFENDANT 
 6 
             9.  Diane Bjorkstrom,  age 54, resides in Palo Alto, California.  From September 2004 through 
 7 
     October 2006, Bjorkstrom  served as Tvia's  Chief Financial Officer ("CFO").  Prior to joining Tvia, 
 8 
     Bjorkstrom  served as CFO and interim CFO    of various high-tech companies.  Bjorkstrom holds an 
 9 
     inactive license from the state of Pennsylvania to practice as a Certified Public Accountant. 
10
                                            RELEVANT       ENTITY 
11 
             10. Tvia is a semiconductor  company based in Santa Clara, California.  During the time 
12 
     period of the wrongful conduct alleged in this Complaint, Tvia's  common stock traded   on the 
13 
     NASDAQ  Global Market ("NASDAQ")  under the symbol "TVIA,"  and the Company was registered 
14 
     with the Commission  pursuant to Section 12(g)  of the Exchange  Act.  Tvia's  fiscal year-end is March 
15
     31.  On January  30, 2007, Tvia issued a press release indicating that the market should not rely on 
16 
     any financial  statements,  earnings  press releases, and similar communications  issued by Tvia for its 
17 
     2006 and 2007 fiscal years.  On July 12,2007,  NASDAQ  delisted the Company's  securities due to 
18 
     lack of compliance  With listing requirements.  On October  15, 2008, Tvia filed a voluntary petition 
19 
     for reorganization  under Chapter 11 ofthe United States Bankruptcy  Code.  In April 2009, the 
20
     bankruptcy  court approved  the appointment  ofa Chapter  11 trustee.

23 
             11. Tvia designs and develops digital display processors  for use in LCD and other high­
24 
     definition  TVs.  Tvia sells their products into multiple  channels, including to original equipment 
25
     manufacturers,  distributors,  and end-users.  For Tvia's  2005 fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, before 
26 
     the conduct  at issue, the company  posted $3.3 million in revenue. 
27 
             12. At the time ofthe conduct at issue, it was improper under GAAP and   Tvia's revenue

  1 
      recognition  policy to recognize  revenue  on a transaction  in which the customer did not want 
 2 
      immediate  delivery of the product  nor the financial obligation  to pay Tvia until several quarters in the 
  3 
      future.  These unusual terms  would preclude immediate  revenue  recognition. 
 4 
                                Bjorkstrom  Caused Tvia To Recognize Revenue 
 5
                            From Year-End  Sale Without Proper Purchase Order 
 6 
             13. During  the relevant  time period, the bulk ofTvia's shipping typically occurred at quarter­
 7 
     and year-end  from  Tvia's facility  in Hefei,  China.  Bjorkstrom  routinely  traveled to China at these 
 8 
     times to oversee  all shipments.  Bjorkstrom  went to China at each quarter-end  to ensure Tvia's 
 9 
     policies  and procedures  would  be followed,  and that the company  would receive the appropriate 
10
     documentation  from customers  before the company  would ship product  and recognize revenue from a 
11 
     sale.  One of the pieces of documentation  required before shipping  product was a customer  purchase 
12 
     order with delivery  terms for the shipment. 
13 
             14. On  or about  March  31, 2006, Tvia received  a written  purchase  order for $325,000 in 
14 
     product  from MicroNetwork  Korea  ("MNK"),  a customer  based in South Korea.  According  to the 
15
     purchase  order, MNK   promised  to pay Tvia in full within 90 days  ofshipment  and requested  delivery 
16 
     in 6-10 weeks.   On or about  10:00 p.m. on  March 31, Bjorkstrom  approved  shipping   MNK's   product 
17 
     to a Hong Kong warehouse  operated     by a third-party  logistics  company,  where the product sat unused 
18 
     for months.  The Company  recognized  $325,000  in revenue    on this sale  for the fourth quarter of 
19 
     Tvia's 2006 fiscal year, which  ended March  31, 2006. 
20
             15. It was improper  for Tvia to immediately  recognize  revenue on this sale  because Tvia did 
21 
     not have a customer  purchase  order requesting  prompt  delivery of the product.  Bjorkstrom  approved 
22 
     the recognition of revenue  from the sale despite the lack ofthis documentation.  Bjorkstrom  should 
23 
     have known that the recorded  sale did not occur in accordance  with the  buyer's delivery  instructions 
24 
     (i.e., 6 to 10 weeks)  and therefore  should not have been recognized  as revenue.  As a result of 
25
     Bjorkstrom's  actions,  Tvia overstated  its revenue  for the quarter  ended March 31, 2006 by $325,000, 
26 
     or approximately  13%.

---------------------Page 5---------------------

  1 
                     Bjorkstrom  Failed To Investigate Unidentified  Customer Payments 
 2 
              16. On more than  one occasion,  Silva; Tvia's  then-VP of Worldwide  Sales, asked Bjorkstrom 
 3 
     and others  in Tvia's  finance  department  to apply incoming funds from one customer to improperly 
 4 
     pay  down a separate customer's  aged receivables.  By failing to question  the explanations  given by 
 5
     Silva for these cash applications,  Bjorkstrom  allowed Tvia to decrease  its receivables  and thus 
 6 
     concealed  potential  revenue  recognition  problems. 
 7 
             17. In late 2005, Silva  learned that Tvia's auditors were scrutinizing  several instances in 
 8 
     which  customers  were delinquent  in their payments to the Company.  The auditors  were considering 
 9 
    . whether  to require Tvia to reverse some or all of the revenue it had previously  recognized  relating to 
10
     these  delinquent  accounts, on the ground that it was no longer reasonable  to believe that the revenue 
11 
     was collectible. 
12 
             18. In order to mislead Tvia's  auditors,  and avoid the reversal ofrevenue, on at least two 
13 
     occasions  Silva caused  Tvia to misapply  a payment  it received from a new  customer  in order to pay 
14 
     down   delinquent  amounts  owed  by a separate  customer. 
15
             19. The first instance  concerns  Ricom, a Chinese customer  which by late 2005 was past due 
16 
     on Tvia invoices totaling  more  than $740,000.  In February 2006, Silva convinced  another customer, 
17 
     Protech  Perennial  Limited  ("Protech"),  to submit a $100,000 deposit  for a then-unavailable  line of 
18 
     Tvia  chips.  On or about February  24,2006,   Tvia received a wire transfer from Protech for $100,000. 
19 
             20. In order to convince  Bjorkstrom  to apply these funds to Ricom's  account,  Silva falsely 
20
     claimed  that Protech had wired the money    on Ricom's  behalf, due to purported  Chinese government 
21 
     restrictions  on Ricom's wiring  money out  ofthat  country.  Bjorkstrom  did not question  Silva's 
22 
     explanation  or obtain customer  confirmation,  despite knowing  that Ricom typically  wired payments 
23 
     through  its Hong Kong subsidiary,  which was not constrained    by Chinese  currency  restrictions.  The 
24 
     unusual  arrangement  outlined  by Silva should have raised red flags that Bjorkstrom  should have 
25
     investigated. 
26 
             21. The second instance  concerns  EUT and MPEG, two Chinese  customers  that owed 
27 
     significant  past due amounts  to Tvia.  In June 2006, Silva convinced  another  customer,  Datavision

             SEC V. BJORKSTROM 
---------------------Page 6---------------------

  1 
      (also known as Data International),  a customer located in Taiwan, to submit a $200,000 deposit 
 2 
     against  an expected future order of Tvia product.  On or about June 29, 2006, Tvia received a wire 
 3 
     transfer  from Datavision for $200,000. 
 4 
             22. In order to convince Bjorkstrom  to apply these funds to the accounts ofEUT   and MPEG, 
 5
     Silva falsely claimed to Bjorkstrom that Datavision had wired the money on    EUT's   and MPEG's 
 6 
     behalf, due to purported Chinese government restrictions on Datavision's  wiring money out    of that 
 7 
     country.  Again, Bjorkstrom did not question the large $200,000 cash paYment or obtain customer 
 8 
     confirmation,  even though there were discrepancies  that should have prompted her to investigate. 
 9 
     For example,  Silva repeatedly changed how the Taiwanese company's  wire transfer should be 
10
     allocated  to the two other customers,  and at times he mistakenly allocated over $200,000 in total to 
11 
     the two accounts.  In addition, the purported  payments from EUT and MPEG did not appear to 
12 
     correspond  to how  much either customer  actually owed Tvia, as Silva directed that the payment be 
13 
     applied  first to the smaller receivable,  with the remainder to be applied to the other customer's 
14 
     account. 
15
             23. If, as Silva claimed, the two customers used the Taiwanese customer as a third party 
16 
     wiring service, Bjorkstrom should have expected that the customers (and thus Silva, who was 
17 
     relaying  their information) would have known precisely how much each customer was wiring and 
18 
     thus how  much to apply to each account.  Moreo,":er, it was at the very least coincidental that the 
19 
     individual  payments  by the two customers,  which were combined into one wire transfer from Taiwan, 
20
     totaled  exactly $200,000.00.  Given Tvia's  limited business  volume, these issues should have 
21 
     prompted  additional  questions or follow-up  from Bjorkstrom. 
22 
             24. Bjorkstrom's  failure to investigate  despite the red flags raised by Silva's  explanations 
23 
     caused Tvia to materially misstate  its 2006 year-end and first quarter of fiscal 2007 results.

  1 
             26. By engaging in the conduct described above, Bjorkstrom, directly or indirectly, in the 
 2 
      offer or sale of securities, by use of the means or instruments of transportation or communication in 
 3 
      interstate commerce or by use  of the mails: 
 4 
                      (a)    obtained money or property by means    of untrue statements of material fact 
 5 
                             or by omitting to state a material fact necessary in order to make the 
 6

                            or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the purchasers. 
10 
             27. By reason  of the foregoing, Bjorkstrom violated, and unless restrained and enjoined, will 
11 
     continue to violate Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.c. § 77q(a)(2) and (3)].

15 
             28.     The Commission realleges and incorporates by this reference Paragraphs  1 through 24, 
16 
     above. 
17 
             29.  Based on the conduct alleged above, Tvia filed with the Commission current, quarterly, 
18 
     and annual reports on Forms 8-K, 10-Q, and 10-K that contained untrue statements      of material fact 
19 
     and omitted to state material information required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make 
20           , 
     the required  statements, in the light of the circumstances  under which they were made, not
