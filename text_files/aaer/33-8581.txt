______________________________ :   

                                          I. 

       The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate 
that cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 8A of 
the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) and Section 21C of the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) against Robert M. Blau (“Blau” or “Respondent”). 

                                         II.  

       In anticipation of the institution of this proceeding, Respondent has submitted an 
Offer of Settlement (the “Offer”) that the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely 
for the purpose of this proceeding and any other proceeding brought by or on behalf of  
the Commission or in which the Commission is a party, and prior to a hearing pursuant to 
the Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.100 et seq., Respondent, without 
admitting or denying the findings contained herein, except that Respondent admits to the 
jurisdiction of the Commission over him and over the subject matter of this proceeding, 
consents to the issuance of this Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, Making 
Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist-Order Pursuant to Section 8A of the 
---------------------Page 2---------------------

Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(“Order”). 

                                          III. 

       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds  1
                                                                                 that: 

A. RESPONDENT            

       Robert M. Blau, 50, of Long Beach, New York, has been Vice President of Sales 
at Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (“Take-Two” or the “Company”) since July 1998, 
and held that position during the relevant period. 

B. RELEVANT ENTITY              

       Take-Two is a Delaware corporation headquartered in New York, New York.  
Take-Two develops, markets and publishes interactive entertainment software games for 
the personal computer as well as video game consoles.  Take-Two’s common stock is 
registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and is 
currently listed on NASDAQ under the symbol “TTWO.”  For its fiscal year ended 
October 31, 2003, Take-Two reported over $1 billion in revenue. 

C. SUMMARY           

       This proceeding against Blau arises from his participation in a financial and 
accounting fraud by Take-Two.  Take-Two inflated its revenues during its 2000 and 2001 
fiscal years through fraudulent sales and improper accounting practices, including 
numerous “parking” transactions in which the Company shipped several hundred 
thousand video games to different distributors at or near the end of a fiscal quarter or 
fiscal year, fraudulently recorded revenue from the shipments as if they were sales, and 
then accepted returns of the shipments in subsequent reporting periods.  Some of the 
returns associated with this practice were not accounted for by the Company as returns in 
the later reporting period (i.e., they were not netted against sales).  Instead, these returns 
were disguised as the purchase of new inventory.  Take-Two used these artifices to 
materially inflate its reported revenues and profits.  The parking transactions allowed 
Take-Two to consistently meet or exceed analysts’ predictions regarding its earnings per 
share during all four quarters of fiscal year 2000. 

       Take-Two’s parking transactions were largely orchestrated by the Company’s 
Chief Operating Officer (“COO”) but Blau, at the COO’s direction, arranged several of 

                                                 
1
  The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent’s Offer of Settlement and are not 
binding on any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.   

                                           2

the parking transactions and created the necessary paperwork to disguise the returns as 
purchases of new inventory. 2 
                              

       Through the fraudulent transactions that Blau participated in, Take-Two was able 
to materially overstate its reported revenue and/or earnings on two annual and five 
quarterly reports filed with the Commission in fiscal years 2000 and 2001.  In February 
2002, Take-Two restated its financial statements for its fiscal year ended October 31, 
2000 and the first three quarters of its fiscal year 2001 to correct for the parking 
transactions that the Company had used to inflate its revenues.3 
                                                                

       As a result of the conduct described above and detailed below, Blau violated 
Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and 
Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1.  Blau also caused violations of Sections 13(a), 
13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 13a-1, 13a-13, 
12b-20 and 13b2-2. 4 
                     

D. FACTS        

       From 2000 through July 31, 2001 Take-Two engaged in parking transactions with 
video game distributors Capitol Distributing (“Capitol”), Corner Distributors (“Corner”), 
SJS Group LTD (“SJS”), About Time Distributors (“About Time”), and Pioneer 
Distributors (“Pioneer”).  These parking transactions resulted in Take-Two’s recognition 
of approximately $60 million of fraudulent revenue. 
        
       Take-Two conducted the largest parking transactions with Capitol.  On October 
31, 2000, Take-Two’s fiscal year end, Take-Two shipped 230,000 video games to Capitol 
with the understanding that the entire shipment would be returned.  Take-Two improperly 
recorded $5.4 million as revenue from the shipment – which at that time was Take-Two’s 
largest sale ever.  In subsequent reporting periods, Capitol returned the entire shipment, 

                                                 
2
  Simultaneously with the issuance of this Order, the Commission filed a settled civil 
action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against 
Take-Two’s COO, Larry Muller, for his role in the Company’s fraud. 
 
3
  In February 2004, Take-Two again restated its financial statements, this time to correct 
for its failure to set aside reserves for future price concessions during fiscal year 2000  
through the end of the third quarter of fiscal year 2003.  The Company’s February 2004 
restatement also corrected for the improper accounting treatment of approximately 88 
additional sales transactions during 2000 and 2001 that had inflated its revenues. 
 
4
  Simultaneously with the issuance of this Order, the Commission filed a settled civil 
complaint against Blau in the United States District Court for the Southern District of 
New York.  Blau has consented to a judgment in that action (which alleges that he 
violated Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act) ordering him to:  (a) pay disgorgement in 
the amount of $52,653, plus prejudgment interest thereon and (b) pay a civil penalty in 
the amount of $50,000.

and the Company arranged for the return to be made through an affiliate of Capitol.  
Take-Two disguised the return as a purchase of “assorted product” from that Capitol 
affiliate with an invoice that made no reference to specific titles or descriptions of the 
product. 
 
       Blau, at the direction of the Company’s COO, contacted Capitol’s owner/operator 
to arrange the parking transactions and to arrange for the returns to be made through a 
Capitol affiliate.  Blau actually approved the returns and utilized fraudulent “assorted 
product” invoices and purchase orders to disguise the returns as purchases of new 
inventory. 
 
       On February 23, 2001, the COO emailed Blau that, in order to “spike” the 
business before the end of the month, a substantial order had to ship to Capitol in the next 
three days.  Five days later, on February 28, 2001, Take-Two shipped approximately 
175,000 video games to Capitol and improperly recorded $4.6 million in revenue – Take-
Two’s second largest sale at that time.  The entire shipment was subsequently returned.  
Again, in an effort to conceal the fact that the original shipment was not an actual sale, 
Blau arranged for the return to be made through the same Capitol affiliate and utilized an 
invoice that made no reference to specific titles or descriptions to disguise the return as a 
purchase of “assorted product.” 
 
       In all, Take-Two executed approximately $15 million of parking transactions with 
Capitol.  Take-Two executed similar parking transactions with other distributors as 
follows:  (1) eleven transactions with Corner for over $10 million; (2) ten transactions 
with SJS for over seven million dollars; (3) nine transactions with About Time for nearly 
seven million dollars; and (4) fourteen transactions with Pioneer for over five million 
dollars.  In these transactions, similar to the Capitol transactions, Blau arranged the 
shipments, approved the returns and utilized misleading “assorted product” invoices and 
purchase orders to disguise the returns as purchases of new inventory.5 
                                                                        

E. LEGAL ANALYSIS             

       Section 17(a) of the Securities Act prohibits a person, in connection with the offer 
or sale of a security, from making untrue statements of a material fact or omitting to state 
a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances 
under which they were made, not misleading.  To violate Section 17(a)(1) of the 
Securities Act, a party must act with scienter, Aaron v. SEC, 446 U.S. 680, 695, 701-02 
(1980), which the Supreme Court has defined as “a mental state embracing intent to 
deceive, manipulate, or defraud.”  Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185, 193 n. 12 
(1976).  Blau violated Section 17(a) by participating and acquiescing in sales transactions 
with knowledge or reckless disregard of their fraudulent nature from at least 2000 
through most of 2001.  These transactions resulted in fraudulent recognition of millions  

                                                 
5
  Blau received emails discussing returns from Pioneer between 2000 and 2001, 
including one referring to video games as “Take 2’s parked goods.”

of dollars of revenue from the false characterization of parking and returns as purported 
sales of nearly $60 million worth of video games, and material misrepresentation of the 
Company’s financial position to investors. 
 
       Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder proscribe 
fraudulent practices in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.  An issuer or 
individual violates these provisions by intentionally or recklessly making material 
misstatements or omissions in Commission filings which may be relied upon by investors 
in purchasing the issuer’s securities.  Basic, Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 231-32 
(1988).  To violate Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, a party must act with scienter.  See 
Aaron, 446 U.S. 680.  Blau violated Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 by his knowing or 
reckless participation in fraudulent sales and parking transactions, which permitted Take-
Two to materially misrepresent its financial position to investors. 
        
       Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) prohibits knowing falsification of corporate 
books, records, or accounts and circumvention of internal controls.  Exchange Act Rule 
13b2-1 prohibits direct or indirect falsification or causing falsification of books, records, 
or accounts subject to Section 13(b)(2)(A).  Blau violated Section 13(b)(5) and Rule 
13b2-1 by knowingly employing fraudulent purchase orders to disguise returns as 
purchases of new inventory, resulting in falsification of Take-Two’s books, records and 
accounts subject to Section 13(b)(2)(A). 
 
       Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 
thereunder require all issuers with securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange 
Act to file annual and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q respectively.  Rule 12b-
20 requires that, in addition to the information expressly required to be included in such 
reports, the issuer must include such additional material information as may be necessary 
to make the required statements, in light of the circumstances under which they were 
made, not misleading.  The obligation to file these periodic reports includes the 
obligation to ensure that they are complete and accurate in all material respects.  See, e.g., 
SEC v. Savoy Indus., Inc., 587 F.2d 1149, 1165 (D.C. Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 
913 (1979).  Information regarding the financial condition of a company is presumptively 
material.  SEC v. Blavin, 760 F.2d 706, 711 (6th
                                                Cir. 1985). 
        
       Take-Two filed materially false and misleading annual reports on Forms 10-K 
with the Commission, attributable directly to its parking transactions, for the fiscal years 
ending October 31, 2000 and October 31, 2001.  The Company filed materially false and 
misleading quarterly reports on Forms 10-Q with the Commission, attributable directly to 
its parking transactions, for the quarters ending January 31, April 30 and July 31, 2000, 
and April 30 and July 31, 2001.  Blau caused these violations of Section 13(a) and Rules 
13a-1, 13a-13 and 12b-20 by substantially assisting the fraud through his participation, 
knowledge and acquiescence in parking transactions which resulted in the filing of 
materially false and misleading reports with knowledge that his conduct was part of an 
overall activity that was improper.

        Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act requires issuers to “make and keep 
books, records, and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the issuer.”  Section 13(b)(2)(B) requires 
issuers to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to 
provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the 
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain the 
accountability of assets.  Take-Two failed to make and keep such books, records and 
accounts and to devise and maintain the required internal accounting controls.  Blau 
caused Take-Two’s violations by his participation, knowledge and acquiescence in 
fraudulent sales and parking transactions that he knew, or was reckless in not knowing, 
would cause such violations. 
 
        Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2 prohibits a director or officer of an issuer from, 
directly or indirectly, making or causing to be made a materially false or misleading 
statement to an accountant in connection with an audit, review, or examination of the 
issuer’s financial statements.  Blau participated in, knew of and acquiesced in fraudulent 
sales and parking transactions that he knew, or was reckless in not knowing, would result 
in false representations to accountants during an audit or review of Take-Two’s financial 
statements.  Blau, therefore, caused Take-Two’s officers to violate Rule 13b2-2. 
 
                                              IV. 
                                                 
        In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the 
sanctions agreed to in Respondent Blau’s Offer. 
 
        Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that: 
 
        Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act and Section 21C of the Exchange 
        Act, Respondent Blau shall cease and  desist from committing or causing any 
        violation and any future violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections  
        10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 
        and 13b2-2; and from causing any violation and any future violation of Sections 
        13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 
        13a-1, 13a-13 and 12b-20.
