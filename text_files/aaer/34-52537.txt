Release No. 2325 / September 30, 2005 
 
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING  
File No. 3-12064 
 
In the Matter of Gregory M. Dearlove, CPA 
 
On September 30, 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission instituted 
administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 102(e) of the Commission's Rules of Practice against 
Gregory M. Dearlove, CPA, alleging that Dearlove engaged in improper professional 
conduct and caused Adelphia Communications Corporation to violate Section 13(a), 
13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 12b-20 
thereunder.  
 
In the Order Instituting Proceedings, the Division of Enforcement and the Office of the 
Chief Accountant allege that Dearlove engaged in improper professional conduct and 
caused Adelphia’s violations of the securities laws in connection with audit of the 
financial statements of Adelphia for the year-ended December 31, 2000.  Dearlove served 
as the engagement partner on Deloitte & Touche LLP’s audit of the financial statements 
contained in Adelphia’s 2000 Form 10-K.  The Division of Enforcement and the Office 
of the Chief Accountant allege that Dearlove engaged in improper professional conduct 
and caused Adelphia’s violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) and 
Rules 13a-1 and 12b-20 of the Exchange Act because Dearlove knew or should have 
known that his failure to plan, conduct and supervise an audit that conformed to 
Generally Accepted Auditing Standards, and his approval of and signature on an 
unqualified audit report which Adelphia filed with its 2000 Form 10-K, would contribute 
to Adelphia’s violations, including its filing of a misleading 2000 Form 10-K, its 
maintenance of an inadequate system of internal accounting controls, and its failure to 
keep its books and records in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.    
 
A hearing will be scheduled to determine whether such allegations are true, to afford the 
respondent an opportunity to establish defenses to the allegations, to determine whether 
remedial action is necessary and appropriate, to determine whether respondent should be 
ordered to cease and desist from causing violations of and any future violations of the 
securities laws, and to determine whether respondent should be ordered to pay 
disgorgement.

date of service of the Order Instituting Proceedings, pursuant to Rule 360(a)(2) of the 
Commission’s Rules of Practice.
