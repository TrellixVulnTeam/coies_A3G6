       On January 7, 2011, we issued an order instituting proceedings ("OIP") against Carl W. 
Jasper, a certified public accountant ("CPA"), pursuant to Commission Rule of Practice 
102(e)(3),  that temporarily suspended him from appearing or practicing before the Commission1

       1 
              Commission Rule of Practice 102(e)(3), 17 C.F.R. § 201.102(e)(3), provides in 
pertinent part that: 

       (i) The Commission, with due regard to the public interest and without preliminary 
       hearing, may, by order, temporarily suspend from appearing or practicing before it 
       any . . . accountant . . . who has been by name: 

              (A) Permanently enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction, by reason of his 
              or her misconduct in an action brought by the Commission, from violating or 
              aiding and abetting the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or 
              of the rules and regulations thereunder; or 

              (B) Found by any court of competent jurisdiction in an action brought by the 
              Commission to which he or she is a party or found by the Commission in any 
              administrative proceeding to which he or she is a party to have violated (unless 
              the violation was found not to have been willful) or aided and abetted the 
              violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or of the rules and 
              regulations thereunder.

as an accountant.2 
                   Jasper has filed a petition, pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(ii),3 
                                                                             requesting that his 
temporary suspension be lifted. 

       Jasper was Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Principal Accounting Officer of 
Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. ("Maxim") during the period from April 1999 through January 
2007.4 
        The Commission filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern 
District of California on December 21, 2007, alleging that Jasper "engaged in a scheme to 
illegally backdate stock options granted to Maxim employees and directors, concealing millions 
of dollars in expenses from investors and significantly overstating the Company's income."  The 
complaint also alleged that Jasper "was aware of instances of backdating, and on repeated 
occasions prepared for the signature of Maxim's then Chief Executive Officer falsely dated 
option grant approval documents to make it appear as though the options had been granted at the 
market price on an earlier date."  The complaint further alleged that Jasper "also knew, or was 
reckless in not knowing, that the Company did not properly account for such options or 
accurately disclose Maxim's option granting practices." 

       A jury found that Jasper violated the antifraud, books and records, false statements and 
omissions to accountants and auditors, and false certifications provisions of the federal securities 
laws.  The jury also found that Jasper aided and abetted Maxim's violations of reporting, 
recordkeeping, and internal controls provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.5 
                                                                                         On July 
21, 2010, the District Court entered a judgment against Jasper permanently enjoining him from

              Jasper, 100 SEC Docket at 36681.  The OIP alleged that Jasper "is and has been a 
CPA licensed to practice in the State of California" and that Jasper's CPA license was inactive 
during his tenure at Maxim. 
       5 
              The jury found that Jasper violated the antifraud provisions in Exchange Act 
Section 10(b), 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5, and 
Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)(1); the books and records 
provisions of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, 17 C.F.R. § 240.13b2-1; the false statements and 
omissions to accountants and auditors provisions of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2, 17 C.F.R.         
§ 240.13b2-2; and the false certifications provisions of Exchange Act Rule 13a-14, 17 C.F.R.    
§ 240.13a-14.  The jury further found that Jasper aided and abetted Maxim's violations of the 
issuer reporting requirements in Exchange Act Section 13(a), 15 U.S.C. § 78m(a), and Exchange 
Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13, 17 C.F.R. §§ 240.12b-20, 240.13a-1, 240.13a-11, 
and 240.13a-13; the books and records provisions of Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(A), 15 
U.S.C. § 78m(b)(2)(A), and the internal controls provisions of Exchange Act Section 
13(b)(2)(B), 15 U.S.C. § 78m(b)(2)(B).

"any future violations of the securities laws or regulations."6 
                                                               The judgment also barred Jasper 
from serving as a director or officer of a publicly-traded company for a period of two years, 
ordered Jasper to pay a civil monetary penalty of $360,000, and ordered him to reimburse Maxim 
for bonuses and stock-sale profits in the amount of $1,869,639. 

       In issuing the OIP, we found that it was "appropriate and in the public interest" that 
Jasper be temporarily suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission, based on 
the District Court's final judgment.  We stated that the temporary suspension would become 
permanent unless Jasper filed a petition challenging it within thirty days of service of the order, 
pursuant to Rule of Practice 102(e)(3)(ii).  We further advised that, pursuant to Rule of Practice 
102(e)(3)(iii), upon receipt of such a petition, we would either lift the temporary suspension, set 
the matter down for hearing, or both. 
 
       In his petition, Jasper requests that the temporary suspension be lifted or modified to a 
limited period "coterminous with the two-year D&O bar" imposed by the District Court.  Jasper 
argues that the jury did not make findings setting forth the specific Maxim options grants with 
respect to which Jasper had committed violations.  According to Jasper, "[i]t is therefore 
impossible to discern from the verdict how many backdated grants the jury found Mr. Jasper was 
aware of, the value of the grants, or the extent of his role in backdating."  Jasper states that the 
jury found him not guilty of three of the eleven charges included in the Commission's complaint, 
and "that the jury asked about the 'responsibility' of various officer for misstatements, 
suggest[ing] it did not view Mr. Jasper as a ringleader in whatever improprieties it may have 
found."  Jasper claims that a permanent suspension would serve no remedial purpose because he 
is unlikely to commit future violations "in the absence of [Maxim's then-CEO] and the culture he 
created at Maxim."  Jasper argues that the violations were "not motivated by self-interest (apart 
from, at best, keeping his job)" and points out his prior lack of any disciplinary history during his 
twenty-eight year career as an accountant and auditor. 

       The Division of Enforcement has not filed an opposition to Jasper's petition. 

       "Rule 102(e)(3) permits the Commission to suspend any accountant or other professional 
or expert who has been permanently enjoined from violating or aiding and abetting the violation 
of the Federal securities laws . . . ."7 
                                      Generally, a respondent in a "follow-on" proceeding is 
precluded from challenging the basis for, or findings in, the underlying injunctive action.8 
                                                                                            At this

stage, it appears that the findings made in the injunctive proceeding and the injunction issued 
against Jasper "justify the continuance of his suspension until it can be determined what, if any, 
action may be appropriate to protect the Commission's process." 9 
                                                                  As provided in Rule 
102(e)(3)(iii), therefore, we will set the matter down for public hearing. 

       Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that this proceeding be set down for public hearing before 
an administrative law judge in accordance with Rule of Practice 110.  As specified in Rule of 
Practice 102(e)(3)(iii), the hearing in this matter shall be expedited in accordance with Rule of 
Practice 500; it is further  

       ORDERED that the administrative law judge shall issue an initial decision no later than 
210 days from the date of service of this Order; and it is further 

       ORDERED that the temporary suspension of Carl W. Jasper, entered on January 7, 2011, 
remain in effect pending a hearing and decision in this matter. 

       By the Commission.
