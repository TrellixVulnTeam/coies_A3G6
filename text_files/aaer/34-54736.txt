                                                   I. 
 
              The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) deems it appropriate and in the 
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against Thomas 
Clark (Respondent or Clark) pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(i) of the Commissions Rules of 
Practice.1
             
 
                                                   II. 
 
              In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the Offer) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the 
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings 
                                                 
1
 Rule 102(e)(3)(i) provides, in relevant part, that: 
 
                 The Commission, with due regard to the public interest and without preliminary hearing, may, by order, . . . 
suspend from appearing or practicing before it any . . . accountant . . . who has been by name . . . permanently 
enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction, by reason of his or her misconduct in an action brought by the 
Commission, from violating or aiding and abetting the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or of 
the rules and regulations thereunder.

herein, except as to the Commissions jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these 
proceedings, and the findings contained in Section III., ¶ 3 below, which are admitted, Respondent 
consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Rule 102(e) 
of the Commissions Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions 
(Order), as set forth below.   
 
                                               III. 
 
              On the basis of this Order and Respondents Offer, the Commission finds that:  
        
                     1.           Thomas Clark, age 58, was, but no longer is, a certified public accountant 
licensed to practice in the State of Minnesota.  In addition to other positions, he served as Chief 
Financial Officer of Health Risk Management, Inc. (HRMI) from 1987 until October 2000 and 
served as the president of HRMIs wholly owned HMO subsidiary from December 2000 until his 
resignation in March 2001. 
        
                     2.           HRMI was, at all relevant times, a Minnesota corporation with its principal 
place of business in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  HRMI was a healthcare management company that, 
among other activities, administered HRM PA, Inc., a small Medicaid HMO in Pennsylvania (the 
HMO).  At all relevant times, HRMIs common stock was registered with the Commission 
pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and traded on 
the NASDAQ National Market. 
        
                     3.           On  January 27, 2006, the Commission filed a complaint against Clark in 
SEC v. Thomas P. Clark, (Civil Action No. 06-cv-00380).  On October 19, 2006, the court entered 
an order permanently enjoining Clark, by consent, from future violations of Sections 10(b) and 
13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder, and aiding and 
abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 
12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder.  Clark was also ordered to pay a $20,000 civil money penalty and 
was barred from acting as an officer or director of a public company for five years. 
 
                           4.           The Commissions complaint alleged, among other things, that: (a) Clark 
 deliberately mischaracterized a $1.35 million payment by HRMI which resulted in HRMI filing 
 materially false and misleading financial statements in the companys quarterly reports on Form 
 10-Q for the second and third quarters of fiscal year 2000;  (b) on August 1, 2000, Clark and one 
 of the HMOs healthcare providers, agreed that HRMI would pay the provider $1.85 million to 
 settle an arbitration initiated by the provider; (c) because the HMOs net worth had declined to 
 the point that state regulators were threatening to put the HMO in receivership, Clark did not 
 want the entire $1.85 million payment to be categorized as an expense; (d) accordingly, Clark 
 negotiated a Consulting Agreement with the provider that disguised $1.35 million of the $1.85 
 million settlement as a pre-paid retainer for consulting services that HRMI never used or needed; 
 (e) Clark disclosed $500,000 of the settlement, and HRMIs legal expenses, in HRMIs second 
 quarter 2000 Form 10-Q, which was filed three weeks after the settlement was reached; (f) Clark 
 failed, however, to disclose the $1.35 million prepaid retainer in that Form 10-Q; (g) Clark 
 finally disclosed the payment in HRMIs third quarter 2000 Form 10-Q, but improperly booked 
 the settlement as a prepaid asset rather than as an expense; (h) in doing so, Clark materially 
                                                2                                                  
---------------------Page 3---------------------

 understated HRMIs expenses for the second quarter of 2000 and materially overstated HRMIs 
 assets for the third quarter of 2000; and (i) Clark hid the Consulting Agreement, and the true 
 dollar amount of the settlement, from HRMIs auditor and falsely represented to HRMIs auditor 
 that HRMI had informed the auditor of all material contracts for the second and third quarters of 
 2000.    
  
                                                             IV. 
 
         In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
impose the sanction agreed to in Respondent Clarks Offer. 
 
         Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that: 
 
              Clark is suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant.   
 
 
 By the Commission.
