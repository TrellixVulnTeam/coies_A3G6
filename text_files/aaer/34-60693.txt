                                                    I.  
 
        The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in 
the public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against 
Daniel F. Stulac (“Respondent” or “Stulac”) pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(i) of the Commission’s 
Rules of Practice. 1 
                     
         
                                                    II. 
 
        In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (“Offer”), which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the purpose  
of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the Commission, or to 
which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings herein, except as 
to the Commission’s jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these proceedings, and the 
findings contained in Section III. 3. below, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry 
                                                           
        1
           Rule 102(e)(3)(i) provides, in relevant part, that:  
         
                The Commission, with due regard to the public inte rest and without preliminary hearing, may, by  
        order, . . . suspend from appearing or practicing before it any . . . accountant . . . who has been by name . . .                     
        [p]ermanently enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction, by reason of his or her misconduct in an                                                             
        action brought by the Commission, from violating or ai  ding an abetting the violation of any provision of  
        the Federal securities laws or of the rules and regulations thereunder.

of this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the  
Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (“Order”), 
as set forth below. 
        
                                              III. 
                                                 
       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that: 
 
       1.      Daniel F. Stulac, age 45, was at all relevant times a certified public accountant 
licensed to practice in the state of California.  Stulac became a partner at Arthur Andersen in 
September 2000 and was the engagement partner on the audit of Peregrine Systems Inc. 
(“Peregrine”) from September 2000 to September 2001.   
 
       2.      At the time Stulac was the engagement partner on the audit, Peregrine was a 
Delaware corporation with principal offices in San Diego, California.  Peregrine’s primary 
business involved selling infrastructure management software.  From its initial public offering in  
April 1997, until it merged with Hewlett-Packard in 2005, Peregrine’s common stock was 
registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 (“Exchange Act”).  It traded on the Nasdaq National Market System from its initial public 
offering until August 30, 2002, when it was delisted and quoted on the Pink Sheets.  In February 
2003, Peregrine announced the restatement of $509 million of revenue it had improperly 
recorded. 
 
       3.     On September 14, 2009, a final judgment was entered against Stulac, permanently 
enjoining him from future violations of Sections 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 
thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and 
Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder, in the civil action entitled Securities and Exchange 
Commission v. Stephen P. Gardner, et al., Civil Action No. 04 CV 2002 (S.D. Cal.). 
 
       4.      The Commission’s Complaint alleged, among other things, that Peregrine and its 
senior officers fraudulently inflated the revenues Peregrine reported in its filings with the 
Commission and elsewhere.  Peregrine improperly recorded millions of dollars of revenue based 
on non-binding arrangements with resellers.  This ultimately caused uncollectible receivables 
from the non-binding arrangements to swell on Peregrine’s balance sheet.  The Complaint further 
alleged that Peregrine’s management improperly wrote off unpaid receivables by falsely 
characterizing the write-offs as “acquisition costs and other.”   According to the Commission’s  
Complaint, Stulac knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that the receivables Peregrine intended 
to write off were unrelated to acquisitions and should not have been recorded as “acquisition 
costs and other.”  The Complaint also alleged that Stulac knew, or was reckless in not knowing, 
that Peregrine’s 2001 financial statements improperly recognized millions of dollars of revenue 
from agreements with resellers.  The Complaint alleged that, by engaging in this and other 
conduct, Stulac violated the anti-fraud provisions of the Exchange Act, and aided and abetted 
                                               2

violations of the reporting provisions of the Exchange Act.  
 
                                                 IV. 
                                                    
       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanction 
agreed to in Respondent’s Offer. 
 
       Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that: 
 
       A.      Respondent is suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission as                           
an accountant. 
 
                    B. After five (5) years from the date of this order, Respondent may request that 
the Commission consider his reinstatement by submitting an application (attention: Office of 
the Chief Accountant) to resume appearing or practicing before the Commission as: 
 
                                 1. a preparer or reviewer, or a person responsible for the preparation or 
review, of any public company’s financial statements that are filed with the Commission.  Such 
an application must satisfy the Commission that Respondent’s work in his practice before the 
Commission will be reviewed either by the independent audit committee of the public company 
for which he works or in some other acceptable manner, as long as he practices before the 
Commission in this capacity; and/or 
 
        2.             an independent accountant. Su   ch an application must satisfy the 
Commission that: 
 
                             (a) Respondent, or the public accounting firm with which he is 
associated, is registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight       Board (“Board”) in 
accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and such registration continues to be effective; 
 
                       (b)     Respondent, or the registered   public accounting firm with which he 
is associated, has been inspected by the Board and that inspection did not identify any criticisms  
of or potential defects in the Respondent’s or the firm’s quality control system that would 
indicate that the Respondent will not receive appropriate supervision; 

                       (c)     Respondent has resolved all di  sciplinary issues with the Board, and 
has complied with all terms and conditions of any sanctions imposed by the Board (other than 
reinstatement by the Commission); and 
 
                       (d)     Respondent acknowledges      his responsibility, as long as 
Respondent appears or practices before the Commission as an independent accountant, to 
comply with all requirements of the Commission and the Board, including, but not limited to, all 
                                                  3

requirements relating to registration, inspections, concurring partner reviews and quality control 
standards. 
 
       C.      The Commission will consider an application by Respondent to resume appearing 
or practicing before the Commission provided that his state CPA license is current and he has 
resolved all other disciplinary issues with the applicable state boards of accountancy.  However, 
if state licensure is dependent on reinstatement by the Commission, the Commission will 
consider an application on its other merits.  The Commission’s review may include consideration 
of, in addition to the matters referenced above, any other matters relating to Respondent’s 
character, integrity, professional conduct, or qualifications to appear or practice before the 
Commission. 
        
       By the Commission.
