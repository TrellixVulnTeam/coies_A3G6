                                           II. 
 
      In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer

                                                III. 
 
                                                                                 1
        On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds  that: 
 
                                            Summary 
  
       1.      Respondent, a former employee of Diebold, Inc. (“Diebold”), entered into a 
cooperation agreement with the Division of Enforcement on March 23, 2010, in connection with the 
Commission’s investigation of violations of the federal securities laws at Diebold, and related 
enforcement proceedings.  That investigation and related enforcement proceedings against the 
company and certain of its former senior executives are now concluded.  The Commission, having 
taken into consideration Respondent’s substantial cooperation, enters this Order resolving the matter 
with respect to Respondent. 
 
       2.      As described below, Respondent, at the direction of management, made improper 
accounting entries in Diebold’s books, records, and accounts in 2003 and 2004, while he was a 
finance manager at the company.  As a result of the conduct described herein, Respondent caused 
violations of Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act, and violated Rule 13b2-1 thereunder. 
     
                                         Respondent 
 
       3.      Respondent Charles Loveless, 50, is a resident of Massillon, Ohio.  He was a finance 
manager at Diebold from 2001 to 2006, and reported directly to Michael McKenna.  From 2006 to 
2008, Loveless was Diebold’s Manager of External Reporting.  In January 2008, Loveless 
separated from Diebold.  Currently, Loveless is the Finance Director and Controller of a private 
company in North Canton, Ohio.  Loveless is a certified public accountant in Ohio.  His license is 
inactive.  Loveless entered into a cooperation agreement with the Division on March 23, 2010.

from 2005 to 2006, and the CFO of Libbey, Inc. from May 2007 through June 2010.  Geswein

of North American Finance from 2005 through 2007.  In July 2007, McKenna separated from

company in Utica, New York.  McKenna is a certified public accountant in Ohio.  His license is 
inactive.  McKenna entered into a cooperation agreement with the Division of Enforcement on 
April 19, 2010.   
                                            Background 
 
       10.     Loveless is a former employee of Diebold, Inc., a public company based in North 
Canton, Ohio that manufactures and sells ATMs and bank security systems.  Loveless was a 
finance manager at Diebold from 2001 to 2006, and the company’s Manager of External Reporting 
from 2006 to 2008.  In 2003 and 2004, Loveless, at the direction of management, made improper 
accounting entries in Diebold’s books, records, and accounts.  These improper entries assisted the 
company and its management in artificially inflating Diebold’s reported earnings to meet forecasts.   
 
       11.     Under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), an issuer is required to 
accrue for anticipated liabilities.  Under GAAP, a liability should be released upon the occurrence 
of a specified event or when the estimate should be revised in response to new information.  GAAP 
prohibits maintaining general or excess reserves (e.g., “cookie jar” reserves).   
        
       12.     As a finance manager at Diebold, Loveless had certain accounting responsibilities 
for Diebold’s North American sales commission accrual account.  This account consolidated 
several sub-accounts maintained by accounting personnel in Diebold’s North American business 
units.  In 2003 and 2004, Loveless, and others, including management of Diebold, knew that this 
account was frequently underaccrued because the business units were not properly recording 
liabilities.  At the direction of management, no action was taken to correct it.  In 2003 and 2004, 
the account was understated by approximately $2.7 million and $300,000, respectively.        
 
                                                3  
---------------------Page 4---------------------

       13.    Loveless also had accounting responsibilities for Diebold’s Shipped Not Installed  
accrual account, which the company at times used as a cookie jar reserve.  At the direction of 
management, on October 4, 2003, Loveless made an improper out-of-period entry increasing the 
accrual in this account by $250,000, effective as of September 2003 (the third-quarter 2003).  On 
October 7, 2003, Loveless improperly reversed this accrual in the fourth-quarter 2003.  There was 
no legitimate accounting justification for these entries.  The improper entries assisted management 
in artificially inflating the company’s reported earnings for the fourth-quarter of 2003. 

       14.    As a result of the conduct described above, Respondent Loveless caused Diebold’s 
violations of Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act, which requires Commission registrants to 
make and keep books, records, and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly 
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the registrant. 
        
       15.     As a result of the conduct described above, Loveless violated Rule 13b2-1 of the 
Exchange Act, which states that no person shall, directly or indirectly, falsify or cause to be 
falsified, any book, record or account subject to section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act. 
 
                                          Cooperation 
        
       16.     Loveless entered into a cooperation agreement with the Division of Enforcement on 
March 23, 2010, in connection with the Commission’s investigation of violations of the federal 
securities laws at Diebold and related enforcement proceedings.  As a result of the investigation, the 
Commission filed the following enforcement actions, all of which are now concluded:   
 
       17.     On June 2, 2010, the Commission filed a settled enforcement action against 
Diebold in which it consented to a final judgment ordering injunctive relief and a $25 million civil 
penalty.  See SEC v. Diebold, Inc., Civ. Action No. 1:10-CV-00908 (D.D.C.) / Lit. Rel. No. 21543. 
 
       18.     On June 2, 2010, the Commission filed a settled compensation claw-back action 
against Walden O’Dell, Diebold’s former CEO and Chairman, pursuant to Section 304 of the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, in which he consented to a final judgment ordering him to reimburse 
$470,016 in cash bonuses, 30,000 shares of Diebold stock, and stock options for 85,000 shares of 
Diebold stock.  See SEC. v. O’Dell, Civ. Action No. 1:10-CV-00909 (D.D.C.) / Lit. Rel. No. 
21543. 
 
       19.     On June 2, 2010, the Commission filed a contested enforcement action against 
Gregory Geswein, Diebold’s former CFO.  On May 26, 2015, pursuant to a settlement, the court 
entered a final consent decree against Geswein ordering him to pay $680,000 in disgorgement, a 
$170,000 civil penalty, and prohibiting him for three years from acting as an officer or director of a 
public company.  See SEC v. Geswein, et al., Civ. Action No. 5:10-CV-01235 (N.D. Ohio) / Lit. 
Rel. Nos. 21543 and 23268. 
 
       20.     On June 2, 2010, the Commission filed a contested enforcement action against 
Kevin Krakora, Diebold’s former Controller and later CFO.  On May 26, 2015, pursuant to a 
settlement, the court entered a final consent decree against Krakora ordering him to pay $400,000 in 

                                                4  
---------------------Page 5---------------------

disgorgement, a $100,000 civil penalty, prohibiting him for three years from acting as an officer or 
director of a public company, and prohibiting him from appearing or practicing before the 
Commission as an accountant, with a right to apply for reinstatement after three years.  See SEC v. 
Geswein, et al., Civ. Action No. 5:10-CV-01235 (N.D. Ohio) / Lit. Rel. Nos. 21543 and 23268.  
 
       21.     On June 2, 2010, the Commission filed a contested enforcement action against 
Sandra Miller, Diebold’s former Director of Corporate Accounting.  On May 26, 2015, pursuant to 
a settlement, the court entered a final consent decree against Miller that permanently enjoins her 
from aiding and abetting any violation of Section 13(a), Section 13(b)(2)(A), and Section 
13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, and 12b-20 thereunder, and 
ordered disgorgement of $29,057, which was waived, and no penalty imposed, based on her 
financial condition.  See SEC v. Geswein, et al., Civ. Action No. 5:10-CV-01235 (N.D. Ohio) / Lit. 
Rel. Nos. 21543 and 23268. 
 
       22.    Loveless provided significant cooperation in connection with the Commission’s 
investigation of this matter and the related enforcement actions.   
                                                  
                                               IV. 
                                                  
       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in Respondent Loveless’s Offer. 
        
       Accordingly, pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, it is hereby ORDERED that: 
 
       A.      Respondent Loveless cease and desist from committing or causing any violations 
and any future violations of Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder.

limitations defense.

debt for the violation by Respondent of the federal securities laws or any regulation or order 
issued under such laws, as set forth in Section 523(a)(19) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. § 
523(a)(19).
