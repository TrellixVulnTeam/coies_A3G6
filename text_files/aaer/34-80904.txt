                                               III. 
 
                                                                                1
        On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission  finds  that 
 
                                            Summary 

       1.      This matter involves improper professional conduct by RSM US LLP (“RSM”) 
engagement manager Hanmer, while performing the 2011 audit of Madison Capital Energy 
Income Fund I LP (“Fund I”), a fund formed for the general purpose of acquiring  oil and gas 
royalty interests to generate a return for its investors.  During the course of the Fund I engagement, 
Hanmer repeatedly violated professional standards, including  by failing  to conduct the 2011 Fund I 
audit (hereinafter “Fund I audit”) in conformity  with Generally Accepted Auditing Standards 
(“GAAS”). 
        
       2.      Hanmer was aware but failed to adequately respond to the fact that the Fund I 
financial statements failed to separately report the fair value of the investment in each oil and gas 
royalty interest held by Fund I, as required by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 
(“GAAP”).  In addition,  Hanmer knew that adequate procedures had not been performed in 
auditing  the fair value of the investment in the underlying  royalty interests and took steps to 
conceal this fact from RSM personnel.  Hanmer also did not perform adequate audit procedures on 
Fund I’s schedule of investments to obtain sufficient evidence for their fair value.  Finally,  Hanmer 
failed to adequately plan and assess the risk of the Fund I audit before commencing field work for 
the audit. 
 
                                           Respondent 

       3.      Lisa Hanmer (“Hanmer”), age 44, currently resides in Oregon, Wisconsin and is 
a certified public accountant licensed to practice in Wisconsin.  Hanmer began working at RSM in 
1996, became a partner in 2013, and resigned from the firm, effective March 31, 2015.  Hanmer 
served as the RSM manager for the Fund I audit and held the title of director at the time.  As a 
result of the Commission’s investigation  into this matter, which caused RSM to conduct its own 
internal review, RSM’s Quality Control Inquiry Committee (“QCIC”) convened on February 7, 
2015 and recommended that Hanmer’s employment with RSM be terminated, which prompted 
Hanmer’s March 31, 2015 resignation from RSM.  After resigning,  Hanmer performed accounting 
consulting  work. 
        
                                    Other Relevant Parties 

       4.      RSM US LLP, a limited  liability  partnership with its headquarters in Chicago, 
Illinois,  is a public  accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight 
Board (“PCAOB”).  Founded in 1926, RSM has about 80 offices in the United States with annual 
revenue totaling  approximately $1.4 billion.   Fund I engaged RSM, through its Madison,

       The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent’s Offer and are not binding on any other person or 
entity in this or any other proceeding.

Wisconsin office, to “perform an audit of [Fund I’s] statement of net assets, including  the 
schedules of investments as of December 31, 2011 and a review of the related statements of 
operations, changes in partners’ capital and cash flows for the year then ended . . . in accordance 
with auditing  standards generally accepted in the United States of America” in May 2012. 
                
       5.      Daniel Millmann (“Millmann”), age 54, currently resides in Madison, Wisconsin 
and is a certified public accountant licensed to practice in Wisconsin.  Millmann  has worked at 
RSM since 1990 and became a partner in 2005.  Millmann  served as the RSM engagement partner 
for the Fund I audit. 
        
       6.      Derik J. Todd (“Todd”), age 51, currently resides in Madison, Wisconsin.  Since 
2007, Todd has served as the President of Madison Capital Investments LLC (“MCI”).  Todd has 
organized private placements of equity interests in oil and gas limited  partnerships through MCI 
and other entities.  Todd, on behalf of Fund I, retained RSM to perform the Fund I audit and served 
as RSM’s primary contact with Fund I. 

       7.      Madison Capital Investments LLC (“MCI”) is a Wisconsin limited  liability 
company, controlled  by Todd, based in Madison, Wisconsin.  MCI organized a number of private 
placements of equity interests in oil and gas limited  partnerships since 2009, including  Fund I.  
These private placements were marketed to accredited investors under Regulation D Rule 506 
through separate broker-dealers and investment advisers. 

       8.      Madison Capital Energy Income Fund I LP (“Fund I”) is a Delaware limited 
partnership, controlled  by Todd, based in Madison, Wisconsin.  Fund I was formed for the general 
purpose of acquiring oil and gas royalty interests to generate a return for its investors.  Fund I 
raised almost $3 million  from approximately  50 investors. 

                                           Background 

               Fund I Audit 
 
       9.      MCI pitched its funds to broker-dealers and investments advisers, and they in turn 
introduced these funds to prospective investors.  These broker-dealers and investment advisers 
generally required certain information  before they agreed to place these funds on their platforms, 
including  audited financial statements.  Thus, MCI engaged RSM on May 16, 2012 to perform an 
audit of Fund I’s statement of net assets as of December 31, 2011 and a review of the related 
statements of operations, changes in partners’ capital and cash flows for the year then ended (the 
               2
“audit report”).   RSM   issued its final audit report to Fund I on May 30, 2012.  This report 
contained an unqualified  opinion  on Fund I’s statement of net assets and a review conclusion, 
made in accordance with AICPA standards, on the other financial statements issued by Fund I. 
        

                                               
2
       This Order references the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”) standards in 
effect at the time of the Fund I audit.  These standards are encompassed in GAAS. 

                                                  3 
---------------------Page 4---------------------

       10.    In the Fund I audit report, RSM opined that the Fund I statement of net assets 
“presents fairly, in all material respects, the financial position  of [Fund I] as of December 31, 2011, 
in conformity with accounting principles  generally accepted in the United States of America.” 
        
       11.    The Fund I audit report was subsequently distributed by MCI to broker-dealers and 
investment advisers.  These broker-dealers and investment advisers reviewed the Fund I audit 
report in connection with their due diligence  review for MCI’s later funds and placed MCI’s later 
funds on their investment platforms with the impression that RSM properly and adequately audited 
Fund I’s statement of net assets.  RSM generally understood how MCI intended to utilize  the final 
Fund I audit report.  Fund I’s only material assets were interests in oil and gas royalty properties.  
As such, auditing  the value of those assets was the primary purpose for MCI retaining  RSM to 
conduct the Fund I statement of net assets audit. 
 
       12.    Hanmer functioned in the role of engagement manager for the Fund I audit and 
performed the most work on the audit, including  performing or overseeing the field work and 
testing for the audit (including  its documentation in the workpapers) and drafting the Fund I audit 
report.  At the time of the Fund I audit, Hanmer was a director at RSM whose primary experience 
was in auditing privately-held  manufacturing companies.  Fund I was the first oil and gas fund she 
had audited in her career. 
        
       13.    Millmann  was the engagement partner for the Fund I audit.  At the time of the Fund 
I audit, Millmann’s  primary experience was in auditing privately-held  manufacturing companies 
and professional service organizations.  Millmann  had never worked on an oil and gas fund prior to 
the Fund I audit. 
 
       14.    The Fund I audit fell under the auspices of RSM’s financial services group, which 
specializes in audits of broker-dealers, futures commodities  merchants, non-registered proprietary 
trading firms, business development companies, commodity  pools, hedge funds, mutual funds, 
small business investment company funds, registered investment advisers, and private equity funds 
(hereinafter “Financial  Services Practice”).  At the time of the Fund I audit, Millmann  and Hanmer 
were not on RSM’s preapproved list for Financial Services Practice audits.  This list identifies 
competent individuals  to perform audits for the Financial Services Practice, the purpose of which is 
to provide reasonable assurance that such audits are performed according to firm and professional 
standards.  Because Millmann and Hanmer were not on the preapproved list for Financial Services 
Practice audits, the Regional Professional Practices Officer (“RPPO”) for the RSM Great Lakes 
Region was required, according to RSM policy,  to approve the staffing of Millmann  and Hanmer 
on the engagement, which the RPPO ultimately did,  but only after audit field work had been 
substantially  completed. 
        
               Relevant RSM Quality Control Policies and Procedures 
 
       15.    All RSM partners and other professionals are required to adhere to all applicable 
provisions  of the AICPA Code of Professional Conduct, as well as applicable ethics requirements 
of the PCAOB and state boards of accountancy. 
        

                                                 4 
---------------------Page 5---------------------

       16.    RSM’s client acceptance and continuation policies and procedures require the 
engagement partner to carefully evaluate the prospective client prior to acceptance by: (i) 
evaluating the integrity  and competence of top management and majority owners; (ii) evaluating 
the prospective client’s financial condition;  (iii) reviewing  RSM’s independence requirements to 
determine compliance with respect to the prospective client; (iv) ensuring that qualified 
professional staff and other functional and industry specialists are available; and (v) 
communicating  directly with the predecessor auditor.  Acceptance of all prospective clients must 
be approved by the regional assurance leader or his or her designee. 

       17.    RSM uses the RSM Risk Assessment Model (“MRAM”), an internally  developed 
electronic tool that assists engagement teams in performing consistent and comprehensive 
evaluations of risk.  In arriving at an engagement risk assessment, the MRAM considers several 
risk-rating factors, such as industry, financial condition,  governance, management, control 
environment,  size, complexity,  and international  reach.  In addition to providing  for the approval of 
engagement acceptance or continuance and engagement staffing, the MRAM identifies potential 
risks of material misstatement, the need for the involvement  of subject matter experts, matters 
requiring consultation,  and other engagement risks, which allows RSM to plan and perform more 
effective and efficient risk-based audits.  RSM’s policies in this area are designed to provide 
reasonable assurance that RSM will undertake or continue relationships  and engagements only 
where RSM: (i) has considered the integrity  of the client and the risks associated with providing 
professional services under the circumstances; (ii) is competent to perform the engagement and has 
the capabilities and resources to do so; (iii)  can comply with the applicable legal and ethical 
requirements; and (iv) can reach an understanding with the client regarding the nature, scope, and 
limitations  of the services to be performed. 

       18.    RSM designed its policies  and procedures to provide reasonable assurance that 
RSM has sufficient professional personnel with the capabilities,  competence, and commitment  to 
ethical principles necessary to perform RSM’s engagements in accordance with professional 
standards and regulatory and legal requirements and to enable RSM to issue reports that are 
appropriate under the circumstances.  RSM’s National Office of Risk Management (“NORM”), in 
consultation with the Regional Professional Practice Offices, approves a list of assurance partners, 
directors, and other professionals who have designations within  RSM’s quality control system.  
This list identifies individuals  by industry and engagement risk rating who are authorized to serve 
as engagement partners and managers, engagement quality  reviewers, industry specialists, 
independent report reviewers, SEC compliance reviewers, and subject matter experts.  RSM 
assigns an individual  to a specific engagement after considering the professional competence and 
industry experience of the individual,  together with the degree of knowledge, skills,  and abilities 
required under the circumstances.  RSM’s RPPO has the ability  to approve RSM staff, who are not 
on the preapproved list, for a given audit. 

       19.    To provide reasonable assurance that engagements are consistently performed 
properly, RSM develops, maintains, and provides personnel with electronic manuals, software 
tools, and subject matter guidance materials, which address: (i) audit methodology,  (ii) engagement 
supervision,  (iii)  appropriate documentation of work performed, and (iv) identifying  matters for 
consultation or consideration by more experienced professionals.  RSM’s audit methodology 
dictates that the engagement team plan the audit work so that an effective audit is performed, 

                                                 5 
---------------------Page 6---------------------

designing  procedures that are responsive to the risks of material misstatement identified in the 
MRAM. 

       20.    RSM has also implemented  a QCIC, which is charged with reviewing engagements 
selected based on certain triggering  events such as engagements identified  in PCAOB or internal 
inspections. 

                              Withdrawal  of Fund I Audit Report 

       21.    RSM informed the Commission  staff in early 2015 that the Commission  staff’s 
investigation  caused it to conduct its own internal review of the Fund I audit.  In connection with 
this internal review, the RSM QCIC convened on February 7, 2015 and concluded that: Hanmer’s 
conduct on the Fund I audit departed from professional standards and firm policies to a degree that 
warranted a recommendation to separate Hanmer from RSM. 

       22.    Subsequently,  Millmann,  on behalf of RSM, in a February 23, 2015 letter to MCI, 
withdrew its Fund I audit report based on “significant  concerns that certain auditing procedures 
[RSM] considered necessary in the circumstances existing  at the time of the engagement were 
omitted from the audit of the statement of assets, including  Fund I’s schedule of investments, and 
[RSM’s] review of the other financial statements.”  The Fund I audit report was withdrawn after 
Fund I’s offering period closed and after investors had already invested. 

                                     Fund I Audit Failures 

       23.    Hanmer failed to conduct the Fund I audit in conformity with GAAS. 

       24.    Contrary to RSM’s client acceptance and engagement performance policies 
described above, field work for the Fund I audit had begun before (i) RSM’s audit planning 
documents were approved and (ii) RSM had cleared the Fund I engagement through the MRAM.  
As a result, RSM did not appropriately assess the risk for the Fund I engagement and effectively 
plan procedures for the audit that would be responsive to the risks of material misstatement 
identified  in the MRAM, and consequently, the Fund I audit was conducted without effective audit 
procedures that were expected to reduce the audit risk of material misstatement. 

       25.    In addition,  contrary to RSM’s engagement staffing policy described above, 
Millmann  and Hanmer, who were not included  on the preapproved list for Financial Services 
Practice audits, were not approved by the RPPO before they began working on the audit.  
Consequently, RSM had no assurance that competent personnel were staffed on the audit before 
substantive audit procedures were performed. 

       26.    RSM issued an audit report containing an unqualified  opinion  on the Fund I 
statement of net assets; however, the Fund I financial statements, including  the statement of net 
assets, were not in conformity with GAAP.  Specifically,  ASC 946-210-50-6  requires breaking out 
and reporting the value of each individual  fund asset on the schedule of investments that are more 
than 5 percent of total net assets.  Notwithstanding this GAAP disclosure requirement, the final 
Fund I schedule of investments only reported the combined cost and fair values of all of the royalty 
interests purchased by the fund.  It did not report the values of Fund I’s individual  royalty interests.  
                                                6 
---------------------Page 7---------------------

       27.    Hanmer knew that the Fund I financial statements were not in conformity with 
GAAP and took steps to conceal this fact from RSM personnel.  Specifically,  before Hanmer sent 
the final audit report to Fund I, the concurring review partner assigned to the Fund I audit clearly 
alerted Hanmer that Fund I’s royalty interests needed to be broken out individually  to be in 
conformity with GAAP.  Submitting  to client pressure to release the Fund I audit report, Hanmer 
intentionally  disregarded her concurring review partner’s comment and sent the final audit report, 
including  the Fund I schedule of investments that did not include a proposed adjustment to break-
out individual  royalty interests, to MCI.  To evade detection, Hanmer sent her concurring review 
partner a different schedule of investments – which was not sent to Fund I – that purported to 
incorporate the concurring review partner’s comment, but, in reality, included fictitious  fair values 
for individual  royalty interests. 

       28.    Hanmer did not perform adequate audit procedures on Fund I’s schedule of 
investments to obtain sufficient evidence for their fair value.  Fund I valued the royalty interests it 
held using engineering  software that accounts for a number of inputs/factors when determining 
future production and prices.  The RSM valuation  specialist assigned to the audit concluded that 
the valuation methodology  employed by Fund I “does not appear unreasonable” but deferred to 
others on the audit team to confirm a number of items, including  that the value of the individual 
royalty interests purchased and owned by Fund I were actually reflected in Fund I’s valuation 
report.  Hanmer never confirmed that the royalty interests purchased by Fund I were reflected in 
the Fund I valuation report.  Instead, Hanmer falsified the schedule of investments workpapers – 
by manually  inserting the initials  of a staff member assigned to the Fund I audit next to certain 
audit procedures – to conceal that required audit work was not completed. 

       29.    Hanmer failed to adequately plan the Fund I audit before beginning  field work for 
the Fund I.  This field work, performed without the benefit of an audit plan, was done before 
Hanmer had an understanding of Fund I and its business.  As a result, the Fund I audit was 
conducted without effective audit procedures that were expected to reduce the audit risk of material 
misstatement. 

       30.    Hanmer failed to adequately assess the risk of the Fund I audit (through  RSM’s 
MRAM process) before commencing field work for the audit.  As a result, the Fund I audit was 
conducted without effective audit procedures that were expected to reduce the audit risk of material 
misstatement. 

       31.    The Fund I audit had other significant deficiencies.  For example, the required work 
program for subsequent events was never completed and no tests were performed to determine 
whether there were unrecorded liabilities  that needed to be disclosed at year end.  As engagement 
manager, Hanmer had responsibility  for performing this required work program. 

                              Violations of Professional Standards 

               Failure to exercise due professional care (AU § 230) 

       32.    AU Section 230 requires that an auditor exercise due professional care in the 
performance of an audit and the preparation of an audit report.  AU § 230.01.  This standard 

                                                 7 
---------------------Page 8---------------------

requires the auditor to plan and perform his work with due professional care.  Id. § 230.02.  Due 
professional care imposes a responsibility  upon each professional within  an independent auditor’s 
organization  to conduct field work and reporting with reasonable care and diligence  and to possess 
the degree of skill  commonly  possessed by other auditors.  Id. §§ 230.02-.05.  Auditors should be 
assigned to tasks and supervised commensurate with their level of knowledge, skill,  and ability  so 
that they can evaluate the audit evidence they are examining.  Id. § 230.06.  Due professional care 
requires the auditor to exercise professional skepticism, which is an attitude that includes a 
questioning  mind and a critical assessment of audit evidence.  Id. § 230.07. 

       33.    As a result of the conduct described above, Respondent failed to exercise due 
professional care, as required by AU Section 230, when conducting the Fund I audit. 

               Failure to adequately plan the audit (AU § 311) 

       34.    AICPA standards require that an auditor adequately plan field work for an audit.  
AU § 311.01.  Audit planning  involves developing  an overall audit strategy for the expected 
conduct, organization,  and staffing of the audit.  Id. § 311.02.  Obtaining  an understanding of the 
entity and its environment,  including  its internal control, is an essential part of planning  and 
performing an audit in accordance with GAAS.  Id. § 311.03.  The auditor must plan the audit so 
that it is responsive to the assessment of the risk of material misstatement based on the auditor’s 
understanding of the entity and its environment, including  its internal control.  Id.  The auditor 
must develop an audit plan in which the auditor documents the audit procedures to be used that, 
when performed, are expected to reduce audit risk to an acceptably low level.  Id. § 311.19. 

       35.    As a result of the conduct described above, Respondent failed to adequately plan 
the Fund I audit within the meaning of AU Section 311. 

               Failure to consider audit risk and materiality in conducting the audit (AU § 312) 

       36.    According to AICPA standards, the auditor must consider audit risk and must 
determine a materiality level for the financial statements taken as a whole for the purpose of: (i) 
determining  the extent and nature of risk assessment procedures; (ii) identifying  and assessing the 
risks of material misstatement; (iii)  determining  the nature, timing,  and extent of further audit 
procedures; and (iv) evaluating whether the financial statements taken as a whole are presented 
fairly, in all material respects, in conformity with GAAP.  AU § 312.11.  The auditor should 
perform risk assessment procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement both at the 
financial statement and the relevant assertion levels.  Id. §312.12. 

       37.    As a result of the conduct described above, Respondent did not properly consider 
audit risk, as required by AU Section 312, when planning  the Fund I audit. 

               Failure to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence (AU § 326) 

       38.    AICPA standards require that: “[t]he auditor must obtain sufficient appropriate 
audit evidence by performing audit procedures to afford reasonable basis for an opinion  regarding 
the financial statements under audit.”  AU § 326.01.  Sufficiency is the measure of the quantity of

The quantity of audit evidence needed is affected by the risk of misstatement (the greater the risk, 
the more audit evidence is likely  to be required) and also by the quality of such audit evidence (the 
higher the quality,  the less the audit evidence that may be required).  Id. 

       39.    As a result of the conduct described above, Respondent did not obtain sufficient 
appropriate audit evidence for the Fund I audit within the meaning of AU Section 326. 

               Failure to ascertain the occurrence of subsequent events (AU § 560)

the period after the balance-sheet date for the purpose of ascertaining the occurrence of subsequent 
events that may require adjustment or disclosure essential to a fair presentation of the financial 
statements in conformity with GAAP.  AU § 560.12.  These procedures should be performed at or 
near the date of the auditor's report.  Id. 

       41.    As a result of the conduct described above, Respondent did not comply with AU 
Section 560.

consisting of a single instance of highly  unreasonable conduct or repeated instances of 
unreasonable conduct, each resulting in a violation  of applicable professional standards, that 
indicate a lack of competence to practice before the Commission). 
        
                                             Findings 
        
       43.    Based on the foregoing, the Commission  finds that Respondent engaged in 
improper professional conduct within the meaning of Section 4C(a)(2) of the Exchange Act and 
Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) of the Commission’s  Rules of Practice.

        In view of the foregoing, the Commission  deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in Respondent’s Offer.
