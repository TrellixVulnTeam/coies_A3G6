          For Review of Disciplinary Action Taken by the
 
                                 
   PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD
 

      On June 26, 2009, Gately & Associates, LLC (the "Firm") and James P. Gately, CPA 
(together with the Firm, "Applicants") filed an application for Commission review of disciplinary 
action taken by the by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the "Board").  The 
Board found that Applicants violated Board Rule 4006 by failing to cooperate with a Board 
inspection, and barred Gately from associating with any registered public accounting firm and 
permanently revoked the Firm's registration.  

      Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("Sarbanes-Oxley"), the Board's sanctions were 
automatically stayed upon Applicants' application to the Commission for review.  Sarbanes-
Oxley Section 105 states that an "[a]pplication to the Commission for review . . . of any 
disciplinary action of the Board shall operate as a stay of any such disciplinary action, unless and 
until the Commission orders . . . that no such stay shall continue to operate."   On August 5, 1

2010, the Commission issued an opinion (the "Commission Opinion") affirming the findings and 
disciplinary sanctions imposed by the Board.2 
                                               

       The Board has requested clarification as to whether the Sarbanes-Oxley Section 105 stay 
"continues to operate or was effectively terminated by" the order accompanying the Commission 
Opinion.  Under Rule 401(e)(1) of the Commission's Rules of Practice, the "Commission may, at 
any time, on its own motion determine whether to lift the automatic stay" of Board action under 
Section 105(e) of Sarbanes-Oxley.   Rule 401(e)(2) states that "[t]he Commission may lift a stay 3
summarily, without notice and opportunity for hearing."4 

       The Commission Opinion concluded, after considering the public interest and the 
protection of investors, that revoking the Firm's registration and barring Gately from association 
are appropriate remedial sanctions.  These same considerations support terminating the stay of 
these sanctions.  As the Commission Opinion concluded, "[g]iven the nature and pattern of 
violative conduct reflected in this case, the revocation of registration and bar imposed by the 
Board are appropriate to protect the public interest in securing regulatory oversight over the 
activities of registered accounting firms."   

       Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that the automatic stay of the Board sanctions imposed on 
Applicants pending the Commission's review be, and it hereby is, terminated. 

       For the Commission by the Office of the General Counsel, pursuant to delegated 
authority.

submission of affidavits or presentation of oral arguments").
