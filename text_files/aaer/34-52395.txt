                                              I.  
   
       The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate to issue an 
order of forthwith suspension of  Steven J.  Allan (“Respondent” or “Allan”) pursuant to Rule 
102(e)(2) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R.                1 
                                                         ' 200.102(e)(2)].    
 
                                             II.  
       The Commission finds that: 
 
       A.                       Respondent 
 
       1.     Steven J. Allan, approximately 54, of Los Altos, California, was a certified public 
accountant (“CPA”) in California during 1993 and 1994.  Also during 1993 and through part of 
1994, Allan was the chief financial officer for Media Vision Technology, Inc. (“Media Vision”),  
then a public company located in Fremont, California. 
 
 
                                                 
1 
       Rule 102(e)(2) provides in pertinent part:  “any person whose license to practice as an 
accountant . . . has been revoked or suspended in any State; or any person who has been 
convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude shall be forthwith suspended 
from appearing or practicing before the Commission.”

         B.      Allan Was Convicted of Fraud and Securities Laws Violations  
      
         2.      On April 4, 2003, a judgment of conviction was entered against Allan in United 
 States v. Steven Allan, No. CR-98-40167 DLJ, a criminal action filed in the United States District 
 Court for the Northern District of California.  After a trial, Allan was found guilty of three counts 
 of fraud by wire communication and aiding and abetting such fraud, under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1343 and 
 2, and two counts of falsifying books and records of a public company and lying to the company’s  
 auditors, under Sections 13(b)(2) and 32(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange 
 Act”) and Rule 13b2-2 thereunder, and 18 U.S.C. § 2.   
  
         3.      As a result of the conviction, in April 2003, Allan was sentenced to 40 months 
 imprisonment in a federal penitentiary and was ordered to pay restitution.   
  
         C.      Allan’s CPA Certificate Was Revoked  
  
         4.      Effective August 29, 2003, by stipulated settlement, the California Board of 
 Accountancy revoked Allan’s CPA Certificate (CPA 21502), for violation of Business and 
 Professions Code, Division 3, Chapter 1, § 5100 (a), based on his conviction in the federal criminal 
 case for five felony counts, each substantially related to the practice of public accountancy. 
                               
                                                    III. 
          
         In view of the foregoing, the Commission finds that Allan has  been convicted of a felony 
 within the meaning of Rule 102(e)(2) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, and that Allan’s 
 license to practice as an accountant in California has been revoked. 
  
         Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that Steven J.         Allan is forthwith suspended from appearing 
 or practicing before the Commission pursuant to  Rule 102(e)(2) of the  Commission’s Rules of 
 Practice. 
  
  
  By the Commission.
