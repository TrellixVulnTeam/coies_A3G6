       On the basis of this Order and Respondents Offer, the Commission finds  1
                                                                                 that: 
 
                                          SUMMARY 
 
       During the time period from fiscal year 2008 through the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, 
JDA Software Group, Inc. (JDA), a software solutions company, materially misstated its revenue, 
net income, and other financial metrics in certain of its annual and quarterly reports filed with the 
Commission and in certain of its earnings releases.  In particular, JDA failed to properly record and 
report revenue from its software license sales in the correct accounting periods because it did not 
establish vendor specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE) for Managed Services and 
certain types of consulting arrangements sold in conjunction with its software licenses.  In addition, 
JDA failed to accurately record and report revenues from the sale of software licenses and certain 
services agreements that were linked to each other.  JDAs failures in these areas were caused by 
inadequate internal controls surrounding revenue recognition.  JDA lacked adequate revenue 
recognition policies and procedures and failed to identify all service-related contracts needed for 
VSOE testing to determine the fair value of certain services. 
 
       Ultimately, in August 2012, JDA restated its financial results for fiscal years 2008 through 
the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, and in its restatement acknowledged, among other things, 
material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting.  By engaging in the foregoing 
conduct, JDA violated the reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the 
federal securities laws, namely Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act 
and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder. 
 
                                        RESPONDENT 
 
       JDA Software Group, Inc. (JDA), a Delaware corporation headquartered in Scottsdale, 
Arizona, is a leading provider of business software solutions for a broad range of industry groups 
ranging from foods, manufacturing, retail, government and defense contracting.  In December 2012, 
JDA was acquired by RedPrairie, a privately held software company for approximately $1.9 billion.  
Both JDA and RedPrairie are owned by New     Mountain Capital, LLC, a private investment 
company.  Prior to its acquisition by RedPrairie, JDAs common stock was registered with the 
Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and traded 
on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.  Since JDA had stock registered under Section 12 of the 
Securities Act, it was required to file reports with the Commission pursuant to Sections 13(a) of the 
Exchange Act.

                                       BACKGROUND 
        
       1.      
               In 1997, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) issued 
Statement of Position 97-2, Software  Revenue Recognition (SOP 97-2), the first industry-
specific GAAP guidance on revenue recognition for software and software-related products.  
Following the issuance of SOP 97-2, the AICPA also released numerous standards and Technical 
Practice Aids (TPAs) clarifying specific aspects of software revenue recognition.   In June 2009, 
existing GAAP pronouncements were codified into the Accounting Standards Codification, 
effective for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009.  SOP 97-2, its related 
amendments and related TPAs were codified at ASC 985-605 (hereinafter ASC 985-605).    

       2.     JDAs business involved selling computer software licenses and services related to 
those software licenses to various customers located throughout the world.  The primary related 
services were: (i) Managed (Hosting/Cloud) Services; (ii) Consulting Services; (iii)  Post Contract 
Customer Support (Maintenance); and (iv) Education/Training.  Managed Services involve  d, 
among other things, JDA hosting the software for customers on JDAs servers.  Consulting 
Services involves assisting customers in all phases of systems implementation, including program 
and project management.   

       3.     JDA sold its software licenses and related services in three ways: (i) it bundled the 
software license and some, if not all, of the related services and sold them as a single contract, 
known as a multiple element arrangement under the accounting literature; (ii) it sold the software 
license and the related services in separate contracts that were linked; or (iii) it sold the software 
license and related services in separate contracts that were not linked.  These services contracts 
were typically offered for a set period of time.    

       4.     As a computer  software company, JDAs ability to recognize revenue from the sale 
of software and related services in a multiple element arrangement was governed broadly by ASC 
985-605.  In order to recognize the full amount of revenue from the sale of a software license 
immediately in the quarter in which the sale occurred, JDA had to establish that it had VSOE for 
each undelivered element of the bundled services.  If JDA  was unable to establish VSOE for any 
undelivered element, it had to recognize revenue from the software license ratably over the term of 
the services agreement.  

        

        

        

        

        

        

                                               3 
---------------------Page 4---------------------

       5.      ASC 985-605 limits the information that a company may use to establish the fair 
value of a particular element.   This information is limited to:  

           a.  The price charged when the same element    is sold separately2
                                                                            ; or 

           b.  For an element not yet being sold separately, the price established by management 
               having the relevant authority; it must be probable that the price, once established, 
               will not change before the separate introduction of the element into the market 
               place (management authority). 

                             VSOE FOR MANAGED SERVICES 
                                                  
       6.      JDA offered Managed Services to its customers.  In fiscal years 2008 and 2009, 
JDA did not conduct any VSOE studies using    stand-alone transactions to determine whether it had 
established VSOE for its Managed Services.  Rather than using   stand-alone transactions, JDA 
relied solely on management authority to establish VSOE for its Managed Services. 

       7.      To establish VSOE using   management authority, a company must demonstrate that 
the actual prices charged for the services in multiple element arrangements conform to the prices 
set by management.  In fiscal years 2008 and 2009, however, JDA did not have adequate    policies 
and procedures to determine whether   the sales prices for Managed Services in its multiple element 
arrangements complied with the prices that were set by JDAs management.  JDA conducted no 
testing to make this determination.  Thus, as part of its restatement process  and specifically with 
regard to Managed Services  JDA determined that it had not established VSOE for Managed 
Services in fiscal years 2008 and 2009 because it did not sell its Managed Services offerings at 
prices that were consistent with prices set by management.  

       8.      For fiscal year 2010, JDA conducted its  first-ever VSOE study for Managed 
Services using stand-alone transactions.  JDA initially identified five stand-alone Managed 
Services transactions and determined that those transactions demonstrated sufficient clustering to 
establish VSOE.  As part of its 2010 annual audit, JDAs auditor determined that one of the 
transactions was not a stand-alone transaction, and JDA concluded that the remaining four were 
sufficient to establish VSOE.   

       9.      As part of the restatement process, however, JDA determined that one of those four 
transactions was not a stand-alone transaction because it was linked to a software license 
agreement.  JDA determined that the remaining three transactions did  not constitute an acceptable 
population by which VSOE for Managed Services could be established     .  In particular,  JDA noted 
that the objective testing populations of stand-alone transactions [the remaining three transactions] 

                                                 
2
       For ease of reference in the Order, we refer to contracts in which services are sold separately as stand-alone 
transactions.  An analysis of stand -alone transactions for VSOE purposes involves:  (i) identifying transactions in 
which a particular service is sold separately (not in a multiple element arrangement); (ii) identifying the actual prices 
at which those services were sold; and (iii) determining whether those prices demonstrate sufficient clustering (i.e. 
prices that are tightly grouped around the average price) to establish VSOE. 
 

                                                 4 
---------------------Page 5---------------------

were not substantial enough to establish VSOE.  Thus, JDA did not properly record revenue from 
the sale of certain software licenses in which Managed Services were a bundled or linked service. 

                           VSOE FOR CONSULTING SERVICES 
                                                 
       10.    During the relevant period, JDA offered C onsulting Services to its customers 
throughout the world, including in Japan, Australia, and Europe.  JDA offered its Consulting 
Services typically through fixed bid contracts or contracts based on a time and material 
arrangements with set hourly rates.   

       11.    In fixed bid contracts, JDA set a fixed total dollar amount for a particular consulting 
arrangement, which was based on an estimate of the number of hours that were expected to be 
spent by the consultants on the project.  During the relevant period  and as they had with 
Managed Services arrangements   in fiscal years 2008 and 2009  JDA did not conduct  VSOE   
testing to determine whether the actual contract rates in fixed bid contracts complied with the 
consulting rates set by management authority. 

       12.    As part of its restatement process, JDA concluded that from fiscal year 2008 through 
fiscal year 2010, JDAs fixed bid contracts lacked consistency in pricing.  In particular, for fixed bid 
contracts in fiscal year 2010, JDA found that it only had a 13% compliance rate, and therefore JDA 
concluded that VSOE for fixed bid contracts did not exist.  

       13.    With respect to consulting services based upon time and material arrangements, 
because consulting and currency rates varied depending on the customers geographic region, JDA 
was required to establish VSOE for Consulting Services on a geographic basis.  JDA, however, did 
not conduct any VSOE analysis for certain geographic regions. 

       14.     During its restatement process, JDA conducted an analysis on a geographic basis 
and determined that for certain regions it did not have a sufficient volume of consulting contracts to 
establish VSOE in certain foreign currencies.   Thus, JDA did not properly record revenue from the 
sale of certain software licenses in which Consulting Services were a bundled or linked service. 

                                   LINKED CONTRACTS 
                                                 
       15.    With respect to services offered in stand-alone arrangements, ASC 985-605-55-4 3
                                                                                                
requires computer software companies to analyze whether the services offered to a customer are 
linked to a software license sold to the same customer. 

       16.    Pursuant to ASC 985-605-55-4, a group of contracts or agreements may be so 
closely related that they are, in effect, parts of a single arrangement.  The form of an arrangement is 
not necessarily the only indicator of the substance of an arrangement. The existence of any of the 
following factors (which are not all-inclusive) may indicate that a group of contracts should be 

                                                 
3
       Prior to the accounting standards codification, TPA 5100.39 provided authoritative 
guidance for the analysis of linked contracts. 

                                               5 
---------------------Page 6---------------------

accounted for as a single arrangement:  (i) the contracts or agreements are negotiated or executed 
within a short timeframe of each other; (ii) the different elements are closely interrelated or 
interdependent in terms of design, technology, or function; (iii) the fee for one or more contracts or 
agreements is subject to refund, forfeiture, or other concession if another contract is not completed 
satisfactorily; (iv) one or more elements in one contract or agreement are essential to the 
functionality of an element in another contract or agreement; (v) payment terms under one contract 
or agreement coincide with performance criteria of another contract or agreement; and (vi) the 
negotiations are conducted jointly with two or more parties (for example, from different divisions 
of the same company) to do what in essence is a single project. 

       17.    Whether contracts are linked has significant implications from a VSOE, and in turn, 
a revenue recognition perspective.  If two contracts are deemed to be linked, they are treated as part 
of a multiple element arrangement.  As noted earlier, software companies are unable to recognize 
the full amount of the license revenue in the quarter in which the revenue is obtained unless they 
have VSOE for each service that is linked to the license agreement.               

       18.    Moreover, if a service contract is linked to a license agreement, that service 
agreement cannot be used as a stand-alone transaction for purposes of establishing VSOE.  In fact, 
as noted above, JDA determined in connection with its restatement that one of the stand-alone 
transactions relied upon in its VSOE study of Managed Services for fiscal year 2010 was linked, 
and therefore, could not be included in a population of stand-alone transactions. 

       19.    During the relevant period, JDAs internal controls and testing for linked contracts 
were deficient.  JDAs controls were not adequately designed to identify all of the service contracts 
that were in the process of being negotiated with customers.  Specifically, JDA did not maintain any 
centralized database to track such contracts.  In addition, JDAs controls were not adequately 
designed to systematically identify  by customer  any services contracts that were signed within a 
defined period of the software license agreement.  Accordingly, JDA was unable to conduct 
adequate testing for linked contracts in compliance with ASC 985-605-55-4. 

       20.    As JDA determined during its restatement process, any linkage analysis that 
occurred was rarely documented.  Accordingly, even in those instances where it appeared that 
linkage was purportedly considered, it was very difficult to determine what if any analysis was done 
or whether the software license was linked to any service due to the lack of documentation. 

       21.    JDAs linkage analysis was largely limited to determining whether an obligation 
existed to deliver services and whether a carve-out from license revenue was necessary where rates 
in a related services agreement were below VSOE, and did not consider all of the other factors set 
forth in ASC 985-605-55-4. 

       22.    Accordingly, JDA did not properly assess contracts for linkage.  Consequently, JDA 
reported a material weakness in its internal controls over financial reporting.

                                   THE RESTATEMENT 

       23.    On August 6, 201 2, JDA restated its financial statements for fiscal years 2008, 2009, 
2010 and the first three quarters of fiscal year 2011.  JDA misstated its revenues, net income and 
other financial metrics in all reporting periods.  In particular, JDA determined in the restatement that 
revenue was not recognized in the correct reporting periods.  Thus, in some reporting periods, 
JDAs financial results were materially overstated and in others they were materially understated.  
The chart below summarizes JDAs material misstatements:

       24.    In the restatement, JDA identified control failures that constituted material 
weaknesses, and a significant deficiency, in its internal controls  over financial reporting   
specifically related to multiple element arrangements and VSOE for certain services . 
Specifically, JDA acknowledged that material weakness existed in its internal controls over the 
application of revenue recognition criteria required by ASC 985-605.  

       25.    JDA noted that the material weakness related to both the insufficient design and 
ineffective operation of certain internal controls over the identification of license agreements 
linked to consulting agreements and Managed Services, as well as testing and documentation of 
VSOE for Managed Services and   Consulting Services products.

                                        VIOLATIONS 

       26.    Under Section 21C of the Exchange Act, the Commission may impose a cease-and-
desist order upon any person who is violating, has violated, or is about to violate any provision of 
the Act and upon any other person that is, was, or would be a cause of the violation, due to an act 
or omission the person knew or should have known would contribute to such violation.   

       27.    Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act requires issuers to file such periodic and other 
reports as the Commission may prescribe and in conformity with such rules as the Commission may 
promulgate.  Exchange Act Rules 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 require the filing of annual, current, 
and quarterly reports, respectively.  In addition to the information expressly required to be included 
in such reports, Rule 12b-20 of the Exchange Act requires issuers to add such further material 
information, if any, as may be necessary to make the required statements, in the light of the 
circumstances under which they are made not misleading.  The reporting provisions of the 
Exchange Act are clear and unequivocal, and they are satisfied only by the filing of complete, 
accurate, and timely reports.  SEC v. Savoy Industries, 587 F.2d 1149, 1165 (D.C. Cir. 1978) 
(citing SEC v. IMC Intl, Inc., 384 F. Supp. 889, 893 (N.D. Tex. 1974)).  A violation of the reporting 
provisions is established if a report is shown to contain materially false or misleading information. 
SEC v. Kalvex, Inc., 425 F. Supp. 310, 316 (S.D.N.Y. 1975).                    

       28.    Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act requires issuers to make and keep books, 
records, and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and 
dispositions of the assets of the issuer.  Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act requires issuers to 
devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable 
assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial 
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.   

       29.    By engaging in the conduct above, JDA violated Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act 
and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder, and Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) 
of the Exchange Act.  

       30.    In determining to accept Respondents Offer, the Commission considered remedial 
acts undertaken by JDA, including its enhancement of internal controls, retention of additional 
accounting personnel, and JDAs cooperation with the staffs investigation. 

                                              IV. 
                                                 
       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in Respondents Offer. 
 
       Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that: 
 
       A.     Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Respondent   cease and desist from 
committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Section 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 
13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder.
