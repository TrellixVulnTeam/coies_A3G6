                                             I.  
 
       The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the 
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against Stephen 
Durland (“Durland” or “Respondent”) pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3) of the  Commission’s Rules of 
Practice.1

 Rule 102(e)(3)(i) provides, in relevant part, that: 
 
       The Commission, with due regard to the public interest and without preliminary hearing, 
may, by order, . . . suspend from appearing or practicing before it any . . . accountant . . . who has 
been by name . . . permanently enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction, by reason of his 
or her misconduct in an action brought by the Commission, from violating or aiding and abetting 
the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or of the rules and regulations 
thereunder.

                                              II.  
 
       The Commission finds that:  
 
A. RESPONDENT 
        
       1.     Durland, age 56, resides in West Pa lm Beach, Florida, and has been CFO of 
Pegasus Wireless Corporation (“Pegasus”) since 2005.  He is a CPA currently licensed in New 
York.  His firm, Durland & Company, CPAs, P.A., has performed auditing work for several 
microcap companies.  The firm was registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight 
Board (“PCAOB”), but is no longer.  During the staff’s investigation of Pegasus, Respondent  
refused to answer the staff’s questions in testimony based on his Fifth Amendment privilege 
against self-incrimination. 
        
B. CIVIL INJUNCTION 
 
       3.     On May 27, 2009, the Commission filed a complaint against Durland in SEC v. 
Pegasus Wireless Corp. (Civil Action No. CV 09-2302) in the United States District Court for the  
Northern District of California.  On September 28, 2010, the court entered a judgment against 
Durland permanently enjoining him from future violations, direct or indirect, of Sections 5(a), 5(c), 
and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 13(b)(5), and 16(a) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1, 13b2-2 and 16a-3 thereunder and from 
aiding and abetting violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-
11 and 13a-13 thereunder. 
 
       4.     The Commission’s complain   t alleged, among other things, that Durland and another  
Pegasus officer defrauded investors by creating backdated promissory notes memorializing a 
phony debt, which they used to get unrestricted shares of Pegasus stock into the hands of 
individuals and entities they controlled.  Durland caused Pegasus to issue nearly 480 million shares 
– 75% of its outstanding shares – based on the fake, backdated promissory notes, resulting in 
massive dilution of the existing shareholders’ ownership interest.  The individuals and entities who 
received shares dumped the stock on the open market and funneled many millions in proceeds to 
Durland and the other Pegasus officer.  Durland also made numerous misrepresentations and 
omissions in SEC filings about Pegasus’ financing for acquisitions.  
 
                                              III. 
                                                 
       Based upon the foregoing, the Commission finds that a court of competent jurisdiction 
has permanently enjoined Durland, a CPA, from viol                                                 ating the federal securities laws within the 
meaning of Rule  102(e)(3)(i)(A) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice.  In view of these 
findings, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest that Durland be 
temporarily suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission.

        IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Durland be, and hereby is, temporarily suspended from 
appearing or practicing before the Commission.  This Order shall be effective upon service on 
the Respondent. 
 
        IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Durland may within thirty days after service of this 
Order file a petition with the Commission to lift the temporary suspension.  If the Commission 
within thirty days after service of the Order receives no petition, the suspension shall become  
permanent pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(ii). 
 
        If a petition is received within thirty days after service of this Order, the Commission 
shall, within thirty days after the filing of the petition, either lift the temporary suspension, or set 
the matter down for hearing at a time and place to be designated by the Commission, or both.  If 
a hearing is ordered, following the hearing, the Commission may lift the suspension, censure the 
petitioner, or disqualify the petitioner from appearing or practicing before the Commission for a 
period of time, or  permanently, pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(iii). 
 
        This Order shall be served upon Durland personally or by certified mail at his last 
known address.

       Secretary
