                                                III. 
 
              On the basis of this Order and Respondents Offer, the Commission finds1
                                                                                     that: 
 
                                       A. Respondents 
 
              1.           Greentech is a Florida corporation headquartered in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.  
During the time period relevant here, Greentech, a company engaged in the sale, marketing and 
rental of portable trade show displays, had a class of securities registered with the Commission 
under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act that were traded on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin 
Board.   
 
              2.           Roland L. Breton is the president, CEO and a director of Greentech.  Breton has 
no known disciplinary history and is not an officer or director of any other publicly traded 
company.       
 
                                       B. Background 
 
              3.           On October 14, 2003, Greentech filed a Form S-8 regarding the issuance of 15.6 
million shares to several consultants for various services.  Greentechs Form S-8 incorporated by 
reference subsequent filings of Greentech until such time as a post-effective amendment to the S-
8 is filed disclosing that all securities offered have been sold or which de-registers all securities 
that remain unsold.  No such amendment was filed during the time period re    levant to the events 
described herein.  Therefore, the Form S-8 incorporated the filings described below. 
 
              4.           On April 16, 2004, Greentech filed with the Commission a Form 10-KSB for the 
year ended December 31, 2003.  The Form 10-KSB was signed and certified by Breton, as 
Greentechs CEO and principal accounting and financial officer.  Greentech relied on a non-
employee management consultant, Marvin Winick, to prepare and then file the companys public 
reports.  Prior to filing, Winick was to provide draft reports for review by Breton. Winick 
prepared the Form 10-KSB for Greentech and included in the filing an audit report, dated April 
15, 2004, purportedly provided by an Oklahoma City-based accounting firm (accounting firm) 
and auditors consent letter, purportedly signed by the accounting firm.  In addition, Greentechs 
Form 10-KSB noted that, on December 1, 2003, the company retained the accounting firm to 
replace its prior auditor, who had resigned.   
 
              5.           On May 19, 2004, August 19, 2004 and November 26, 2004, Greentech filed 
Forms 10-QSB for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2004, June 30, 2004 and September 
30, 2004, respectively.  All of Greentechs 2004 quarterly filings were signed and certified by 
Breton, as CEO and principal financial and accounting officer.  Each filing contains a balance 
sheet comparing the financial results for the current quarter with those for the year ended 
December 31, 2003 and designating the 2003 period as audited.

               The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondents Offer of Settlement and are not binding on any 
other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

       6.           In October 2004, the managing partner (auditor) of the accounting firm learned 
that Greentechs Form 10-KSB contained the accounting firms purported audit report.  In fact, 
the accounting firm neither audited Greentech nor provided Greentech with an audit report.  The 
auditor immediately confronted Winick about the fictitious audit report. Winick admitted to the 
auditor  that he had included the accounting firms audit report in Greentechs Commission 
filing.  The auditor then told Winick to remove the sham report from the filing; Winick assured 
the auditor that he would take care of it. 
 
       7.           In a letter dated October 19, 2004, the accounting firm notified Greentech and 
Winick that the firm had not performed the audit referenced in the 2003 Form 10-KSB and 
demanded that the firms name be removed as Greentechs auditor of record.  Greentech took no 
steps until February 2005 to advise the investing public, in a Form 8-K, press release or by any 
other means, that the accounting firm performed no audit of its financial statements.  
                                                  
                                     C. Legal Standards 
 
       8.           Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act proscribe certain fraudulent 
conduct in the offer and sale of securities.  Specifically, Section 17(a)(2) makes it unlawful, in 
the offer or sale of any securities, for any person to obtain money or property by means of any 
untrue statement of a material fact or any omission to state a material fact necessary in order to 
make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not 
misleading.  Similarly, Section 17(a)(3) makes it unlawful, in the offer or sale of any securities, 
to engage in any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates as a fraud or deceit 
upon the purchaser.  Scienter is not required to establish a violation of Section 17(a)(2) or (3).  In 
this case, Greentechs Form S-8, described above, was a continuing offer of the sale of securities 
throughout the relevant time period. 
                
       9.           Sections 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder require issuers with a class 
of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act to file with the Commission annual 
and periodic reports, and Rule 12b-20 of the Exchange Act requires that periodic reports contain 
all information necessary to ensure that the statements made in them are not materially 
misleading.  It is implicit in these requirements that the information in the reports be accurate.  
See SEC v. Savoy Indus., Inc., 587 F.2d 1149, 1165 (D.C. Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 913 
(1979).   
                
              10.        Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act requires issuers to make and keep 
books, records, and accounts that, in reasonable detail, accurately reflect transactions and asset 
dispositions, and Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act requires issuers to devise and 
maintain a system of internal controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in 
accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.   
 
              11.        Rule 13b2-1 (promulgated under Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act) 
prohibits any person from, directly or indirectly, falsifying or causing to be falsified any book, 
record or account subject to Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act.

              12.        Exchange Act Rule 13a-14 requires principal executives and financial officers to 
certify in quarterly and annual Commission filings that, among other things, they have read the 
filing; that it does not contain any untrue statements, or omissions, of material facts; that the 
filing fairly presents the financial condition and results of operations and cash flows of the 
issuer; and that they have disclosed to the audit committee and auditors all significant 
deficiencies of internal controls of the company.  Rule 13a-14 further requires certifying officers 
to certify that they have, among other things, reviewed the issuers internal controls. 
                
                                       D. Conclusions 
 
              13.        As a result of the conduct described above, Greentech violated Sections 17(a)(2) 
and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act, and Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the 
Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder. 
 
       14.        As a result of the conduct described above, Breton violated Sections 17(a)(2) and 
17(a)(3) of the Securities Act and Rules 13a-14 and 13b2-1 of the Exchange Act, and caused 
Greentechs violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and 
Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder.

              In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanction 
agreed to in Respondents Offers.  
 
         Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that: 
 
         Respondent Greentech cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and 
any future violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act and Sections 13(a), 
13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 
thereunder.  
 
         Respondent Breton cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any 
future violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act and Rules 13a-14 and 
13b2-1 of the Exchange Act, and from causing any violations and any future violations of 
Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 
13a-13 thereunder. 
 
              By the Commission.
