                                              II.  
 
       In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the 
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings  
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these 
proceedings, and the findings contained in Section III.1 and 3  below, which are admitted, 
Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Public Administrative Proceedings 
Pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing 
Remedial Sanctions (“Order”), as set forth below.   
 
                                              III.  
 
       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that:  
 
              1.      Wiseman, age 49, was  the chief financial officer  of Chesapeake Display &  
Packaging (“CD&P”), a subsidiary of Chesapeake Corporation (“Chesapeake”), from 1998 through 
November 2000.  He  is a certified public accountant in Georgia and Florida, but his license in each 
State has been inactive since 1989 and 1990, respectively. 
        
              2.      CD&P was at all relevant times a subsidiary of Chesapeake Corporation, a 
corporation incorporated and headquartered in Virginia.  CD&P designed and manufactured 
specialty-packaging products, including point-of-purchase displays.  At all relevant times, 
Chesapeake’s common stock was registered with  the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), and traded on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 
              3.      On August 22, 2005, in an action brought by the Commission captioned 
SEC      v. Chesapeake Corporation, et al., Civ. Action No.  1:05CV00872 (D.D.C.), the United  
States District Court for the  District of Columbia entered a final judgment permanently enjoining 
Wiseman from future violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules  
10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 
13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder.  
        
              4.      The Commission’s complaint alleged, among other things, that Wiseman 

 engaged in fraudulent acts which resulted in Chesapeake filing materially false and misleading 

 financial statements on its Form 10-Q for the first two quarters of 2000. The complaint alleged 

 that Wiseman engaged in a number of improper accounting practices that materially increased 

 Chesapeake’s quarterly earnings and net income in a departure from generally accepted 

 accounting principles, namely improperly recording credit memos and improperly recording 

 receivables.  The complaint further alleged that Wiseman authorized false journal entries in 

 CD&P’s books and records for the third quarter of 2000, which were ultimately discovered and 
 
 corrected before Chesapeake issued its third quarter financial statements.

            In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
impose the sanction agreed to in Respondent Wiseman’s Offer. 
 
            Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that:  
 
            Wiseman is suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an 
accountant. 
 
 By the Commission.

       Secretary                                                                                     

                                                                              3
