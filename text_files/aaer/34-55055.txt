                                                          I. 
 
              The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) deems it appropriate and in the 
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against Cary B. 
Griswold (Respondent or Griswold) pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(i) of the Commissions Rules 
of Practice. 1

 Rule 102(e)(3)(i) provides, in relevant part, that: 
 
              The Commission, with due regard to the public interest and without preliminary hearing, 
may, by order, . . . suspend from appearing or practicing before it any . . . accountant . . . who has 
been by name . . . permanently enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction, by reason of his 
or her misconduct in an action brought by the Commission, from violating or aiding and abetting 
the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or of the rules and regulations 
thereunder.

                                               II. 
 
              In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the Offer) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the 
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings 
herein, except as to the Commissions jurisdiction over her and the subject matter of these 
proceedings, and the findings contained in Section III.C. below, which are admitted, Respondent 
consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Rule 102(e) 
of the Commissions Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions 
(Order), as set forth below.   
 
                                               III. 
 
              On the basis of this Order and Respondents Offer, the Commission finds that:  
 
       A.          Griswold, age 29, obtained her certificate as a certified public accountant in March 
2001, and obtained her permit to practice in the state of South Dakota on July 1, 2002.  She served 
as the primary staff accountant for Northwestern Communications Solutions (NCS), an operating 
division of a subsidiary of Northwestern Corporation (Northwestern), from April 2001 until 
August 2003.   
        
       B.          Northwestern was, at all relevant times, a Delaware corporation with its principal 
place of business in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.  Northwestern, through a wholly owned former 
subsidiary, operated a public utility business serving the Upper Midwest region.  At all relevant 
times, Northwesterns common stock was registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) 
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and traded on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
 
       C.          On December 14, 2006 a final judgment was entered against Respondent, 
permanently enjoining her from future violations of Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 
13b2-1 thereunder, and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 
13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder, in the 
civil action entitled Securities and Exchange Commission v. Bart A. Thielbar et al., Civil Action 
Number 06-4253 in the United States District Court for the District of South Dakota.   
 
              D.          The Commissions Complaint alleged, among other things, that Respondent, at the 
 direction of her supervisors, participated in misstating the financial statements of NCS.  After 
 consolidation, these misstatements resulted in Northwestern materially overstating its income or 
 materially understating its loss in its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended 
 December 31, 2001, and in its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the first two quarters of fiscal 
 year 2002.  The Complaint alleged that the Respondent improperly reclassified unsubstantiated 
 assets to goodwill rather than making appropriate charges to the income statement.  In addition, 
 the Complaint alleged that Respondent improperly recorded revenue for transactions before 

                                                2 
---------------------Page 3---------------------

 NCS had arrangements with customers, and recorded revenue prematurely before the revenue 
 was earned. 
  
                                                 IV. 
                                                    
        In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
impose the sanction agreed to in Respondents Offer. 
 
        Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that: 
 
              A.          Respondent is suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an 
accountant.   
 
              B.          After two years from the date of this order, Respondent may request that the 
Commission consider her reinstatement by submitting an application (attention: Office of the 
Chief Accountant) to resume appearing or practicing before the Commission as: 
      
                           1.           a preparer or reviewer, or a person responsible for the preparation or 
review, of any public companys financial statements that are filed with the Commission.  Such 
an application must satisfy the Commission that Respondents work in her practice before the 
Commission will be reviewed either by the independent audit committee of the public company 
for which she works or in some other acceptable manner, as long as she practices before the 
Commission in this capacity; and/or 
      
                            2.          an independent accountant.  Such an application must satisfy the 
Commission that: 
      
                                         (a)         Respondent, or the public accounting firm with which she is 
associated, is registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (Board) in 
accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and such registration continues to be effective; 
 
   (b) Respondent, or the register                          ed public accounting firm with which 
she is associated, has been inspected by the Board and that inspection did not identify any 
criticisms of or potential defects in the respondents or the firms quality control system that 
would indicate that the respondent will not receive appropriate supervision. 

   (c) Respondent has resolved all di                          sciplinary issues with the Board, and 
has complied with all terms and conditions of any sanctions imposed by the Board (other than 
reinstatement by the Commission); and 
 
   (d) Respondent acknowledges                              her responsibility, as long as 
Respondent appears or practices before the Commission as an independent accountant, to 
comply with all requirements of the Commission and the Board, including, but not limited to, all 
requirements relating to registration, inspections, concurring partner reviews and quality control 
standards.   
 
                                                  3 
---------------------Page 4---------------------

      
         C.       The Commission will consider an application by Respondent to resume 
appearing or practicing before the Commission provided that her state CPA license is 
current and she has resolved all other disciplinary issues with the applicable state boards of 
accountancy.  However, if state licensure is dependent on reinstatement by the 
Commission, the Commission will consider an application on its other merits.  The 
Commissions review may include consideration of, in addition to the matters referenced 
above, any other matters relating to Respondents character, integrity, professional conduct, 
or qualifications to appear or practice before the Commission. 
 
 By the Commission.
