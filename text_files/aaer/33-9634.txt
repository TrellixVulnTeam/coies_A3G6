      The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) deems it appropriate that public 
administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 
8A of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 21C of the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) against AirTouch Communications, Inc., Hideyuki Kanakubo, and 
Jerome Kaiser, CPA (collectively, Respondents), and additionally as to Kaiser, pursuant to 
Section 4C of the Exchange Act and Rule 102(e)(1)(iii) of the Commissions Rules of Practice. 

                                        II. 

      After an investigation, the Division of Enforcement alleges that: 

      A.    SUMMARY 

            1.     This matter involves fraudulent financial disclosures and omissions by 
AirTouch Communications, Inc. (AirTouch), a Newport Beach, California issuer, its founder and 
former president and CEO Hideyuki Kanakubo (Kanakubo) , and its former CFO and corporate 
---------------------Page 2---------------------

secretary Jerome Kaiser, CPA  (Kaiser), in the companys voluntarily filed Form 10-Q for the 
third quarter of 2012, and in fraudulent statements and omissions to an investor   in connection with 
a $2 million loan made to the company in the fall of 2012.   

              2.     In the third quarter of 2012, AirTouch improperly recognized net revenues 
of $1.031 million based on $1.24 million of inventory shipped to a Florida entity.  This revenue 
recognition was improper because, as both Kanakubo and Kaiser knew, or were reckless in not 
knowing, a fulfillment and logistics agreement executed contemporaneously with the Florida 
entitys purchase orderand upon which the purchase order was conditioned relieved that entity 
of any obligation to pay AirTouch unless and until an AirTouch customer purchased the inventory.  
Kanakubo and Kaiser also knowingly, recklessly or negligently made false representations and 
omissions about this revenue to an AirTouch   investor and lender.  Their conduct in inflating the 
revenues and obtaining financing was also deceptive and constituted a scheme to defraud.  

              3.     In early 2013, AirTouch filed a Form 8-K disclosing its intention to restate 
net revenues for the third quarter of 2012, based on erroneous revenue recognition.   

       B.     RESPONDENTS 

              4.     AirTouch Communications, Inc. is a Delaware corporation with its 
principal place of business in Newport Beach, California.  AirTouchs common stock is quoted on 
the OTC Pinks  under the symbol ATCH.   AirTouch develops and sells telecommunications 
equipment designed to integrate mobile telephones into landline telephone systems within a 
consumers home.   

              5.      Hideyuki Kanakubo resid es in Irvine, California.  He is AirTouchs 
founder and former president, CEO, director, and chief technology officer.  At all relevant times, 
Kanakubo was responsible for the management of AirTouchs business.  As of May 31, 2014, 
Kanakubo beneficially owned or controlled 1,858,143 shares of AirTouch common stock, or 9% of 
the companys total outstanding shares.  Kanakubo resigned as president and CEO in March 2013.  
He resigned as chief technology officer in April 2013. 

              6.     Jerome Kaiser, CPA               resides in Chowchilla, California.  Kaiser is a 
licensed Certified Public Accountant and an active member in the AICPA and California Society 
of Public Accountants.  Kaiser holds a BS in Accounting and an MS in Business Taxation.  He is 
AirTouchs former CFO and corporate s ecretary.  At all relevant times, Kaiser was responsible for 
the management of AirTouchs business.  As of May 31, 2014, Kaiser owned options to acquire 
520,096 shares of AirTouch common stock at a strike price of $2 per share.   He resigned from 
AirTouch in April 2013. 

       C.     FACTUAL BACKGROUND 

              7.     In or around early 2012, AirTouch developed a new product, the U250 
SmartLinx, designed for sale to Mexicos largest provider of landline telephone services (the 
Mexican Entity).     

              8.     On July 30, 2012, AirTouch contacted a Florida provider of logistics and 
fulfillment services (the Florida Entity) about the possibility of warehousing AirTouchs U250 

                                              2 
---------------------Page 3---------------------

SmartLinx product for possible sale to the Mexican Entity.  AirTouch had never done business 
with the Florida Entity prior to July 30, 2012. 

              9.      During contract negotiations related to this potential warehousing 
arrangement, the Florida Entitys CEO told Kanakubo that the Florida Entity was not buying any 
product from AirTouch, but rather would only warehouse  the U250 SmartLinx inventory for 
eventual delivery to the Mexican Entity or other customers of AirTouch.  AirTouchs salesperson 
relayed the same information to Kaiser.   

              10.     On July 30, 2012, Kaiser sent Kanakubo a Fulfillment and Logistics 
Agreement between AirTouch and the Florida Entity (the Agreement), asking him to 
immediately review and sign it, which Kanakubo did.  The Agreement included, among other 
terms, the following provisions:    

       a)     Section 3 (Orders and Acceptance):  [The Florida Entity]s purchase orders are 
              subject to purchase orders by [the Mexican Entity] and/or any other customer that 
              may be assigned from time to time by AirTouch.  In the event [the Mexican Entity] 
              or any of the customers does not fulfill the purchase orders and/or cancels the 
              orders, [the Florida Entity] shall have the right to return these products to AirTouch 
              and obtain a full credit equal to the original purchase amount with no offsets or 
              deductions or any kind.; 

       b)     Section 5 (Resale to [the Mexican Entity] and/or Assigned Customers by 
              AirTouch):  [The Florida Entity] shall store the merchandise until shipment of the 
              Products and shall invoice AirTouch for storage of the products, in/out control, 
              invoicing, stock reconciliation, at 1.5% of the invoice value for the first 30 days and 
              an additional 1% for each additional 30 days.; and 

       c)     Section 6 (Payment):  [The Florida Entity] shall pay for Products in 90 days in 
              accordance with the payment terms invoiced by AirTouch.  However, [the Florida 
              Entity] shall not be obligated to pay AirTouch until the Products have been received 
              by [the Mexican Entity] and [the Florida Entity] has received full payment therefor, 
              at which time then [the Florida Entity] shall pay AirTouch for the Products within 
              10 days thereafter. 

              11.     The same day, the Florida Entity issued a $1.74 million purchase order 
for 20,000 U250 SmartLinx (the Purchase Order).  The Purchase Order stated a payment term of 
Net 90 but also stated that its payment terms were according to term sheet.   The Agreement 
was the term sheet.  Kaiser received emails where representatives of the Florida Entity described 
the Purchase Order as conditional upon AirTouchs execution of the Agreement.  Kanakubo was 
also made aware that the Florida Entity would not issue the Purchase Order unless AirTouch first 
executed the Agreement. 

              12.     On July 31, 2012, the Florida Entity sent Kaiser the counter-signed 
Agreement and the Purchase Order in a single email.   Before forwarding this email to AirTouchs 
controller, he deleted the Agreement as an attachment, and forwarded only the Purchase Order. 

                                               3 
---------------------Page 4---------------------

              13.    AirTouch shipped approximately $1.24 million of  inventory to the Florida 
Entity during the third quarter of 2012, pursuant to the Agreement and the Purchase Order.  
AirTouch recognized revenue on all $1.24 million of inventory shipped to the Florida Entity during 
the quarter. 

              14.    In October 2012, in connection with AirTouchs quarterly review, 
AirTouchs controller provided its outside independent accountant with a copy of the Purchase 
Order, but not the Agreement.  The outside independent accountant did not receive the Agreement 
since Kaiser had never provided AirTouchs controller with the Agreement. 

              15.    When discussing the purported receivable AirTouch booked from the 
Florida Entity at board meetings, Kanakubo and Kaiser did not inform AirTouchs outside 
directors, including the chairman of the audit committee, that shipments to the Florida Entity were 
controlled by the Agreement.  

              16.    AirTouch did not receive any payment from the Florida Entity during the 
third quarter of 2012, and likewise received no commitment from the Mexican Entity that it would 
buy product shipped to the Florida Entity, or otherwise.  

              1.   AirTouch, Kanakubo and Kaiser Made False and Misleading Statements 
              and Engaged in a Scheme to Defraud and Deceptive Conduct Concerning 
              Revenue Recognition    in AirTouchs Form 10-  Q for the Third Quarter 2012  

              17.    On November 14, 2012, AirTouch filed its Form 10-Q for the third quarter 
of 2012, reporting net revenues of $1,031,747.  Without the revenue recognized on the inventory 
shipped to the Florida Entity, AirTouch would not have had any positive revenue for the quarter.   

              18.    Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), revenue 
cannot be recognized unless it is realized or realizable and earned.   

              19.    AirTouchs recognition of revenues for the inventory shipped to the Florida 
Entity did not comply with GAAP.  Because AirTouch did not sell any product to the Florida 
Entitythe Purchase Order and the Agreement merely documented , for tracking purposes, the 
transfer of AirTouch inventory to the Florida Entity in contemplation of future salesthe revenue 
associated with shipments to the Florida Entity was not realized, realizable or earned.   

              20.    AirTouchs revenue recognition policy, which was disclosed in the 10-Q 
and was consistent with the requirements of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, permitted 
the recognition of revenue only where :  (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists in the 
form of an accepted purchase order or equivalent documentation; (2) delivery has occurred, based 
on shipping terms, or services have been provided; (3) the companys price to the buyer is fixed or 
determinable, as documented on the accepted purchase order or similar documentation; and (4) 
collectability is reasonably assured. 

              21.    Given the terms of the Purchase Order and the Agreement, AirTouch had no 
reasonable assurance of collectability from the Florida Entity because AirTouch did not even have 
a valid receivable to collect from the Florida Entity.     

                                              4 
---------------------Page 5---------------------

              22.    Kanakubo and Kaiser signed certifications intended to be made pursuant to 
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, stating that the Form 10-Q fairly presented AirTouchs financial 
condition and results.     

              23.    Kanakubo and Kaiser knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that 
AirTouchs Form 10- Q contained materially false or misleading statements concerning reported 
net revenues and compliance with GAAP or AirTouchs revenue recognition policy .   

              24.    The false and misleading statements in AirTouchs Form 10-Q occurred in 
connection with the purchase or sale of securities. 

              25.    The false and misleading statements in AirTouchs Form 10-Q were 
material.  These statements would have been viewed by a reasonable investor as significantly 
altering the total mix of available information, given that AirTouch would not have had any 
positive revenues for the quarter if it did not recognize the revenue from the Florida Entity.  The 
Form 10-Q also reflected AirTouchs largest revenues ever reported for a quarter.   

              26.    Kanakubo and Kaiser each knew about the Agreement    but concealed it from 
others involved in AirTouchs financial reporting process, including the controller, the chairman of 
the audit committee, and the companys outside independent accountant.  These acts of 
concealment, along with other deceptive conduct, contributed to a revenue recognition scheme and 
operated as a fraud.  

              27.    Because of Kanakubos and Kaisers positions as AirTouchs senior 
management, their scienter is attributable to AirTouch. 

              28.    At all relevant times, Kanakubo and Kaiser were the companys principal 
officers; they were the members of management in charge of AirTouchs day-to-day management, 
policies, and operations; and they were responsible for preparing and signing AirTouchs SEC 
filings.   

              2.  Kanakubo and Kaiser Made False and Misleading Statements and 
              Omissions to an Investor and Engaged in a Scheme to Defraud and Deceptive 
              Conduct Concerning Revenues from the Florida Entity        

              29.    In or around 2012, Kanakubo and Kaiser solicited a short term bridge loan 
from an existing AirTouch investor (Investor A), in exchange for a promissory note and a 
warrant to purchase 100,000 shares of AirTouch common stock.  Investor A  recommended the 
loan and warrant acquisition opportunity to a related entity, for which he served as the authorized 
agent during the due diligence process.   

              30.    On October 3, 2012, Kanakubo falsely told Investor A by email that the 
inventory to be shipped by AirTouch to the Florida Entitywhich he mischaracterized as an 
authorized fulfillment house for the Mexican Entitypertained to an existing purchase order 
from the Mexican Entity.    

              31.    Around the same time, Kaiser provided Investor As representatives with 
the Purchase Order, but did not provide them with or disclose the existence of the Agreement. 

                                              5 
---------------------Page 6---------------------

              32.     On October 17, 2012, AirTouch received the loan of $2 million from 
Investor A in exchange for a warrant to purchase its common stock.    

              33.     Two days later, on October 19, 2012, Kanakubo approved a $15,000 bonus 
payment to Kaiser for his work on raising capital.  The same day, Kanakubo authorized a $15,000 
payment to himself in connection with unused vacation time.    

              34.     Kanakubo and Kaiser knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that their 
statements to Investor A concerning revenues from the Florida Entity were materially false and 
misleading.   

              35.     Kanakubo and Kaiser also  failed to act with reasonable care because:   
(1) they did not ensur e that Investor A was provided with all material information necessary to 
make their statements to him concerning the inventory shipped to the Florida Entity not 
misleading; and (2) they provided Investor As representatives with the Purchase Order but not the 
Agreement. 

              36.     The false and misleading statements and omissions to Investor A occurred 
in the offer or sale of, and in connection with the purchase or sale of, securities. 

              37.     Kanakubos and Kaisers false and misleading statements to Investor A, and 
their failure to disclose the terms of the Agreement, were material.  Kanakubos and Kaisers  
statements to Investor A, and the terms of the Agreement, would have been viewed by a reasonable 
investor as significantly altering the total mix of available information because, among other 
reasons, AirTouch had not sold any of the inventory warehoused with the Florida Entity to the 
Mexican Entity, and thus had no basis to represent that it expected to collect revenue from the 
Florida Entity.   

              38.     Kanakubo and Kaiser lured Investor A over several months into loaning 
AirTouch $2 million based on a distorted view of AirTouchs finances and relationships with third 
parties, including the Mexican Entity and the Florida Entity.  They led  Investor A to believe that 
AirTouch would receive a substantial financial commitment from the Mexican Entity, which 
would then provide AirTouch with sufficient cash flow for AirTouch to service and repay the loan.  
These inducements by Kanakubo and Kaiser, along with other deceptive conduct, contributed to an 
offering fraud scheme and a fraudulent transaction.   

              39.     Because of Kanakubos and Kaisers positions as AirTouchs senior 
management, their scienter and their negligence are attributable to AirTouch. 

              40.     At all relevant times, Kanakubo and Kaiser were the companys principal 
officers; they were the members of management in charge of AirTouchs day-to-day management, 
policies, and operations; and they were responsible for negotiating with Investor A, providing 
Investor A with due diligence materials, and for preparing and signing AirTouchs SEC filings.   

              3.  AirTouch Announces It Will Restate Revenues  

              41.     In January 2013, AirTouchs board of directors commenced an internal 
investigation concerning the net revenues reported in the Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2012.    

                                               6 
---------------------Page 7---------------------

              42.     At this time, Kaiser provided the chairman of  the audit committee with the 
Purchase Order, but withheld the Agreement. 

              43.     AirTouchs board of directors and its outside auditor subsequently received 
the Agreement, and determined to restate reported revenues for the third quarter of 2012. 

              44.     AirTouch filed a Form 8-K on February 7, 2013, announcing errors in 
revenue recognition and the intention to file an amended Form 10-Q.  No amended Form 10-Q has 
been filed. 

       E.     VIOLATIONS 

              45.     As a result of the conduct described above, Respondents AirTouch and 
Kanakubo violated, and Kaiser willfully violated, Sections 17(a)  of the Securities Act, and Section 
10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, which prohibit fraudulent conduct in the 
offer and sale of securities and in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.   

              46.     Respondents Kanakubo and Kaiser are jointly and severally  liable under 
Section 8A(a) of the Securities Act for causing AirTouchs violations of Section 17(a) of the 
Securities Act and under Section 21C(a) of the Exchange Act for causing AirTouchs violations of 
Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and in the case of Kaiser, for 
willfully aiding and abetting AirTouchs violations of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.  

                                              III. 

       In view of the allegations made by the Division of Enforcement, the Commission deems it 
appropriate in the public interest that public administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings be 
instituted to determine: 

       A.     Whether the allegations set forth in Section II hereof are true and, in connection 
therewith, to afford Respondents an opportunity to establish any defenses to such allegations;  

       B.     Whether, pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act and Section 21C of the 
Exchange Act, Respondents should be ordered to cease and desist from committing or causing 
violations of and any future violations of Sections 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b)  of 
the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, whether Respondents should be ordered to pay a civil 
penalty pursuant to Section 8A(g) of the Securities Act, in the public interest, and Section 21B(a) of 
the Exchange Act; whether Respondents should be ordered to pay disgorgement pursuant to Section 
8A(e) of the Securities Act and Sections 21B(e) and 21C(e) of the Exchange Act; and whether other 
appropriate relief should be granted, including a prohibition from service as an officer or director of 
any issuer pursuant to Section 8A(f) of the Securities Act and Section 21C(f) of the Exchange Act; 
and  

       C.     Whether, pursuant to Section 4C of the Exchange Act and Rule 102(e)(1)(iii) of the 
Commissions Rules of Practice, it is appropriate to censure or deny Kaiser the privilege of 
appearing or practicing before the Commission. 

                                               7

                                               IV. 

       IT IS ORDERED that a public hearing for the purpose of taking evidence on the questions 
set forth in Section III hereof shall be convened not earlier than 30 days and not later than 60 days 
from service of this Order at a time and place to be fixed, and before an Administrative Law Judge 
to be designated by further order as provided by Rule 110 of the Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 
C.F.R. § 201.110.  

       IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondents shall file an Answer to the allegations 
contained in this Order within twenty (20) days after service of this Order, as provided by Rule 220
