A. RESPONDENT 
 
              Andrew M. Smith, CPA, age 58, of Los Angeles, California, is a certified public 
accountant licensed in the state of California since 1972, doing business as a sole proprietorship.  
Smith audited Safe Travel Care, Inc.s, Meridian Holdings, Inc.s, and InterCare DX, Inc.s 
financial statements for each companys respective 2003 fiscal year ended December 31, 2003.

                                                 2

              3.           InterCare DX, Inc. (InterCare) is a California corporation based in Los Angeles, 
California.  InterCares common stock trades on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol 
ICCO.OB and is registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act.  
The company reported no revenue and total assets of $1.5 million for fiscal year ended December 
31, 2003.  
 
              4.           Safe Travel, Meridian, and InterCare, each, has at all relevant times been an issuer 
as defined by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Act). 
 
              5.           Smith audited Safe Travels 2003 financial statements included in Safe Travels 
annual report for fiscal year 2003 on Form 10-KSB, filed with the Commission on May 6, 2004.  
As part of that audit, Smith prepared and issued an audit report dated February 20, 2004 (the Safe 
Travel audit report), which the company included in its 2003 Form 10-KSB.  Smith audited 
Meridians 2003 financial statements included in Meridians annual report for fiscal year 2003 on 
Form 10-KSB, filed with the Commission on April 1, 2004.  As part of that audit, Smith prepared 
and issued an audit report dated March 31, 2004 (the Meridian audit report), which the company 
included in its 2003 Form 10-KSB.  Smith audited InterCares  2003 financial statements included 
in InterCares annual report for fiscal year 2003 on Form 10-KSB, filed with the Commission on 
March 31, 2004.  As part of that audit, Smith prepared and issued an audit report, also dated March 
31, 2004 (the InterCare audit report), which the company included in its 2003 Form 10-KSB.  
Safe Travel, Meridian, and InterCare, collectively, paid Smith $9,500 for the audit work.4
 
              6.           At the time Smith prepared and issued the Safe Travel, Meridian, and InterCare 
audit reports, he was not registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the 
Board), as required by Section 102(a) of the Act.  
 
C.     VIOLATIONS 
 
       1.      Section 102(a) of the Act provides that it shall be unlawful for any person that is 
not a registered public accounting firm to prepare or issue, or to participate in the preparation or 
issuance of, any audit report with respect to any issuer.5
                                                         
 
       2.      The provisions of Section 102(a) of the Act became effective on October 22, 2003. 6
                                                                                                   

                                                 
4
       During the course of the Commissions investigation, Smith voluntarily reimbursed Safe 
Travel, Meridian, and InterCare the $9,500 in audit fees through the provision of non-audit or 
other services to the issuers.  In view of Smiths reimbursement, the Commission is not ordering 
disgorgement in this matter. 
 
5
       A violation of the Act or any rule that the Board issues under the Act is treated for all 
purposes in the same manner as a violation of the Exchange Act, including with respect to 
penalties.  Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 15 U.S.C.A. § 7202(b)(1) (West 2002). 
 
6
       Section 102(a) became effective [b]eginning 180 days after the date of the determination 
of the Commission under Section 101(d) of the Act that the Board was prepared to undertake its 
statutory responsibilities.  The Commission made the required determination on April 25, 2003.

       3.      Based on the conduct described above, Respondent willfully    7
                                                                               violated Section 
102(a) of the Act. 
 
D. FINDINGS 
 
              Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that Smith willfully violated Section 102(a) 
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 
 
E.     UNDERTAKING 
 
              Respondent undertakes not to request, demand, or accept, directly or indirectly, any 
compensation from Safe Travel, Meridian, and InterCare in connection with the audit work 
associated with the audit reports for these companies.  In determining whether to accept the Offer, 
the Commission has considered this undertaking. 
 
                                                 IV. 
                                                   
        In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in Respondents Offer. 
 
              Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that: 
 
       A.          Smith shall cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any 
future violations of Section 102(a) of the Act. 
        
       B.          Smith is censured.      
        
       C.          Smith may practice before the Commission as an independent accountant provided 
that:    
        
               1.           The public accounting firm with which he is associated is registered with 
the Board in accordance with the Act, and such registration continues to be effective; and 
                
                
                
                
                

                                                                                                                                                             
See Order Regarding Section 101(d) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Securities Act Release 
No. 8223, Exchange Act Release No. 47746, 2003 WL 1956164  (Apr. 25, 2003).           
 
7
       Willfully as used in this Offer means intentionally committing the act that constitutes 
the violation.  There is no requirement that the actor also be aware that he is violating a rule or 
statute.  See Wonsover v. SEC, 205 F.3d 408, 414 (D.C. Cir. 2000); Tager v. SEC, 344 F.2d 5, 8 
(2d Cir. 1965).

                                        2.           He has submitted to the Commission staff (attention: Office of the Chief 
Accountant) the Boards letter notifying the public accounting firm with which he is associated that 
its registration application has been approved.
