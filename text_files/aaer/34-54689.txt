Respondent.                                 SECTION 21C OF THE SECURITIES 
                                            EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934  
                                             
                                           I.  
 
      The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate that cease-
and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), against Horst Hansen (“Hansen” or “Respondent”).   
                                             
                                          II.  
 
      In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has agreed to accept.  Solely for the purpose of  
these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the Commission, or to 
which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings  herein, except as 
to the Commission’s jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these proceedings, which are  
admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, 
Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order Pursuant to Section 21C of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Order”) as set forth below.     
 
                                          III.  
 
      On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that:  
 
      1.     Respondent, 71 years old, is a German  citizen and resides in Ahrenberg, Germany. 
In 1966 Respondent joined the German company OTTO (Gmbh & Co.) KG (hereinafter “OTTO”).  
In 1974 he was appointed to OTTO’s Board of Directors and was promoted to the Chief Financial 
Officer of OTTO.  OTTO acquired Spiegel, Inc. (“Spiegel”) in 1982 and Respondent was then 
appointed to Spiegel’s Board of Directors.  Respondent became a member of Spiegel’s Audit 
---------------------Page 2---------------------

Committee in 1987 and from 2000 to 2003 Respondent was the Chair of Spiegel’s three-member  
Audit Committee.   
 
       2.      Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act requires publicly held companies to file certain 
information and documents with the Commission, in accordance   with rules and regulations the  
Commission prescribes as necessary or appropriate  to protect investors and insure fair dealing in 
securities.  Pursuant to Section 13(a)(2) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 
promulgated thereunder, documents that must be filed include annual and quarterly reports.   
 
       3.      As a publicly held company whose securities traded on the Nasdaq, Spiegel was 
required to comply with Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act.  In compliance with that section, 
Spiegel timely filed its required quarterly and annual reports with the SEC through the filing of its  
third quarter 2001 Form 10-Q quarterly report on November 13, 2001.  Sp iegel’s 2001 Form 10-K 
annual report was due to be filed with the Commission on March 31, 2002.   
 
       4.      In February 2002 Spiegel’s independent auditor advised that it would have to 
consider including a “going concern” modification on its audit report of Spiegel’s 2001 financial 
statements unless Spiegel obtained either new credit or waivers from its lending banks for all 
breaches of loan covenants through December 31, 2002.  
 
       5.      Spiegel had not obtained either new credit facilities or waivers of all breaches of  
loan covenants through 2002 on the day its 2001 Form 10-K was to be filed with the Commission.  
Spiegel’s management did not want to file its 2001 Form 10-K with a “going concern”  
modification.  Thus, on March 31, 2002 Spiegel filed a Form 12b-25 which advised that its 2001 
Form 10-K would be filed within 15 days.  The Form 12b-25 stated that Spiegel was “not in a 
position to issue financial statements for its 2001 fiscal year pending resolution of” its lack of  
compliance with its loan covenants and its sale of FCNB.  The Form did not mention the “going 
concern” modification of Spiegel’s independent auditor.   
 
       6.      Spiegel still had not obtained either new credit facilities or waivers of its breaches 
of loan covenants on April 15, 2002, when the 15 day period provided under the Form 12b-25 
expired.  Spiegel’s American management recommended on that day that Spiegel not file at all 
rather than file with a “going concern” modification.   
 
       7.      Spiegel’s first quarter 2002 Form 10-Q was due to be filed with the Commission on 
May 15, 2002.  Spiegel again did not file its required report but instead filed a Form 12b-25, which 
stated only that it was not in a position to file its Form  10-Q pending resolution of its debt covenant 
violations and acquisition of new credit facilities.   
 
       8.      Spiegel’s decision not to file its 2002 first quarter Form 10-Q kept material 
information from the public markets.  Had Spiegel timely filed, it would have been required to 
disclose that on February 18, 2002 Spiegel reached its $700 million borrowing capacity under its  
revolving credit facility and it had no other available letter of credit facilities.

       9.      On May 29, 2002 Spiegel’s general counsel advised Respondent that Section 20(c) 
of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78t(c)] prohibited directors and officers from hindering, delaying 
or obstructing the filing of a required report without just cause.  On May 29, 2002 Spiegel’s Chief 
Executive Officer (“CEO”) wrote  to Respondent, acknowledging that although not filing the 2001 
Form 10-K violated federal securities laws, he preferred a delisting of Spiegel’s stock rather than 
filing with a “going concern” modification.  The CEO changed his mind the next day and 
recommended that Spiegel file the 2001 Form 10-K under any circumstances.  The CEO, however,    
did not inform Respondent that he had changed his mind.   
 
       10.     On May 31, 2002 Respondent, who had his own vote and the proxy of the second 
member of Spiegel’s Audit Committee, met with the third member of  the Audit Committee.  
Respondent and the other Audit Committee member telephoned Spiegel’s American corporate 
counsel to ask what the consequences were if Spiegel still did not file its 2001 Form 10-K.  
Spiegel’s outside counsel advised filing and told them Spiegel and its individual employees were 
running risks by the continued refusal to file.  Despite this legal advice, Respondent and the other  
member of the Audit Committee voted shortly thereafter to recommend postponing Spiegel’s 2001 
Form 10-K and 2002 first quarter Form 10-Q until Spiegel’s auditor provided an unqualified audit 
opinion. 
 
       11.     Thereafter Spiegel’s three-member Board Committee, which made all decisions for  
Spiegel between the semi-annual Board of Directors meetings, adopted the Audit Committee’s 
recommendation not to file until an unqualified audit opinion was obtained.  Respondent was not a 
member of Spiegel’s Board Committee.  
 
       12.     Spiegel filed its 2001 Form 10-K on February 4, 2003, only after SEC staff advised 
that they intended to recommend the Commission take enforcement action against Spiegel.  The 
Form 10-K, filed over fifteen months after Spiegel’s prior public filing, disclosed that 
shareholders’ equity had decreased from $792 million to $215 million, total assets had shrunk from 
$2.7 billion to $1.9 billion and total debt increased from $795 million to $1 billion.   
 
       13.     On February 26, 2003 Spiegel filed its first, second and third quarter 2002 Forms  
10-Q with the Commission.   
 
       14.     On March 7, 2003 the Commission filed a complaint agai nst Spiegel, Inc. in the 
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois which in part alleged that Spiegel’s failure 
to timely file its required reports violated Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 
13a-13 promulgated thereunder.  On March 27, 2003, the Court entered an Amended Partial Final 
Judgment in which Spiegel, without admitting or denying the substantive allegations of the 
Commission’s complaint, agreed to the Judgment including an Order that in part permanently 
enjoined it from violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 
promulgated thereunder.  Spiegel filed for bankruptcy on March 17, 2003 and on July 23, 2004 
registration of its shares was revoked pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Exchange Act. 
 
       15.     Respondent caused Spiegel to violate Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules  
13a-1 and 13a-13 promulgated thereunder by recommending, as a Director of Spiegel and the  

                                               3

Chair of Spiegel’s Audit Committee, that Spiegel withhold filing its required reports with the 
Commission until Spiegel obtained the opinion it desired from its outside auditor.

        16.      In connection with any related judicial or administrative proceeding or  
investigation commenced by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party, Respondent 
has undertaken to be interviewed by Commission staff, either in Germany or by telephone, and 
to testify, either in Germany or by telephone, as requested by the staff upon reasonable notice.     
 
                                                      IV. 
                                                         
         In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in Respondent Hansen’s Offer. 
 
         Accordingly, it is hereby  ORDERED that Respondent cease and desist from causing any  
violations and any future violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-
13 thereunder.   
 
 By the Commission.
