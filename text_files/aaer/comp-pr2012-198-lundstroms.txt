        Plaintiff, Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”), alleges that: 

                                  I.   SUMMARY OF ACTION 
 
        1.       This case involves fraudulent misstatements and omissions regarding mounting 

loan-related losses at the Lincoln, Nebraska-based financial institution known as TierOne Bank 

during the height of the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009.   

        2.       Between approximately October 2008 and November 2009 (the “relevant 

period”), defendant Gilbert G. Lundstrom (“G. Lundstrom”), the former chairman of the board 

and chief executive officer of TierOne Corporation (with its wholly-owned subsidiary TierOne 

Bank, referred to collectively hereafter as “TierOne”), and defendant James A. Laphen 

(“Laphen”), TierOne’s former president and chief operating officer, participated in a scheme to 

mislead TierOne’s bank regulator and investors about TierOne’s true financial condition.  They 

did so by materially understating TierOne’s loan losses and losses on real estate repossessed by 

the bank (commonly referred to as “other real estate owned” or “OREO”) so that the bank would 

appear to meet its mandated regulatory capital requirements.  G. Lundstrom and Laphen also 

made and/or caused TierOne to make material misstatements in TierOne’s public filings with the

Commission, including its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, and the Forms 10-

Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2009, and June 30, 2009.   

       3.      TierOne was a century-old thrift bank that had historically focused on residential 

and agricultural loans in the Nebraska/Iowa/Kansas region.  Beginning in about 2004, TierOne 

expanded into riskier types of lending in high-growth geographic regions such as Las Vegas, 

Florida, and Arizona.  By the second half of 2008, as a result of the financial crisis and 

accompanying crash in real estate markets, TierOne was experiencing a significant rise in high-

risk problem loans.   

       4.      In June 2008, due to these high-risk problem loans, the United States Office of 

Thrift Supervision (“OTS”), which oversaw thrift banks like TierOne, directed TierOne to 

maintain elevated core and risk-based capital ratios or face formal enforcement actions.  To 

appear to comply with the new heightened capital requirements, G. Lundstrom and Laphen 

materially understated TierOne’s loan and OREO losses.  In particular, G. Lundstrom and 

Laphen disregarded information showing that the collateral securing certain of TierOne’s loans 

and TierOne’s OREO was substantially over-valued due to the bank’s reliance on stale and 

inadequately discounted appraisals.  G. Lundstrom and Laphen also signed untrue management 

representation letters that were provided to the bank’s outside auditor and knowingly 

circumvented and failed to implement an effective system of internal controls at TierOne.   

       5.      As a result, G. Lundstrom and Laphen made and/or caused TierOne to make 

material misstatements in three periodic filings with the Commission regarding its loan and 

OREO losses and, in turn, to materially understate its net losses in those periodic filings and the 

related earnings releases in Forms 8-K filed on February 25, 2009, May 7, 2009, and August 10, 

2009.  In addition, TierOne reported that it had met or exceeded the OTS-required elevated 

                                               2

capital ratios in each of the three periodic filings.  TierOne met those ratios only by understating 

its losses, and thereby overstating its reported capital.    

       6.      G. Lundstrom certified the periodic filings at issue, when he knew, or was 

severely reckless in not knowing, that those filings contained material misrepresentations. 

       7.      The full extent of TierOne’s loan-related losses did not become publicly known 

until late 2009, after OTS required TierOne to obtain new appraisals for its impaired loans. 

TierOne ultimately disclosed over $130 million of  additional loan losses.  Had TierOne recorded 

these additional loss provisions in the proper quarters, it would have missed the OTS-required 

capital ratios as of the end of December 31, 2008, and for each quarter thereafter.  Following the 

announcements of the additional loss provisions, TierOne’s stock price dropped more than 70 

percent.  TierOne eventually filed for bankruptcy shortly after the bank was shut down by OTS 

in June 2010. 

       8.      Separately, in 2009, G. Lundstrom tipped his son, Trevor A. Lundstrom (“T. 

Lundstrom”), with material non-public information about an anticipated asset sale between 

TierOne and Great Western Bank (“Great Western”).  Having received this material non-public 

information from his father, T. Lundstrom bought nearly 210,000 TierOne shares between June 

2009 and September 2009 in anticipation of the asset sale.  Following the announcement of the 

proposed transaction on September 4, 2009, T. Lundstrom sold his TierOne holdings and 

realized approximately $225,921 in illicit profits. 

                           II.   JURISDICTION AND VENUE  

       9.      The Commission brings this action pursuant to the authority conferred upon it by 

Sections 21(d), 21(e), and 21A(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) [15 

U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u(e) and 78u-1(a)].

       10.     This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(e), 21A(a), 

and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(e), 78u-                                                1(a), and 78aa].  Defendants, directly and 

indirectly, have made use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, of the mails, 

or of the facilities of a national securities exchange, in connection with the transactions, acts, 

practices, and courses of business alleged herein. 

       11.     Venue lies in this Court pursuant to Sections 27 and 21A(d)(4) of the Exchange 

Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78aa and 78u-1(d)(4)] because certain of the acts, transactions, practices, and 

courses of business constituting the violations of law alleged herein occurred within the District   

of Nebraska.  Moreover, defendants G. Lundstrom and Laphen reside in this District. 

                   III.   DEFENDANTS AND RELEVANT ENTITY 
 
       12.     Gilbert G. Lundstrom, age 70, is a resident of Lincoln, Nebraska.  At all relevant 

times, G. Lundstrom served as TierOne’s chairman of the board and chief executive officer 

(“CEO”).  He signed and certified TierOne’s periodic filings with the Commission at issue in this 

matter.   

       13.     James A. Laphen, age 63, is a resident of Omaha, Nebraska.  At all relevant times, 

Laphen served as TierOne’s president and chief operating officer (“COO”) and as a member of 

the board of directors.  Laphen signed TierOne’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 

2008. 

       14.     Trevor A. Lundstrom, age 41, is a resident of Birmingham, Alabama, and is G. 

Lundstrom’s son.  

       15.     TierOne Corporation, a Wisconsin corpor  ation, was, at all relevant times, a 

holding company for TierOne Bank, a federally chartered savings bank.  Prior to May 7, 2010, 

TierOne’s shares were listed on the NASDAQ GS exchange under the stock symbol “TONE.”  

                                               4

TierOne’s common stock was thereafter quoted on the Pink Sheets, which is operated by OTC 

Markets Group Inc.                          OTS closed TierOne Bank on June 4, 2010.  The Federal Deposit Insurance 

Corporation (“FDIC”) was named receiver and Great Western took over the bank’s assets and 

deposit accounts.  TierOne filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection on June 24, 2010.   

                           IV.    SUMMARY OF VIOLATIONS

                                        V.     FACTS  

A.     Background of TierOne’s Asset and Capital Problems 
 
       20.     Although TierOne had traditionally focused on residential and agricultural loans 

in the Midwest, beginning in approximately 2004, TierOne opened loan production offices 

(“LPOs”) in several high-growth areas, such as Las Vegas, Florida, and Arizona.  A significant 

number of the LPO loans were made to real estate developers in which repayment was 

                                               6 

 
---------------------Page 7---------------------

          8:12-cv-00343   Doc # 1   Filed: 09/25/12   Page 7 of 31 - Page ID # 7                       
 

contingent on the completion and sale or refinancing of the projects.  This strategy made the 

bank particularly vulnerable to the fallout from the financial crisis, as the high-growth areas in 

which TierOne had opened its LPOs were hardest hit by the dramatic fall in real estate prices.  

By at least 2008, a significant number of real estate projects funded by TierOne’s LPO loans had 

faltered or were faltering.    

       21.     In June 2008, OTS concluded that TierOne’s asset quality had deteriorated and 

directed TierOne to maintain higher core and risk-based capital ratios.  These heightened 

regulatory capital requirements were ultimately incorporated into a formal Supervisory 

Agreement that OTS imposed on TierOne in January 2009.   

       22.     Complying with the terms of the Supervisory Agreement, including meeting its 

elevated capital requirements, was needed to prevent further enforcement actions.  Such actions  

could have included the removal of management or the seizure of the bank. 

       23.     Meeting the OTS-required capital ratios was difficult, and became increasingly 

more difficult, given the bank’s rising level of non-performing loans.  As detailed below, rather 

than properly calculating its loan and OREO losses – and face regulatory sanctions – G. 

Lundstrom and Laphen materially misstated the value of the bank’s collateral and OREO 

properties.  Their purpose was to allow the bank to falsely report to OTS and the investing public 

that TierOne had met and was continuing to meet the new, higher, OTS-mandated capital 

requirements.  

B. 	   G. Lundstrom and Laphen Engaged in a Scheme to Defraud OTS and TierOne’s 
       Investors 
 
       24.     Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or “GAAP,” provides that a loan 

becomes “impaired” when it is probable that the bank will be unable to collect all amounts due 

                                               7

under the original loan agreement.  In addition, TierOne’s written lending policy stated that a 

loan greater than 90 days past due should be considered impaired.  

       25.     Under GAAP, TierOne was required to assess probable losses associated with its 

impaired loans and record those losses in its allowance for loan and lease losses 

(“ALLL”).  GAAP permits the impairment to be measured using the fair value of the underlying 

collateral if the loan is collateral dependent, which is the method that was typically utilized by 

TierOne.  

       26.     Any increase in ALLL (a balance sheet item) must be accompanied by the 

recording of a provision for loan losses (an income statement item), thereby increasing reported 

loss and further eroding the bank’s capital, which, in turn, negatively impacted the bank’s ability 

to meet the OTS-required elevated capital ratios.   

       27.     Some of TierOne’s real estate loans were eventually foreclosed upon and the 

underlying collateral became the property of the bank, or OREO.  GAAP required TierOne to 

carry OREO on its books at the lower of the property’s book value or fair value, less costs to sell 

the property. 

       28.     Thus, a key consideration under GAAP regarding the existence and magnitude of 

losses for impaired loans or OREO is the fair value of the collateral or OREO property.  A recent 

appraisal performed by an independent and certified real estate appraiser is normally the best 

evidence of a property’s fair value.  In the absence of a current appraisal, all relevant and current 

information known at the time must be used.  This information includes: the most recent 

evidence of market declines, broker price opinions (“BPO”), recent comparable sales, internal 

determinations of value, current project status and offers to purchase or sell.   

                                                8

       29.     In this case, TierOne intentionally delayed the process of obtaining current 

appraisals for properties that had declined in value, relying instead on inaccurate data and 

assumptions. 

       30.     In addition to the GAAP requirements, TierOne’s written lending policy 

contained detailed sections describing when new appraisals should be obtained.  For example, 

this policy expressly noted that “[i]n a rapidly escalating or deteriorating market” – such as the 

one the bank was facing in 2008 and 2009 – “an appraisal may be valid for only a few months.” 

TierOne’s lending policy also required new appraisals for loan modifications involving the 

extension of additional credit “if the market or property has deteriorated to the point where the 

Bank’s collateral is threatened.”  As described below, G. Lundstrom and Laphen failed to adhere 

to these policies.   

       31.     TierOne evaluated its loan loss provisions through an informal committee that 

included TierOne’s chief credit officer and TierOne’s special assets executive (who was involved 

in certain troubled loan workouts).  The conclusions of the committee were documented in 

spreadsheets that contained estimates of collateral values and loan impairment determinations.  

Once the final ALLL numbers were determined by the committee, a report including the reserves 

for each impaired loan was presented to TierOne’s formal Asset Classification Committee, on 

which G. Lundstrom and Laphen sat, for approval. 

       32.     TierOne also had a Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“SOX”) 302 Certification 

Disclosure Committee (“SOX 302 Committee”) that reviewed TierOne’s periodic filings before 

they were filed with the Commission.  G. Lundstrom and Laphen were members of this 

committee.  As part of the SOX 302 Committee meetings, each of the members provided 

positive assurances that: (1) there was no reason to believe that the company’s internal controls 

                                               9

were inadequate to ensure all material information was known to TierOne’s officers; (2) no one 

believed the financial statements failed to present fairly in all material respects the company’s 

results of operations and financial condition; (3) no one believed the periodic report contained 

material misstatements or omissions; and (4) there was no other reason why it would be unwise 

or inappropriate for the certifying officers to swear to the disclosures in the periodic report.   

       33.     Rather than comply with GAAP and the bank’s own policies, G. Lundstrom and 

Laphen manipulated TierOne’s loss provisions, primarily by relying on stale and inadequately 

discounted real estate appraisals while ignoring other available information that would require 

write-downs.  For example: 

       1.     Gemm Homes  

       34.     In January 2008, TierOne foreclosed on a real estate development loan to 

borrower Gemm Homes.  A September 2007 appraisal                             valued the Gemm Homes property at $5.1 

million. 

       35.     In late June 2008, TierOne received several BPOs for the property that had an 

average value of around $3 million.  In October 2008, TierOne’s participating lender obtained an 

appraisal that similarly showed a property value of $3 million.   

       36.     In early March 2009, TierOne’s special assets executive informed Laphen of the 

$3 million appraisal, but Laphen ignored it.  

       37.     In May 2009, the participating lender wrote a letter to the special assets executive 

(copying Laphen) demanding that TierOne respond to its proposal to market and sell the Gemm 

Homes property in the $3 million range.   

       38.     In an email dated May 21, 2009, the special assets executive summarized the 

Gemm Homes situation to Laphen:   

                                               10

       The [Gemm Homes] appraisal was delivered to [TierOne] in the 4    th
                                                                           quarter of 
       2008, and [TierOne] chose to not accept this appraisal, as it would have resulted 
       in a $1.8MM additional write-down. . . . [The participating lender] has been 
       insisting on listing the property for something in the $3MM range, and after 
       discussing this matter with Management, TOB elected not to list the property at  
       the recommended $3MM amount, as it would have also triggered the required 
       $1.8MM write-down. . . . [O]ur refusal to accept the updated appraisal and market 
       the [Gemm Homes] property is imprudent.   

       39.     Notwithstanding this information, Laphen rejected the special assets executive’s 

recommendation to write-down the Gemm Homes property.  

       40.     G. Lundstrom and Laphen then approved TierOne’s purchase of the participating 

lender’s interest in the transaction (even though it was apparent TierOne would ultimately incur a 

sizeable loss).  This acquisition effectively covered up TierOne’s improper failure to write-down 

the Gemm Homes property. 

       41.     TierOne did not book the appropriate $1.8 million OREO loss provision for 

Gemm Homes during the relevant period.  Further, neither G. Lundstrom nor Laphen alerted  

TierOne’s accounting staff or outside auditor to the October 2008 appraisal.      

       2. Escapa loans 

       42.     TierOne made a series of loans, totaling approximately $17 million, to Las Vegas 

developer Escapa.  By at least early 2008, these loans were impaired.   

       43.     On September 18, 2008, TierOne’s loan workout consultant located in Las Vegas 

sent an email to Laphen, later forwarded to G. Lundstrom, with his written estimates of the value 

of the collateral for several Escapa loans.  These estimates showed millions of dollars of losses 

within the Escapa portfolio as compared to the amounts TierOne had on its books.   

       44.     Neither G. Lundstrom nor Laphen caused TierOne to order new appraisals or 

otherwise re-evaluate the value of the collateral supporting the Escapa loans.  As a result, 

                                               11

TierOne’s loss provisions associated with the Escapa loans were inadequate by millions of  

dollars.   

       3.     Towne Vistas loan  

       45.     Towne Vistas was a large condominium project in Las Vegas financed by a $32.3 

million loan from TierOne, one of the largest loans at the bank.   

       46.     In the first quarter of 2009, TierOne’s Las Vegas workout consultant informed 

Laphen that the project was likely worth only $15 million, or half the loan amount.  However, 

Laphen did not cause TierOne to order a new appraisal or otherwise re-evaluate the collateral 

value supporting the loan, or share this information with TierOne’s internal accountants or 

external auditor.  Instead, the $15 million value was ignored and the loan was deemed “not 

impaired” for the first quarter of 2009 based on a stale, un-discounted 2005 appraisal showing a 

value of $46.5 million.   

       47.     In mid-June 2009, both G. Lundstrom and Laphen were informed that the $15 

million value for the Towne Vistas project was based on a residential appraisal recently obtained 

by the borrower on a finished condo unit in the project.  However, a new appraisal for the entire 

project was not ordered, the $15 million value was ignored, and the stale 2005 appraisal was 

again used with no discount to support the decision not to impair the Towne Vistas loan for the 

second quarter of 2009. 

       4.     Brother Sonny/Jericho loans 

       48.     Brother Sonny was a real estate development project in Las Vegas financed by a 

$17.5 million loan from TierOne in 2006.  The loan was supported by a November 2006 

appraisal showing the real estate was worth $23.5 million, if completed.   

                                               12

        8:12-cv-00343   Doc # 1   Filed: 09/25/12   Page 13 of 31 - Page ID # 13                       
 

       49.     By September 2008, the Brother Sonny loan was over 90 days delinquent and 

millions were owed to various project vendors.  These factors should have caused the loan to be 

deemed impaired under GAAP.   Instead, Tier  One extended an additional $13.6 million in credit 

purportedly supported by a second lien position in a separate piece of real estate collateral called 

Jericho.  In an email dated August 28, 2008, TierOne’s chief credit officer wrote:  “I am totally 

bewildered that [Jericho] could ever be worth/appraised for numbers even half of what we’re 

being told it’s worth.” 

       50.     Even though TierOne’s own lending policy required new appraisals, neither G. 

Lundstrom nor Laphen caused TierOne to obtain appraisals for the Brother Sonny and Jericho 

collateral when they approved the loan modification in early September 2008.  Instead, the loan 

modification recommendation relied on the 2006 appraisal for the Brother Sonny property and an 

unsigned, expired letter of intent from a third party to purchase the Jericho parcel.  As a result, G. 

Lundstrom and Laphen masked the Brother Sonny delinquency so that the loan would be treated 

as a performing rather than impaired loan.  No impairment charge was taken during the relevant 

period, and TierOne understated its loan losses on the Brother Sonny/Jericho loan by millions of 

dollars. 

C. 	   G. Lundstrom and Laphen Knew, or Were Severely Reckless in Not Knowing, that 
       TierOne’s Loss Provisions Were Materially Understated 
 
       51.     In addition to the specific information on property values discussed above, G. 

Lundstrom and Laphen were also each alerted through repeated emails and reports to the 

accounting improprieties that occurred at TierOne. 

       52.     For example, on February 18, 2009, prior to the filing of TierOne’s Form 10-K 

for the year ended December 31, 2008, G. Lundstrom and Laphen received an email from  

TierOne’s special assets executive that stated, among other things:   

                                              13

       I’m not sure how to address these issues, but I remain concerned that we continue 
       to expose ourselves adversely on both the [ALLL] analysis and our OREO 
       properties with out-dated appraisals.  I understand the write-downs we would 
       experience would likely be astronomical, but in good conscience how long can we 
       continue to believe these are properly reserved?     

The email went on to list many loans and OREO (including Gemm Homes) that had stale 

appraisals.  G. Lundstrom and Laphen ignored this February 18, 2009 email.        

       53.     Further, in early 2009, G. Lundstrom requested an analysis of the losses within 

TierOne’s loan portfolio.  TierOne’s chief credit officer (and others) conducted what was, in 

substance, a loan reserve analysis.  The chief credit officer summarized the findings in an email 

dated February 17, 2009: 

       [I] spent the day estimating loss potential   by location and loan type and without a 
       clear explanation of the purpose of the exercise – so, completely in the dark as to 
       the reasons for the “drill,” we concluded that we needed another $65mm [million] 
       of reserves over and above those currently allocated.   

       54.     At approximately the same time, G. Lundstrom and Laphen rejected a 

contemporaneous recommendation from TierOne’s internal audit department (which was 

unaware of the February 17, 2009 email) to establish a mandatory annual re-appraisal policy for 

OREO, which would have been consistent with addressing the special assets executive’s 

concerns. 

       55.     Around mid-April 2009, G. Lundstrom requested a more detailed breakdown of 

the anticipated loan losses.  The chief credit officer and others estimated the embedded losses on 

a loan-by-loan basis and documented their conclusions in a spreadsheet presented to G. 

Lundstrom and Laphen on or before April 28, 2009.   This analysis (the “Best/Worst Case 

Scenario”) contained estimates of losses associated with over 120 properties/loans, many located 

in Las Vegas, and showed that TierOne needed additional loan loss provisions ranging between 

$36 million (best case), $60 million (expected case), and $114 million (worst case).  

                                              14

       56.     As shown in the following chart, the example loans discussed above in paragraphs 

42 through 50 were estimated to have multi-million dollar losses within the Best/Worst Case 

Scenario that, standing alone, would have caused TierOne to miss the OTS-mandated capital 

ratios: 

                                                  Best/Worst Case Scenario 

Loan                                    Best                Expected               Worst 

Escapa                                    $5,760,000            $7,980,000         $10,200,000 

Brother Sonny/Jericho                              0                     0         $13,000,000 

Towne Vistas                              $5,000,000          $10,000,000          $20,000,000 

TOTAL $10,760,000                                             $17,980,000          $43,200,000 

       57.     The Best/Worst Case Scenario was not, however, used to develop the ALLL and 

associated loan loss provisions that G. Lundstrom and Laphen approved and TierOne reported in 

the company’s periodic filings for the first or second quarters of 2009.  

       58.     On August 3, 2009, a week before TierOne filed its Form 10-Q for the second 

quarter of 2009, Laphen learned of a memorandum drafted by TierOne’s special assets 

executive.  The memo detailed TierOne’s continued reliance on stale appraisals and failure to 

book appropriate loan and OREO loss provisions.  The memo stated, among other things:   

              a.         “I remain convinced that we continue to fail to properly risk rate our 

              loans and we refuse to update collateral valuations, out of the fear of what impact 

              these actions may have on reserve levels.” 

              b.        “I am concerned that we are misleading the public.  All this 

              compounded by the fact that we are basing so much off of significantly aged 

              collateral valuations.”   

                                              15

        8:12-cv-00343   Doc # 1   Filed: 09/25/12   Page 16 of 31 - Page ID # 16                       
 

              c.         “I fully comprehend the impact updating collateral valuations on both 

              our watch credits and our OREO properties will have on the organization.”  

              d.        “I am unable to support the timing of reappraisals to delay loss 

              recognition or increases to the reserves into later quarters.” 

       59.     Laphen immediately told G. Lundstrom of the existence of the memo.  As with 

the February 18, 2009 email, no action was taken to correct the loan and OREO losses in 

TierOne’s financial statements.  Instead, G. Lundstrom and Laphen provided positive assurances 

at the SOX 302 Committee meeting that took place three days later that no one believed that the 

financial statements contained material misstatements or omissions.   

D.     The Scheme Was Exposed in the Third Quarter of 2009 
 
       60.     In August 2009, OTS directed TierOne to obtain updated appraisals.  The new 

appraisals revealed the actual values of TierOne’s collateral for impaired loans and OREO.  On 

October 14, 2009, TierOne filed a Form 8-K reporting an additional $13.9 million in loan loss 

provisions for the second quarter of 2009.  TierOne also announced that it intended to restate its 

second quarter 2009 financial statements, and that the bank’s capital ratios would fall below the 

levels required by OTS.  In the days following this news, TierOne’s stock price fell over 17 

percent, from approximately $3.27 per share to $2.69 per share.  

       61.     The situation worsened as more OTS-mandated appraisals came in.  On 

November 10, 2009, TierOne filed another Form 8-K reporting an additional loan loss provision 

of $120.2 million for the third quarter of 2009.  TierOne’s stock price dropped a further 54 

percent over the next three trading days, from  approximately $1.71 per share to $0.78 per share.   

       62.     TierOne was shut down by OTS on June 4, 2010, and filed for bankruptcy later 

that month.   

                                               16

E. 	   G. Lundstrom and Laphen Made Materially False Statements in TierOne’s Periodic 
       Filings with the Commission  
       
       63.     TierOne’s periodic filings with the Commission (and related earnings releases) 

contained the following loan loss provisions and net losses that materially understated – by 

millions – the amounts required by GAAP:  

               a.      TierOne’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, and its 

               February 25, 2009 Form 8-K, reported provisions for loan losses of $10.8 million 

               for the fourth quarter and $84.4 million for the year, and net losses of $3.8 million 

               for the fourth quarter and $75.2 million for the year.    

               b.      TierOne’s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2009, and the May 

               7, 2009 Form 8-K, reported provisions for loan losses of $12.2 million and a net 

               loss of $9.8 million.   

               c.      TierOne’s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2009 and its August 

               10, 2009 Form 8-K, reported provisions for loan losses of $21.7 million and a net 

               loss of $16.1 million.   

      64.     In addition, each of TierOne’s periodic filings at issue reported that TierOne was 

in compliance with its elevated regulatory capital requirements.  In particular, the filings stated 

as follows: 

               a. 	    Form 10-K (filed 3/13/09):  

       We are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal 
       banking agencies.  Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate 
       certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, 
       if undertaken, could have a direct material adverse effect on our financial 
       condition and results of operations . . . . [T]he OTS has required that the Bank 
       maintain a ratio of 11.0% (as opposed to 10.0%) with respect to total risk-based 
       capital to risk-weighted assets and a ratio of 8.5% (as opposed to 5.0%) with 

                                               17

       respect to core (Tier 1) capital.  As of December 31, 2008, the Bank exceeded 
       these elevated ratios mandated by the OTS.  

              b.      Form 10-Q (filed 5/8/09): 

       [T]he OTS has required that the Bank maintain a ratio of 11.0% with respect to 
       total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets and a ratio of 8.5% with respect to 
       core (Tier 1) capital. As of March 31, 2009, the Bank exceeded these elevated 
       ratios mandated by the OTS.  

              c.      Form 10-Q (filed 8/10/09): 

       [T]he OTS has required that the Bank maintain a ratio of 11.0% with respect to 
       total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets and a ratio of 8.5% with respect to 
       core (Tier 1) capital. As of June 30, 2009, the Bank met or exceeded these 
       elevated ratios mandated by the OTS.  

      65.     Had TierOne recorded appropriate loss provisions for each quarter at issue, it 

would have fallen below its required capital ratios from at least the period ending December 31, 

2008.  Thus, all of these periodic filings contained materially false disclosures concerning 

TierOne’s regulatory compliance.  

       66.     G. Lundstrom signed the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, and 

the Forms 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2009, and June 30, 2009; Laphen signed only 

the 2008 Form 10-K.  

F.     G. Lundstrom Falsely Certified TierOne’s Public Filings 
 
       67.     As TierOne’s CEO, G. Lundstrom was also required to certify that he had 

reviewed the bank’s public filings and that, based on his knowledge, they did not contain any 

material misstatements or omissions.  

       68.     Although G. Lundstrom knew, or was severely reckless in not knowing, that 

TierOne’s periodic filings contained material misrepresentations concerning its loan and OREO 

losses and compliance with the OTS-mandated capital ratios, he certified the Form 10-K for the 

                                               18

year ended December 31, 2008, and the Forms 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2009, and 

June 30, 2009. 

G. 	   G. Lundstrom and Laphen Circumvented TierOne’s Accounting Controls and 
       Caused TierOne’s Accounting Records to Be Falsified  
       
       69.     G. Lundstrom and Laphen failed to implement an effective  system of internal 

accounting controls, circumvented TierOne’s accounting controls, and caused TierOne’s 

accounting records to be falsified.  As discussed above, they failed to inform the bank’s 

accounting staff of information showing that TierOne had not taken adequate loan and OREO 

loss provisions.  They also approved the final reported ALLL even though they had information, 

including the Best/Worst Case Scenario described above in paragraphs 55 to 57, showing that 

TierOne was grossly under-reserved.  They further failed to adhere to TierOne’s own lending 

policy, which adversely impacted the bank’s financial reporting.  

       70.     In addition, on March 11, 2009, G. Lundstrom  falsely certified in TierOne’s Form  

10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, that he had evaluated the bank’s internal controls 

over financial reporting and that the controls were effective.  

H. 	   G. Lundstrom and Laphen are Liable For TierOne’s Securities Law Violations as 
       Control Persons 
        
       71.     As set forth herein, TierOne, through the acts and omissions of its officers, 

violated Exchange Act Sections 10(b), 13(a), and 13(b)(2) [15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b), 78m(a), and 

78m(b)(2)] and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 [7 C.F.R. §§ 240.10b-5, 

240.12b-20, 240.13a-1, 240.13a-11, and 240.13a-13]. 

       72.     G. Lundstrom, as TierOne’s chairman/CEO, and Laphen, as its 

president/COO/director, exercised control over the general operations of TierOne and possessed 

                                              19

the power to determine the specific acts or omissions upon which TierOne’s violations are 

predicated.  

I. 	   G. Lundstrom and Laphen Made Materially False Statements and/or Omissions to 
       TierOne’s Auditors 
 
       73.     To further advance their scheme, G. Lundstrom and Laphen made false 

representations to TierOne’s external auditors.   

       74.     In management representation letters to the auditors signed by G. Lundstrom in 

May and August 2009, he falsely claimed that: (1) TierOne’s financial statements were fairly 

presented in conformity with GAAP; (2) when material, provisions for loan and OREO losses 

had been recorded; (3) there were no loss contingencies required to be disclosed under the 

relevant GAAP; (4) he had no knowledge of any allegations of fraud or fraudulent activity 

received from employee communications; and (5) he had no knowledge of an officer taking 

actions to mislead the external auditor.  G. Lundstrom and Laphen made similar false statements 

in a management representation letter that they each signed on March 11, 2009.    

       75.     As noted above, G. Lundstrom and Laphen failed to alert the auditors when they 

received information showing that specific loan and OREO losses were understated and did not 

provide the auditors with the Best/Worst Case Scenario.  

J. 	   Insider Trading By T. Lundstrom and G. Lundstrom 
 
       76.     As TierOne’s chairman/CEO, G. Lundstrom owed a duty to TierOne and its 

shareholders.  Specifically, G. Lundstrom had a duty not to disclose any confidential information 

he learned during the course of his service as an officer and director, and not to use the 

information for his benefit or for the benefit of others.  

       77.     Prior to June 2009, G. Lundstrom knew, or was severely reckless in not knowing, 

that TierOne had a written “Statement of Policy and Procedures Governing Trading in Shares of 

                                              20

TierOne Corporation” (“Insider Trading Policy”) prohibiting the dissemination of any nonpublic 

information.  

       78.     The Insider Trading Policy stated, in pertinent part:   

              a.      “All Company Personnel are expected to maintain the confidentiality of 

              nonpublic information obtained in the course of their relationship with 

              [TierOne]”;  

              b.      “sales of substantial assets” is a type of information that should be kept 

              confidential; and 

              c.      “[Y]ou are prohibited from ‘tipping’ others.  The concept of unlawful 

              tipping includes passing on information to family members . . . .”  

       79.     T. Lundstrom was aware prior to June 2009 that his father served as the 

chairman/CEO of TierOne and knew, or was severely reckless in not knowing, that his father 

owed a duty to TierOne and its shareholders.     

       80.     In approximately January 2009, G. Lundstrom discussed with Great Western a 

possible sale of substantial assets by TierOne.  From approximately January through September 

2009, G. Lundstrom acted as one of TierOne’s lead negotiators concerning the asset sale to Great 

Western.  

       81.     As a result of TierOne’s potential asset sale to Great Western, and pursuant to 

TierOne’s Insider Trading Policy, on May 29, 2009, certain TierOne officers and directors, 

including G. Lundstrom, were subjected to a “Blackout Period” prohibiting purchases and sales 

of TierOne securities.  The Blackout Period extended from June 10, 2009, through August 5, 

2009, and was later extended through September 4, 2009.   

                                               21

       82.     On June 15, 2009, G. Lundstrom, on behalf of TierOne, executed a confidentiality 

agreement with Great Western regarding the potential asset sale transaction.   

       83.     On June 16, 2009, G. Lundstrom and other executives and advisors for TierOne 

met with representatives of Great Western in Chicago, Illinois, to discuss the terms of the 

proposed asset sale, which included the sale of specific TierOne branch offices, performing 

loans, and other assets.  

       84.     On June 17, 2009, a working model of the asset sale was sent to certain TierOne 

personnel, including G. Lundstrom, valuing the sale at $1.6 billion.   

       85.     On June 17, 2009, T. Lundstrom arrived in Lincoln, Nebraska, from Birmingham, 

Alabama, to visit his father and participate in a three-day golf tournament at a country club in 

which G. Lundstrom was a member.  T. Lundstrom stayed at G. Lundstrom’s home from Friday, 

June 17 through Sunday, June 21, 2009.  

       86.     On June 18, 2009, G. and T. Lundstrom spent many hours together playing as a 

team in the golf tournament at the country club.   

       87.     On or about June 18, 2009, G. Lundstrom  tipped T. Lundstrom with material 

nonpublic information regarding TierOne’s potential asset sale to Great Western.   

       88.     At approximately 10:30 p.m. on June 18, 2009, T. Lundstrom placed an order to 

purchase 10,000 shares of TierOne common stock for approximately $19,500.  This was the first 

in a series of 113 purchase orders for TierOne stock that T. Lundstrom placed in accounts he 

owned or controlled between June 18, 2009, and September 2, 2009.  

       89.     Within ten days from his June 18th
                                                 purchase, T. Lundstrom liquidated all non-

TierOne equities held in the brokerage accounts he owned and controlled in order to purchase 

TierOne common stock.  

                                              22

       90.     In addition, the next month T. Lundstrom leveraged his insider trading by 

borrowing funds at significant interest rates to acquire TierOne stock.  On July 10, 2009, T. 

Lundstrom applied for a personal, unsecured $75,000 bank loan with an interest rate of 8.95 

percent.  He received these funds on July 24, 2009, and used the funds for the sole purpose of 

purchasing TierOne stock.  On July 26, 2009, T. Lundstrom applied for a credit card with a 

$53,000 limit and interest rate of 10.99 percent.  On August 4, 2009, he obtained a $50,000 cash 

advance from the credit card and used the funds for the sole purpose of purchasing TierOne 

stock.  

       91.     While G. Lundstrom continued to negotiate the asset sale with Great Western, T. 

and G. Lundstrom continued to communicate periodically and T. Lundstrom continued to 

purchase TierOne stock.    

       92.     Between June 18, 2009, and September 2, 2009, T. Lundstrom acquired 209,985 

shares of TierOne stock for a total purchase price of $431,332 in accounts he owned and 

controlled on the basis of material nonpublic information supplied by his father.  

       93.     On Friday, September 4, 2009, at approximately 8:00 a.m., TierOne announced 

that it had agreed to sell to Great Western $1.1 billion in deposits, $800 million in loans, and $20  

million in real estate.  G. Lundstrom e-mailed the September 4th
                                                                announcement to T. Lundstrom  

shortly after its release.   

       94.     Following the announcement, TierOne’s stock price closed up over 45 percent to 

$3.13 per share.  

       95.     T. Lundstrom thereafter sold all of the TierOne stock that he had acquired 

between June 18, 2009, and September 2, 2009.  T. Lundstrom’s total ill-gotten gains from the 

                                               23

TierOne stock that he purchased on the basis of inside information tipped from his father is 

approximately $225,921.

                        [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b) and 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5]

statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and any other criteria 

applicable to such statements, in violation of Section 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act.

1, 13a-11, and 13a-13. 

       128.    As TierOne’s chairman/CEO and president/COO/director, respectively,
