      The Securities and Exchange Commission deems it appropriate  to issue an order of 
forthwith suspension of Robert D. Graham (“Graham”) pursuant to Rule 102(e)(2) of the 
Commission’s Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R. § 201.102(e)(2)].1 
                                                         
 
                                           II. 
       
      The Commission finds that:  
 
      1.     Graham was a senior vice president and assistant general counsel at General Re 
Corporation (“Gen Re”), which he joined in 1986.  Graham has been a member of the Delaware 
Bar since 1973, but his license has been suspended since April 18, 2008, pending the results of 
the criminal action against him.  Graham also has been a member of the Connecticut Bar since 
1988, but his license has been on administrative suspension since May 22, 2007 for failure to pay 
that State’s client security fund fee.    
       
       
      2.     On May 7, 2009, a judgment of conviction was entered against Graham in United

      Rule 102(e)(2) provides in pertinent part:  “Any ... person who has been convicted of a 
felony or a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude shall be forthwith suspended from appearing 
or practicing before the Commission.”

States v. Robert D. Graham, et al, No. 06 CR 137 (CFD), in the United States District Court for 
the District of Connecticut, finding him guilty of sixteen felony counts, including 1 count of 
conspiracy to violate the Federal securities laws and to commit mail fraud, 7 counts of securities 
fraud, 5 counts of making false statements to the Commission, and 3 counts of mail fraud.  The 
indictment charged Graham with engaging in a fraudulent scheme to help American International 
Group, Inc. (“AIG”) structure a sham reinsurance transaction in order to make it appear as if AIG 
had increased its loss reserves by $250 million in the fourth quarter of 2000 and by an additional 
$250 million in the first quarter of 2001.  
        
       3.     The court sentenced Graham to 12 months and 1 day imprisonment followed by 
24 months of supervised release and ordered him to pay a fine of $100,000. 
 
                                              III. 
 
       In view of the foregoing, the Commission finds that Graham has been convicted of a 
felony within the meaning of Rule 102(e)(2) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice. 
 
       Accordingly, it is ORDERED, that Robert D. Graham, Esq. is forthwith suspended from 
appearing or practicing before the Commission pursuant to Rule 102(e)(2) of the Commission’s 
Rules of Practice.  
        
 
       By the Commission.

                                               2
