                                                 I.  
 
       The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the 
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against John W. 
Dwyer, CPA (“Respondent” or “Dwyer”) pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(i) of the Commission’s Rules 
of Practice.1 
               
                                                   

                                                 
1
 Rule 102(e)(3)(i) provides, in relevant part, that:  
 
       The Commission, with due regard to the public interest an d without preliminary hearing, may, by order, . . .  
       suspend from appearing or practicing before it any . . . accountant . . . who has been by name:                      
 
               (A) permanently enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction, by reason of his or her                                  
               misconduct in an action brought by the Commission, from violating or aiding and abetting the     
               violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or of the rules and regulations thereunder.

                                               II.  
 
       In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the 
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings  
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these 
proceedings, and the findings contained in Section III.3 below, which are admitted, Respondent  
consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Public Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Rule 
102(e) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial  
Sanctions (“Order”), as set forth below.   
 
                                              III.  
 
       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that:  
 
              1.      Dwyer, age 57, was Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) of Bally Total Fitness 
Holding Corporation (“Bally”) from  May 1994 to April 2004, when he was forced to resign.  Prior  
to his employment at Bally, Dwyer was an audit partner in the Chicago office of Ernst & Young 
LLP.  At all relevant times, Dwyer was a certified public accountant. 
        
              2.      Bally purported to be the largest, and only nationwide, commercial operator  
of fitness centers.  At all relevant times, Bally's common stock was registered with the Commission 
pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and traded on 
the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”).  The NYSE delisted Bally's common stock on June 8, 
2007.  After filing for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, on September 17, 
2007, Bally emerged as a privately held reorganized entity.   
        
              3.      On December 17, 2009, the Commission filed a complaint against Dwyer in 
SEC v. John W. Dwyer, 09-CV-2386 (CKK)(D.D.C.).  On December 22, 2009, the court entered 
an order permanently enjoining Dwyer, by consent, from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities 
Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 
thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) 
of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder. 
        
              4.      The Commission’s complaint alleges, among other things, that during the 
relevant time period, Dwyer violated the anti-fraud provisions, and aided and abetted Bally’s 
violations of the reporting, record-keeping, and internal controls provisions, of the Federal 
securities laws.  The complaint also alleges that Dwyer is responsible for Bally’s materially false 
and misleading statements about its financial condition in filings with the Commission and in 
other public statements. These materially false and misleading  statements portrayed Bally's 
financial condition (its net worth) and its performance (its income) as being materially better than 
they actually were during the relevant period.

                                                                                  IV. 
                                                                                      
             In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
impose the sanction agreed to in Respondent Dwyer’s Offer.  
              
             Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that:  
 
             Dwyer is suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant.   
 
 By the Commission.

       Secretary
