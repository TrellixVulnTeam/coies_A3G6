December 31, 2004, respectively.  Vital Health Technologies, Inc. dismissed the Firm as its

       2.       Todd W. Beutel, CPA (“Beutel”), age 42, is a certified public accountant

       The Commission may censure a person or  deny, temporarily or permanently, the

       found . . . to have willfully violated, or willfully aided and abetted the violation of 
       any provision of the Federal securities     laws or the rules and regulations

                                               2

Vital Health reported revenues of $5,500, and total assets of $1 million. 

       2.      Vital Health has at all relevant times been an issuer as defined by the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Act”). 

       3.      The Firm audited Vital Health’s 2003 financial statements included in Vital 
Health’s annual report for fiscal year 2003 on Form 10-KSB, filed with the Commission on April 
14, 2004.  As part of that audit, the Firm prepared and issued an audit report dated March 29, 
2004, which the company included in its 2003 Form 10-KSB.   

       4.      The Firm audited Vital Health’s 2004 financial statements included in Vital 
Health’s annual report for fiscal year 2004 on Form 10-KSB, filed with the Commission on April 
15, 2005.  As part of that audit, the Firm prepared and issued an audit report dated April 14, 2005 
(together with the March 29, 2004 audit report, the “Vital Health audit reports”), which the 
company included in its 2004 Form 10-KSB.  Vital Health paid the Firm a total of $22,000 for 
the 2003 and 2004 audit work. 4 

       5.      At the time the Firm issued the Vital Health audit reports, it was not registered 
with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the “Board”), as required by Section 
102(a) of the Act. 

       6.      Beutel was the engagement partner on the Firm’s audits of Vital Health’s 2003 
and 2004 financial statements.  Beutel participated in the preparation and issuance of the Vital 
Health audit reports. 

       7.      By public notice of disapproval dated July 28, 2005, effective as of May 10, 2005, 
the Board disapproved an application for registration submitted by the Firm based in part on the 
Firm’s violation of Section 102(a) of the Act in issuing the Vital Health audit reports.5 

C.     VIOLATIONS 

       1.      Section 102(a) of the Act provides that “it shall be unlawful for any person that is 
not a registered public accounting firm to prepare or issue, or to participate in the preparation or 
issuance of, any audit report with respect to any issuer.”6 

4 
       During the course of the Commission’s investigation, the Firm voluntarily reimbursed 
Vital Health the $22,000 in audit fees.  In view of the Firm’s reimbursement, the Commission is 
not ordering disgorgement in this matter. 
5 
       PCAOB Release No. 2005-017 (July 28, 2005).  The public notice of disapproval also 
found that the Firm’s issuance of the Vital Health audit reports violated Board Rule 2100, which 
implemented Section 102(a) of the Act.  Id. 
6 
       A violation of the Act or any rule that the Board issues under the Act is treated for all 
purposes in the same manner as a violation of the Exchange Act, including with respect to 
penalties.  Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 15 U.S.C.A. § 7202(b)(1) (West 2002).

       2.     The provisions of Section 102(a) of the Act became effective on October 22, 
2003.7 

       3.     Based on the conduct described above, the Firm willfully 8
                                                                        violated Section 102(a) 
of the Act. 

       4.     Based on the conduct described above, Beutel caused the Firm’s violation of 
Section 102(a) of the Act. 

D.     FINDINGS 

       Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that the Firm willfully violated Section 
102(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and that Beutel caused the Firm’s violation of Section 
102(a) of the Act. 

E.     UNDERTAKINGS 

       Respondents undertake not to request, demand, or accept, directly or indirectly, any 
compensation from Vital Health in connection with the audit work associated with the Vital 
Health audit reports.  In determining whether to accept the Offer, the Commission has considered 
this undertaking. 

                                              IV. 

       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in Respondents’ Offer. 

       Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that: 

       1.     Beutel Accountancy Corporation  

              A.      The Firm shall cease and desist from committing or causing any violations 
and any future violations of Section 102(a) of the Act. 

              B.      The Firm is censured.

       Section 102(a) became effective “[b]eginning 180 days after the date of the determination 
of the Commission under Section 101(d)” of the Act that the Board was prepared to undertake its 
statutory responsibilities.  The Commission made the required determination on April 25, 2003.  
See Order Regarding Section 101(d) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Securities Act Release 
No. 8223, Exchange Act Release No. 47746, 2003 WL 1956164  (Apr. 25, 2003). 
8 
       “Willfully” as used in this Offer means intentionally committing the act that constitutes 
the violation.  There is no requirement that the actor also be aware that he is violating a rule or 
statute.  See Wonsover v. SEC, 205 F.3d 408, 414 (D.C. Cir. 2000); Tager v. SEC, 344 F.2d 5, 8 
(2d Cir. 1965).
