                                     COMPLAINT 

      Plaintiff  Securities  and Exchange  Commission  ("Plaintiff'  or "Commission") alleges for 

its Complaint, as follows: 

                                      SUMMARY 

       1.    Ulticom,  Inc. (''Ulticom'' or the "Company")  engaged in two separate  fraudulent 

schemes through  which  it materially  misstated  its  financial results.  The  first  scheme  involved 

certain  improper  practices  in  connection  with  the  backdating of Ulticom· stock  options.  The 

second scheme involved improper accounting practices, including (i) the improper  establishment, 

maintenance,  and  release of reserves,  and  (ii) the  improper  recognition of revenue  on  certain 

inter-company shipments and service contracts. 

      2.     The misconduct  began in 1996, when Ulticom was a wholly-owned  subsidiary of 

Comverse  Technology,  Inc.. ("Comverse"),  and  continued  after  Ulticom  became  a  publicly­

traded  company, while still majority-owned by Comverse, in 2000. 

      3.     Between April 2000 and April 2004, Ulticom improperly recorded  the grant dates 

of eight· company-wide  grants of employee  stock  options.  On  four of those  eight  occasions, 

Ulticom backdated  the options  to coincide  with  near-term  lows in the  Company's  stock price. 
---------------------Page 2---------------------

,.
 

         On  these four  occasions,  the options were  "in-the-money,"  meaning  the  exercise  prices of the 

         backdated Ulticom options  were less than the Company's  stock price on the date the grants were 

         formally approved  by  Ulticom's  Stock Option Committee (the "Committee").  For the remaining 

         four of the irriproperly-recorded grants, the backdating resulted in the options being "out-of-the­

         money,"  meaning  the exercise prices  of these backdated  Ulticom  options  were higher  than the 

         Company's  stock prices on the dates the grants were  foiTIially approved by the Committee.  The 

         backdating  allowed the  Company to award  employees  disguised in-the-money  options  without 

         recording  a clrresponding  non-cash compensation  expense for the in':the-money portion    of the 

         option grant in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles  ("GAAP").  As 

         a result, Ulticom  (i) filed materially  false  and  misleading  financial  statements  that  materially 

         understated its compensation expenses and materially overstated its net income and earnings per 

         share  through  the  fiscal year ended  January  31,  2005,  and  (ii)  made  disclosures  in  certain 

         periodic filings and proxy statements during this time that falsely portrayed Ulticom's  options as 

         having been granted at exercise prices equal to the fair market value ofUlticom's   common stock 

         on the date of the grant. 

                 4.     Ulticom's  second scheme involved certain long-standing and improper accounting 

         practices that were  not in conformity with  GAAP.  From  1996 until    ~ts initial  public  offering 

         ("IPO")  in April 2000, Ulticom made improper  adjustments to its reserve  accounts  in order to 

         stockpile reserves.  In: its  first  fiscal year  following  its  IPO,  Ultic6m  released  some of these 

         improper excess reserves into income.  Without these releases, the Company would not have met 

         Wall  Street  analysts'  earnings  estimates.  In addition,  from  1998  to  April  2001,  Ulticom 

         improperly  deferred  to subsequent periods  the recognition of revenues  from  certain  shipments 

         and service contracts between itself and another subsidiary   of Comverse.  As a result, Ulticom 

                                                          2

                     ·                                              . 
filed materially fa1~e and misleading financial  statements that misstated the Company's  revenues, 

expenses, liabilities, net income, and earnings per share through the fiscal year ended January 31, 

2004. 

       5.     At   the  time of  its  IPO  in  April  2000,  Ulticom  included  in  its  registration· 

statements financial statements and related disclosures that were materially false and misleading 

asa result ofthe Company's improper accounting practices.  At the time    of its follow-on offering . 

in  October  2000,  Ulticom  included  in  its  registration  statements  financial  statements  and 

disclosures thr  were materially  false  and misleading  as a result of both  the improper  options 

backdating and other improper accounting practices described herein. 

       6.      Ulticom  has  announced  that  its  historical  financial  statements  and  any  related 

reports of its  independent  registered  public  accounting  firm  should  no  longer be  relied  upon. 

Ulticom  has announced that it will restate  its historical  financial statements  for its fiscal years 

ended December 31, 1996 ("Fiscal Year 1996") through January 31, 2005 ("Fiscal Year 2004"), 

in order to record additional material non-cash charges for option-related compensation expenses 

and to correct the material misstatement of its revenues and earnings. 

       7.      By  engaging  in  the  foregoing  conduct,  Ulticom  violated  Section  17(a) of the 

Securities  Act of 1933  ("Securities  Act") [15U.S.C.    § 77q(a)),  Sections 13 (a), 13(b)(2)(A), 

13(b)(2)(B), and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange  Act  of 1934 ("Exchange  Act'?) [15 U.S.c.   §§ 

78m(a), 78m(b)(2)(A), 78m(b)(2)(B), and 78n(a))  and Exchange Act Rules  13a-l,  13a-11, 13a­

13, and 14a-9 [17 C.F.R.  §§ 240.13a~I,  240.13a-ll,  240.13a-13, and 240. 14a-9).  An  injunction 

is necessary to ensure that Ulticom will not continue to· violate the foregoing provisions   of the 

federal securities laws.

                                JURISDICTION       AND VENUE
 

       8.      The  Court  has  jurisdiction  over  this  action  pursuant  to. Section  22(a) of the 

Securities  Act  [15 U.S.c.§ 77v(a)]and  Sections  21(d), 21(e), and 27 of the Exchange  Act  [15 

U.S.c. §§ 78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa]. 

       9. ..   Defendant Ulticom; directly  or indirectly, used the means  and instrumentalities of 

interstate  commerce,  or of the  mails,  or  the  facilities of a  national  securities  exchange in 

connection with the acts, transactions, practices  and courses ofbusiness alleged herein. 

       10.    tV enue is proper in this District  because certain ofthe·acts, transactions, practices 

and  courses of business  alleged  herein  took  place  in  the  Eastern  District of New  York  and 

Ulticom's  parent  company,  Comverse,  was  headquartered  and/or  maintained  an  office  in 

Woodbury, New York at all relevant times. 

                                      THE   DEFENDANT 

       11.     Defendant  Ulticom,   Inc. is  a  New  Jersey  corporation  based  in  Mount  Laurel, 

New  Jersey,  that  provides  service-enabling  signaling  software  for  fixed,  mobile,  and  internet 

communications.  Ulticom was  a wholly-owned  subsidiary      of Comverse  until its IPO in April 

2000;  it  has  been  a  majority-owned  subsidiary of Comverse  since  April  2000.   Ulticom's 

common  stock was registered  with the  Commission  pursuantto  Section  12(b)   of the Exchange 

Act and traded  on the NASDAQ  Global  Market.  Trading in Ulticom  stock was suspended  on 

February  1, 2007, and the stock was eventually delisted, due to Ulticom's  failure to file timely its 

fiscal  2005  annual  report  on  Form  10-K  and  fiscal  2006  quarterly  reports  on  Forms  10-Q. 

Ulticom  has  not  filed  periodic  reports  on  Forms  10-K  or  10-Q  with  the  Commission  since 

December  2005.  Currently  Ulticom' s  stock  is  registered  with  the  Commission  pursuant  to 

                                                4

                                              RELATED PARTY 

                 12.    Comverse  Technology,  Inc.,  a New York corporation which at all relevant  tirries 

         was based  in Woodbury,  New York, makes  software systems  and provides  related services for 

         multimedia  communication  and information  processing  applications.  Comverse  is  the  parent 

         company and majority  shareholder   of Ulticom  and, at various times relevant to this Complaint, 

         former  Comvfrse  executives  and board  members  also  served  as former  ex.ecutives and board 

         members ofUlticom.  Specifically, Comverse's  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") 

         was  Chairman    of Ulticom's  board   of directors  from  October  1997  until  May   1, 2006. 

         Comverse's  Chief  Financial  Officer  ("CFO")  was  Ulticom's  CFO  from  December  1999  to 

         September 2001, and a Director from April 2000 to May     1, 2006 (hereinafter referred to as the 

         "Former  CFO").  Comverse's  General  Counsel  was the  Corporate  Secretary  and a Director of 

         Ulticom  from  at  least  2000  until  June  2004.  He  also  served  on  several  board  committees, 

         including Ulticom's  Compensation Committee, and provided legal services to Ulticom through a 

         services agreement between Comverse and Ulticom. 

                                                     FACTS 

                 A.     Ulticom's  Backdating  of Stock  Options 

                 13.    Ulticom  used  employee  stock  options  as a  form of compensation  to  recruit, 

         incentivize and retain key employees, as did many other companies at the time.  Between April 

         2000 and April 2004, however, four   of Ulticom's  backdated  stock option grants resulted in the 

         award   of disguised  in-the-money  options  to  employees of the  Company.   Ulticom  did  not 

                                                        5
 
---------------------Page 6---------------------

disclose the in-the-money  status nor record  the corresponding  non-cash  compensation  expenses 

for the in-the-moneyportion  of these option grants in conformity with GAAP. 

       14.     As a result, Ulticom filed materially  false and misleading financial statements that 

materially understated  its  compensation  expenses  and materially  overstated  its net income  and 

earnings per  share through  the fiscal  year  ended  January  31, 2005.  The  Company  also made 

disclosures in certain periodic filings and proxy statements during this time that falsely portrayed 

Ulticom's  options  as having  been  granted  at exercise  prices  equal to the  fair market  value of 

Ulticom's coron     stock on the date ofthe grant. 

               1.     The Ulticom Stock Option Plan 

       15.     Since going public in 2000, and continuing to June 2005, UIticom granted options 

to  its  employees  and  employee-directors  pursliant  to  the  Company's  1998  Stock  Incentive 

Compensation  Plan  ("Plan"),  which  was  amended  effective  January  20,  2000.  The  Plan was 

drafted by Comverse'sGeneral  Counsel and was approved       by Ultic:om's board  of directors and 

voted upon by its shareholders. 

       16.     The  stated  purpose of Ulticom's  Plan  was  to  attract  and  retain  employees  and 

directors at Ulticom  and its subsidiaries by giving those  persons "a greater stake in [Ulticom's] 

success and a closer  identity  with  it."  The Plan  gave UIticom's  Stock  Option  Committee  the 

power to interpret and administer the Plan and the authority:  (i) to select the specific employees 

to whom  awards would  be granted;  (ii) to  determine  the type  and amount  of  the  award to be 

granted such employees;  and (iii) to determine the terms of the option agreements to be entered 

into  with  such  employees.  In practice,  the· Committee  approved an  option  grant  based  on  a 

master list of grantees compiled  by Ulticom's  management.  The Plan expressly prohibited the 

award of incentive stock options at less than the fair market value ofa share ofcommon stock on 

                                                6
 
---------------------Page 7---------------------

      ,; 
" 

          the date of grant.  "Fair market value" was defined  as the mean between  the highest and lowest 

          sale price of Ulticom  common  stock   on the principal  national  securities  exchange  on which  it 

          was listed on the date ofthe grant. 

                         2.     The  Ulticom Bylaws 

                 17.     Ulticom's  bylaws,  effective from March  2000 to the present,  make  clear that the 

          Committee can formally act upon stock option grant proposals in two ways.  The Committee can 

          act without  a formal meeting, if all members  consent  in writing  to the adoption of a resolution 

          authorizing t,e  action  (i.e.,  the  consent  must be unanimous),  or  the  Committee  can  act by 

          holding  a meeting  at which  a quorum  of Committee members  is present,   if a majority of those 

          present at the meeting approve the action. 

                         3.     The  Ulticom Option    Grant  Process 

                 18.     Beginning  in 2000,  and continuing  until  April  2004,  Ulticom  made  eight  stock 

          option  grants  in  which  the  grant  dates  preceded  the  date  on  which  Ulticom's  Stock  Option 

          Committee  had  formally  acted   to approve  the  grant  proposals.   The  exercise  price of  the 

          underlying  options  did  not  reflect  the  "fair  market  value"  on  the  date  when  the  Committee 

          formally acted to approve such grants, and,  by the time the Committee did formally  act, options 

          underlying  four of the  grants  were  in-the-money.   The  in-the.;.money portion of these  grants 

          should have  been,  but  was  not,  recorded as a compensation  expense  on  Ulticom's  books  and 

          records or reflected in Ulticom's  financial statements. 

                 19.     Ulticom's   options-grant   process   connnenced   with   Ulticom   executives 

          approaching the Former CFO or Comverse's  CEO to obtain authorization  to initiate a grant.  As 

          part of that  initial  contact  regarding  initiation of a  grant  or  shortly  thereafter,  Ulticom's 

          executives  and. employees  would  forward  to  the  Former  CFO  or  Comverse's  CEO  a  list   of 

                                                          7
 
---------------------Page 8---------------------

proposed· grantees  along with the proposed number   of shares to be granted to each.  If a grant 

was  detennined  to be  appropriate, the Former CFO then instructed  certain  Ulticom  executives 

and employees to review  the Company's  historical  stock prices  and select  a date on which the 

stock was trading  at a low price.  These individuals  typically looked back  a week or two and 

presented  the  Former  CFO  with  the  lowest  closing  price  during  the  look-back  period.  The 

Former CFO approved a grant date based on the information provided. 

       20.    A  master  list of proposed  option  grantees,  which  identified  for  each  person  a 

proposed n,ber    of options to be granted, tYPiC~llY then was forw~rded to Comverse for review 

and, sometimes, revision. 

       21.    While  the  master  list of grantees  was  being  reviewed,  Ulticom  executives  and 

employees prepared a Unanimous Written Consent, based on a template provided by Comverse's 

General  Counsel,  to  be  forwarded  to  and  signed by all members of Ulticom's  Stock  Option· 

Committee  in  order  to  approve  the  grant.  These  individuals  inserted  into  each  Unanimous 

Written  Consent  an "as of' date that was the  date  that had been  selected  using the  look-back 

procedure  at  the  outset of the  grant  process,  instead of the  date  when  the  Committee  had 

approved the  grant.  Following  approval of  the  Unanimous  Written  Consents  by  Comverse's 

General  Counsel  and  approval  of the  master  list of grantees by CBmverse, the  Unanimous 

Written Consents were forwarded to the Committee for signature. 

       22.    The Former  CFO, General  Counsel,  and certain former Ulticom  executives  and 

individuals knew that the "as of' date reflected in each Unanimous Written Consent - which, in 

turn, determined the exercise price for the underlying  options - not only preceded  the date on 

which the Committee had acted on the option grant proposal, it also preceded  the date on which 

anyone had even begun to prepare the Unanimous Written Consents. 

                                               8

" 

                 23.    illtimately,  for the eight option grants made by Ulticom between April 2000 and 

         April 2004, a Unanimous Written Consent and    masterlist of proposed grantees was forwarded to 

         each  member   of Ulticom's  Stock  Option  Committee  for  review  and  signature.  Committee 

         members signed their individual copies  ofthe Unanimous Written Consents ana retUrned them to 

         Ulticom  where they subsequently  were forwarded  to Comverse's  General Counsel for filing as 

         corporate records.  The Committee  acted upon option grant proposals during this period solely 

         through Unanimous Written Consents. 

                 24.   t~one  of the  Unanimous  Written  Consents  that  were signed  in connectio~ with 

         'stock option grants between April 2000 and April 2004 identified the specific dates on which any 

         Committee  members  had signed  them.  None    of the Unanimous  Written  Consents  during that 

         period identified the date on which any stock option grant had been approved by the Cominittee. 

         The sole date reflected on the Unanimous  Written Consents  was the   "as of' date that had been 

         approved  by the Former CFO and that preceded any  Committee action. 

                 25.    Ulticom  changed  its  options-grant  practices in or  around  April  2004,  at which 

         point  Ulticom  adopted  the  practice of recording  a  grant  date  only  after  receipt of signed 

         Unanimous Written Consents from all Committee members. 

                         4.	   Ulticom's Materially Misleading Financials And 
                               Disclosures Resulting From Its Options Practices 

                 26.    Options underlying four  of the eight grants made by illticom  between April 2000 

         and April 2004 were in-the-money  on the date when Ulticom's  Stock Option Committee  acted 

         upon the grant proposals. 

                 27.    The four  grants were  in-the-money, by the  following  amounts per option, when 

         the Committee acted upon the grant proposals: 

                                                         9

   Because it stated in its public filings that it accounted for its options during the relevant period in 

   confonnity  with Accounting  Principles  Board Opinion No: 25, "Accounting  for Stock Issued to 

   Employees,"  ~'APB   25"), Ulticom waS  required to record a compensation  expense in connection 

   with these four grants overthe four-year vesting period ofthe options. It did not do so. 

          28.     As  a result of the  foregoing  acts, Ulticom  materially  overstated  its net  income· 

   and earnings  per .share for  fiscal  years  ended-January  31,  2001  ("Fiscal  Year  2000")  through 

   January  31,  2005  ("Fiscal  Year  2004").   Ulticom's  overstatement,  as  a  percentage  of its 

   previously-reported  pre-tax income, ranged from as little as 2.7% to as much  as 16.3% between 

   Fiscal Years 2000 and 2004. 

          29.     UlticoIh issued quarterly earnings press releases,  which contained materially  false 

 . and  misleading  fmancial  results,  in  current  reports  filed  with  the  Commission  on	 Fonn 8-K 

   between June 2003 and December 2005.  Ulticomknew  or       was  reckless in not knowing that the 

   net  income  and  earnings  figures  reported  in  such  documents  were  materially  false  and 

   misleading as a result of its improper options-grant practices. 

          30.     Ulticom  published  (or  incorporated   by  reference)  its  materially  false  and 

   misleading  fmancial results  for Second  Quarter 2000 in, among  other documents  filed with  the 

   COinmission, its registration  statement  on Fonn S-l  and  offering  prospectus  for its  follow-on 

   offering,  pursuant  to  which  it (and  certain of its  and  Comverse's  executives)  sold  4,250,000

shares of common stock at $50 per share in October 2000.  Ulticom knew or was reckless in not 

knowing  that the net income  and earnings figures reported   in such documents  were  materially 

false and misleading as a result ofits improper options-grant practices. 

       31.     The Form   S-1 and related prospectus for Ulticom's  follow-on offering in October 

2000 also contained materially  false and misleading  disclosures  about Ulticom's  stock  option­

grant practices and accounting.  There, less than two months after the grant dated "as of' July 10, 

2000, Ulticom made the following materially misleading statements in three separate sections     of 

its registratiOI, statement and prospectus: 

       The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.        25,  'Accounting 
       For Stock Issued to Employees,'  and related interpretations   in accounting  for its 
       option  plans.  Accordingly,  as  all options  have  been  granted  at  exercise  prices 
       equal to fair market value on the date of grant, no compensation expense has been  . 
       recognized  by  the  Company  in  connection  with  its  stock-based  compensation 
       plans. 

                                          *   *   *   *   * 

       Options which are designated as "incentive stock options" under the option plans 
       may be  granted with an exercise price not less than the fair market  value   of the 
       underlying shares at the date of grant and are subject to certain quantity and other 
       limitations specified in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code. 

                                          *  *   *   * * 

       The price per share at which common stock may be purchased upon exercise       of an 
       option is detennined by the committee; however, in the case   of grants of incentive 
       stock options, the price per share may not be less than the fair market value of a 
       share of common stock on the date   of grant. 

       32.     Ulticom made additional materially misleading disclosures about its options-grant 

process in its proxy statements on Form DEF 14A, filed with the Commission on May 10,2002 

and May 16, 2003.  Specifically, with respect to options that Ulticom had granted to certain  of its 

executives in the "last fiscal year," Ulticom  falsely represented that "[t]he  exercise price of the 

options is equal to the fair market value ofthe underlying shares at the date ofgrant."  The grants 

                                                11
 
---------------------Page 12---------------------

referred to - the March 5, 2001 and June 25, 2002 grants - in fact were in-the-money on the date 

of Committee  approval  and   the exercise  prices of the  underlying  optimis  did  not  reflect  fair 

market  value.  Ulticom  knew,  or  was  reckless  in  not  knowing,  that  these  disclosures in the 

proxies  and  registration  statements  were  materially  false  and  misleading  because    of  its 

backdating  practices. 

       33.     By  virtue of the  stock  options  backdating,  Ulticom's  books  and records  falsely 

and  inaccurately  reflected;  among  other  things,  the  compensation  and  income  tax  expense 

associated wi,   the  Company's- grants  of  stock  options  to  its  emPlOyees: the  Company's  net 

income  and  earnings  per  share,  and  its  general  financial  condition.   Ulticom  also  failed  to 

maintain  a system of internal  accounting  controls  sufficient  to provide  assurances that its stock 

option grants were recorded as necessary to permit the proper preparation   of fmancial statements 

in conformity with GAAP. 

       B.      Ulticom's  Reserve   and Revenue  Recognition  Practices 

        34.    Pre-dating  Ulticom's  stock options backdating  practices,  and continuing  through 

at  least  January  31,  2002  ("Fiscal  Year  200I"), Ulticom  engaged  in  improper  accounting, 

including  (i)  the  improper  creation,  maintenance  and  use  of  reserves  from  1996  through 

Ulticom's  fiscal quarter ending October 31, 2001 ("Third  Quarter 20OJ");and  (ii) the improper 

deferral of  revenues  on  certain  transactions  between  Ulticom  and  another  subsidiary     of 

Comverse,  Comverse  Network  System's  Israeli  Division  ("CNS-Israel"  or  "Comverse  Ltd."), 

between  1998 and April 2001. 

        35.    Ulticom filed materially false and misleading  financial statements, including those 

that  were  incorporated  into  registration  statements  for  the  Company's  IPO  and  follow-on 

offerings, that misstated the Company's  revenues,  expenses, liabilities, net income, and earnings 

                                                12
 
---------------------Page 13---------------------

per share through Fiscal Year 2003.  Although theseimproper practices ceased     by late 2001, they 

continued  to cause Ulticom's  reported  financials  to be misstated  in subsequent  fiscal  years,  up 

through Fiscal Year 2004. 

               1.      Ulticom's Improper  Reserves Practices 

       36.     Beginning  in  1996  and  continuing  through  Third  Quarter  2001,  Ulticom 

improperly  added  reserves  to  its  books  and  records  and/or  maintained  reserves  that  were  no 

longer needed  in periods .when it performed  above  expectations.   It released  reserves during  at 

least one fiscal year when it performed below expectations. 
              t  . 
       37.     Specifically, under the direction of the Former  CFO and other formerexecutives, 

Ulticommaintained  and routinely  updated  spreadsheets  that tracked  its revenues  and earnings. 

The spreadsheet  that tracked Ulticom's  revenues  was entitled  "Rev Proj."  The spreadsheet  that 

tracked  Ulticom's  earnings  was  known  among  Ulticom  executives  as  the  "cancer  table." 

Together these spreadsheets  enabled Ulticom  quickly to identify gaps between  actual results and 

projected  results  and Wall Street  analyst  estimates  as each quarter  and year progressed,  and to 

make adjustments (including adjustments  to reserve balances)  as necessary to lessen or close the 

gap. 

       38.Ulticom       also tracked  its  reserve  balances  (and reservt<. usage)  on  a spreadsheet 
                      .                                                                  .        . 
entitled  "Accruals-Buffers."  The spreadsheet - updated on a monthly  (and later quarterly) basis 

- listed for each reserve the reserve balance  (in one column)  and the amount  of the balance  that 

was  excess  and thus  available  for release  (in  an  adjacent  column).  The  excess  amounts  were 

denoted either as "buffer" or "amount  excess." 

      . 39.    During Ulticom's  quarter-end  and year-end  closing processes,  Ulticom's  Former 

CFOand    other  former  executives  directed  the  accounting  staff  to make  upward  or downward 

                                                13
 
---------------------Page 14---------------------

..; 

   adjustments to Ulticom's  reserve levels, as necessary,  either to stockpile reserves in the event an 

   earnings  boost  was  needed  in  the  future or to  close  the  gap  between  Ulticom' s  actual  and 

   projected earnings. 

          40.     Such adjustments, for the most part, were unrelated to the underlying liability for 

  which  any  reserve  had  initially  been  created  and  did  not  comport  with  GAAP,  including 

   Statement  of Financial Accounting Standards  No.5,   Accounting for Contingencies  ("SFAS 5"), 

   at ~ 8, or Accounting  Principles Board Opinion No. 20, Accounting  Changes    ("APE   20"), at ~~ 

   13 and 36-38. t 

          41.     In September 2001, a new CFO arrived     at Ulticom,  and the Company undertook 

   to reverse  a number  of its  excess reserve  balanc.es during the quarter  ended  January  31, 2002 

   ("Fourth  Quarter 2001").  However, the reversals  were not done in conformity with GAAP and 

   Ulticom did not release the excess balances into the proper historical period.  In addition, certain 

   excess  reserves  remained  on Ulticom's  books  and records  in  each  period  through  the  end of 

   Fiscal Year 2004. 

          2.      Ulticom's Improper Deferral    of Revenues 

          42.     Beginning  in  1998  and  continuing  through  April  2001,  Ulticom  engaged  in 

   improper  revenue  recognition  practices  with  respect  to  contracts  between  it  and  Comverse 

   subsidiary  CNS-Israel, in an effort to smooth  revenues and demonstrate  steady (as opposed  to 

   volatile and unsustainable) revenue growth to investors. 

          43.     The  improper  and  unsupported  revenue  deferrals  involved  inter-company 

   shipments  between  Ulticom  and  eNS-Israel.   The  Former  CFO  and  other  former  executives 

   directed that problems be fabricated to prohibit  the acceptance of products by CNS-Israel when 

   in reality no  such problems  existed, or, if the products  had already been  shipped, Ulticom  and 

                                                   14
 
---------------------Page 15---------------------

                                    ·                                 . 
CNS-Israel  agreed  to  delay  the  recording of invoices  on  their  books  and records;   Also, on 

occasion,  the Fonner  CFO and other fonner  executives  directed that Ulticom  ask CNS-Israel  to 

delay  making  payments  for  services  that  Ulticom  had  perfonned on behalf of eNS-Israel  for 

third parties. 

       44.     By  engaging  in such practices,  Ulticom  violated  its own long-standing  policy of 

recognizing  revenue on the date that the product was shipped to the customer, which also was the 

date on which Ulticom was required to invoice the customer.    In addition, these practices did not 

confonn  withFAAP,    i~clUding  Statement of Financial Accounting ,concepts   No.5,  Recognition 

and Measurement  in Financial Statements   ofBusiness  Enterprises ("SFAC5"),    at ~ 83. 

       45.     As a result of these revenue recognition  practices,  Ulticom materially  understated 

its revenues  and pre-tax earnings  in Fiscal Year  1998 and it overstated  its revenues  and pre-tax 

earnings in Fiscal Years 1999,2000  and 2001: 

               1998         $ (1,162,500)             $ (838~700)            (33.63) % 
               1999            $ 229,500                 $ 67,100              2.64  % 
               2000           .$ 623,000                $ 461,600              3.15  % 
               2001            $ 310,000                $ 310,000              1.79  % 

       46.     Ulticom  published  (or  incorporated  by  reference)  these  materially  false  and 

misleading  financial  results  for Fiscal  Years  1998  and  1999 in,  among  other  documents  filed 

with  the Commission,  its registration  statements on Form S-1  and offering  prospectuses  for its' 

IPO and follow-on offering. 

                                                15
 
---------------------Page 16---------------------

        47.    Further, because the impact   ofUlticom's   revenue recognition practices from these 

periods  remained  on  the  Company's  books  arid records  in  subsequent  fiscal  periods, lnticom 

.materially misstated its revenues, net  income and earnings per share through Fiscal Year 2001. 

        48.     As a result of these improper revenue recognition  practices,  Ulticom's  books  and 

records  falsely  and  inaccurately  reflected  the  Company's  revenues,  net  income,  earnings  per 

share  and the  Company's  general  financial  condition.  Also  by  virtue of its improper  revenue 

recognition  practices,  Ulticom  failed  to  maintain  a  system  of internal  accounting  controls 

sufficient  to rovide   assurances  that its  accruals,  reserves,  and  revenue  were  recorded  as 

necessary to permit the proper preparation  of financial statements in conformity with GAAP.
                                                                    -                    , 
        3.      Ulticom's  Public  Stock  Offerings 

                       3.      IPO 

        49.     On or about  AprilS,  2000, Ulticom  commenced  its initial public offering  of 4.25 

million shares of common stock at a price    of $13 per share. In connection with its IPO, Ulticom 

filed  a registration  statement  on  Form S-1 and  a prospectus,  which  included  audited  financial 

statements for Ulticom' s fiscal years ending January  31, 1998 ("Fiscal Year  1997"), January 31, 

1999  ("Fiscal  Year  1998")  and  January  31,  2000  ("Fiscal  Year  1999").   The  registration 

statement and prospectus  also included unaudited  financials  for Fiscal ¥'ear 1996.  This was the 

first time  that  the  public  had  been  provided  with  Ulticom-specific  earnings  data,  its  financial
                   .               .           . 

results having been consolidated with those   ofits parent (Comverse) prior  to that time. 

        50.    In  Fiscal Years  1996,  1997, and  1999 Ulticomestablishedunnecessary       reserves 

and inflated existing reserves. fu Fiscal Year 1998, Ulticom improperly took some      of the excess 

amounts in its reserve accounts into income. 

                                                 16
 
---------------------Page 17---------------------

.' 

           51.     These  improper  reserve  practices  caused  Ulticom  to  report,  in the  registration 

   statement  on Form  S-1 and prospectus  for its  lPO,  the following  materially  misleading  earnings 

   and loss amounts: 

             1996            $      (1,577,000)                $  (0.05) 
             1997            $        2,055,000                $   0.06 
             Jan. 1998       $        (431,000)                $  (0.01) 
             1998            $'       1,567,000                $   0.05 
             1999'           $        1,574,000                $   0.05 

   Ulticom   therety falsely presented  itself  as having  achieved  steady  earnings  on a per share basis 

   for the three years leading up to its IPO, when,  in fact, its actual results had been more volatile. 

           52.     After  the  close of Fiscal  Year  1998,  Ulticom  deferred  a  substantial  amount of 

   revenues  into  Fiscal  Year  1999 to  smooth  its top-line  results.  In Fiscal  Years  1999  and 2000, 

   Ulticom overstated its revenues. 

           53..    Ulticom  knew   or was reckless  in not knowing  that the historical  earnings  and loss 

   amounts  reported   in its  IPO  Form  S-1  registration  statement  and  prospectus  were  materially 

   misleading  as a result of its improper reserve and revenue recognition  practices. 

                           b.      Follow-On Offering 

           54.     On or about October   ,17, 2000, Ulticom  commenced  its follow-on  offering   of 4.25 

   million  shares of  common  stock  at  a price of  $50  per  share.  In  connection  with  its  offering, 

   Ulticom  filed  a registration  statement on Form  S-1  and a prospectus,  which  included  the  same 

   materially misleading  financials  that Ulticom had included  in its IPO registration  statement - i.e., 

   Fiscal  Year  1996  (unaudited)  and  Fiscal  Years  1997  through  1999  (audited)  - and  it  added 

   unaudited  financials  for the  six month  period  ending  July  31, 2000  ("First  and Second  Quarter 

   2000"). 

                                                     17 
---------------------Page 18---------------------

       55.     For the First  and Second  Quarters  of 2000,  as a result of its continued  improper 

reserve practices, Ulticom  reported materially  :rll.isleading cumulative  earnings of $2,677,000  (or 

$0.07 diluted EPS). 

       56.     Ulticom knew or was reckless  in not knowing that the historical  earnings and loss 

amounts reported in the Form S-1 registration  statement for its follow-on offering and prospectus 

were materially misleading  as a result ofits improper reserve and revenue recognition practices. 

       57.     Ulticom issued quarterly earnings press releases, which contained materially  false 

and misleadur    fmancial  results,  in  current  reports  filed  with  the  Commission  on  Form  8-K 

between  June  2003  and  December    2a05.  Through  actions   dir~cted by  its  former  executives, 

Ulticom knew   or was reckless  in not knowing  that the net income  and earnings  figures reported 

in such  documents  were materially  false and misleading  as a result of its improper  reserve  and 

revenue recognition practices.

and  inaccurately  reflected,  among  other  things,  the  Company's  net  income  and  earnings  per 

share,  and its general  financial  condition.  Ulticom  also failed to maintain  a system of internal 

accounting  controls  sufficient  to  provide  assurances  that  its  reserve  activity  was  recorded  as 

necessary to permit the proper preparation  offinancial statements  in conformity with GAAP.
