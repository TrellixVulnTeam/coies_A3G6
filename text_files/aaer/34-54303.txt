                                                 I. 
 
              The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) deems it appropriate and in the 
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against Joseph 
A. Rougraff (Respondent or R ougraff) pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(i) of the Commissions 
Rules of Practice.1
                      
                                                   
                                                 II. 
 
              In anticipation of the institution of these  proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the Offer) whic h the Commission has determined   to accept.  Solely for the 
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings 
herein, except as to the Commissions jurisd  iction over him and the subject matter of these 
                                                 
1
 Rule 102(e)(3)(i) provides, in relevant part, that: 
 
                 The Commission, with due regard to the public interest and without preliminary hearing, may, by order, . . . 
suspend from appearing or practicing before it any . . . accountant . . . who has been by name . . . permanently 
enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction, by reason of his or her misconduct in an action brought by the 
Commission, from violating or aiding and abetting the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or of 
the rules and regulations thereunder.

proceedings, and the findings contained in Section III. 3. below, which are admitted, Respondent 
consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Rule 102(e) 
of the Commissions Rules of Practice, Maki  ng Findings, and Imposi ng Remedial Sanctions 
(Order), as set forth below.   
 
                                              III. 
 
              On the basis of this Order and Respondents Offer, the Commission finds that:  
 
       1.          Rougraff, age 47, is a CPA licensed in th  e State of Indiana.  He served as vice 
president, CFO, and corporate secretary of Virbac Corporation (Virbac) from May 2000 until he 
resigned effective January 27, 2004.   
        
       2.           Virbac, a Delaware corporation headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, is the result of 
the March 1999 acquisition of Agri-Nutrition Group Limited (AGNU), a publicly-held company, 
by Virbac Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vi rbac S.A., a French vete rinary pharmaceutical 
manufacturer.  Virbac is a manufacturer and distributor of animal health products.  Virbacs 
common stock is registered with the Commission under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and trades in th e Pink Sheets under the symb ol VBAC since it 
was delisted from the NASDAQ National Market on January 23, 2004 for Virbacs failure to file 
timely its periodic reports. 
        
       3.          On August 4, 2006 , a final judgment was entered against Rougraff, permanently 
enjoining him from future violations of Section 17(a) of the S ecurities Act of 1933 and Sections 
10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder, 
and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange 
Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder,  and imposing an officer and director bar in 
the civil action entitled Securities and Exchange Commission v. Virbac Corp., et. al, Civil Action 
Number 4:06-CV-0453-A, in the United States District Court for the  Northern District of Texas.  
Rougraff was also ordered to pay $26,668 in disgorgement and $5,656 in prejudgment interest, and 
a $100,000 civil money penalty. 
 
       4. The Commissions complain         t alleged, among other things, that from December 
2000 to November 2003, Virbac engaged in a revenue inflation and expense deferral scheme and 
that Rougraff participated in the scheme.  According to the complaint, the scheme involved the 
improper recognition of revenue by means of       channel-stuffing, or loading of product to 
distributors, by recording revenue from sham     transactions, and by recording revenue from 
transactions occurring after period-end.  The Commission also alleges in the complaint that, as a 
result of the scheme, Virbac met unrealistic reve  nue and earnings projections and managed to 
sustain the illusion of rapid growthby fraudulently inflating its revenues and net income by as 
much as 9% and 694%, respectively and that, in      the process, Virbac   failed to comply with 
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAA P).  The Commission further alleges that 
Rougraff failed to cause Virbac to record appropriate reserves and accruals to overstate earnings; 
that in furtherance of the scheme , Virbac personnel falsely documented terms of transactions on 
invoices and other underlying documents; and that the true terms were established in side 

                                               2

arrangements, per conversations and e-mails, whic  h Rougraff and others   failed to disclose to 
Virbacs auditors. 
            
                                                                         IV. 
                                                                            
           In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
impose the sanction agreed to in Respondent Rougraffs Offer. 
 
           Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effectiv e immediately, that Rougraff is suspended 
from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant.   
 
 By the Commission.
