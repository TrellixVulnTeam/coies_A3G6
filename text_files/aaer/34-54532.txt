brought by or on behalf of the Commission, or to which the Co mmission is a party, and without 
admitting or denying the findings  herein, except as to the Commissions jurisdiction over him and 
the subject matter of these proceedings, which     are admitted, and the   findings contained in 
paragraph 3 below, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting 
Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Rule 1  02(e) of the Commission s Rules of Practice, 
Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (Order), as set forth below.   
 
                                               III. 
 
              On the basis of this Order and Respondents Offer, the Commission finds that:  
 
        1. DeLoach, age              47, is a certified public accountant licensed to practice in the 
State of Florida.  He served as Controller of The PBSJ Corp. (PBSJ or the company) from 1992 
to 2004, and as PBSJs Chief Financial Officer from 2004, until his resignation in March 2005. 
        
                     2.          PBSJ is an employee-o wned Florida corporation with its principal place of 
business in Miami, Florida.  PBSJ provides a broad range of planning, designing, and construction 
services to a variety of public and private sector  clients related to transportation, environmental, 
civil engineering, and construction management.  Since 2000, PBSJs common stock was registered 
with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange 
Act).   
        
                     3.           On September 15, 2006, the Commission filed a complaint against DeLoach 
in SEC v. William Scott DeLoach, et al.  (Case No. 06-22329-CIV-GOLD) in the United States 
District Court for the Southern District of Flor ida.  On September 19, 2006, the court entered an 
order permanently enjoining DeLoach, by consent,  from future violations of Sections 10(b) and 
13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder, and aiding 
and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b )(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and 
Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder.  
 
     4. The Commissions co                 mplaint alleged, among other things, that, over the 
 course of 13 years, DeLoach, with the assistance of two other PBSJ employees, embezzled more 
 than $35 million of PBSJ funds.      This fraudulent scheme re  sulted in numerous, material 
 inaccuracies in PBSJs financial statements and the impending restatements by the company of 
 its financial statements for up to the past si x years.  The complaint alleged that DeLoach 
 knowingly falsified PBSJs books and records in an effort to conceal the massive theft and that, 
 from 2004 through the first fiscal quarter of   2005, he certified several of PBSJs annual and 
 quarterly reports filed by PBSJ with the Commission that contained material misrepresentations 
 as a result of his fraud.  DeLoach also signed management representation letters to PBSJs public 
 auditors from several years, affirming that  there had been no fraud at the company involving 
 management.

             In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
impose the sanction agreed to in Respondent DeLoachs Offer. 
 
             Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that: 
 
             DeLoach is suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an 
accountant.  
 
 By the Commission.
