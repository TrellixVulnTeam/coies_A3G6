                                              I.  
 
       The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the 
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against Marc E. 
Bercoon (“Respondent” or “Bercoon”) pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(i) of the Commission’s Rules of  
Practice.1 
           
                                                

                                                 
1
 Rule 102(e)(3)(i) provides, in relevant part, that: 
 
       The Commission, with due regard to the public interest and without preliminary hearing, 
may, by order, . . . suspend from appearing or practicing before it any . . . attorney, [or] 
accountant . . . who has been by name . . . permanently enjoined by any court of competent 
jurisdiction, by reason of his or her misconduct in an action brought by the Commission, from  
violating or aiding and abetting the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or of 
the rules and regulations thereunder.

                                               II.  
 
       In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the 
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings 
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these 
proceedings, and the findings contained in Section III.3. below, which are admitted, Respondent 
consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Rule 102(e) 
of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions 
(“Order”), as set forth below.   
 
                                              III.  
 
       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that:  
 
              1.      Marc E. Bercoon, 50,  has been an attorney who was licensed to practice law 
in the State of Illinois until 2008, and has held himself out as a Certified Public Accountant, or as 
having passed the CPA examination.  Bercoon has held various positions with public companies, 
including General Counsel and Secretary of one public company from February 1993 to February 
1994, and Senior Vice President beginning in February 1994; Chief Financial Officer and 
President of another public company from February 28, 2005, to April 28, 2005, and from April 
28, 2005, to June 6, 2006, respectively; and Assistant Secretary for a third public company as of 
March 25, 2005. 
        
              2.      LADP Acquisition, Inc. (“LADP”) is a Delaware corporation located in 
Atlanta, Georgia.  Bercoon exercised control over this company.  On January 8, 2010, the State of 
Pennsylvania issued a cease and desist order against LADP to halt the unregistered offering of 
LADP shares.  LADP has no business operations.   
 
              3.      On February 11,  2011, a Judgment was entered against Bercoon, 
permanently enjoining him from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities 
Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder  
in the civil action entitled Securities and Exchange Commission v. LADP Acquisition, Inc. et al., 
Civil Action Number CV10-6835, in the United States District Court for the Central District of 
California.  Bercoon was also ordered to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment 
interest, and a civil money penalty to be determined by the Court upon motion by the Commission. 
 
              4.      The Commission’s complaint alleged, among other things, that Bercoon 
participated in a fraudulent securities offering pursuant to which at least $3.2 million was raised 
from at least 110 investors nationwide, from mid-2009 through the present.  Investors were cold-
called and offered and sold shares in L.A. Digital Post, Inc. (“L.A. Digital”), a television and film 
production company with offices in Los Angeles and New York, purportedly to grow the business  
of L.A. Digital.  Bercoon directly and indirectly falsely told investors that L.A. Digital would 
conduct an initial public offering of its stock within two to six months, and that its shares would 

                                               2

soon trade on the New York Stock Exchange or the American Stock Exchange.  In fact, Bercoon 
and others employed a “bait-and-switch” scheme  whereby purchasers of the shares received stock 
certificates stating that they own shares in LADP, rather than in L.A. Digital.  No public offering 
of L.A. Digital stock has occurred.  Moreover, Bercoon has not distributed any monies raised in 
the LADP offering to L.A. Digital.  Instead, Bercoon, who is one of the individuals who controls 
LADP’s bank accounts, participated in the misappropriation for his and his co-defendant’s own 
use and the use of other companies they control of at least $874,289 of the $3.2 million in investor  
funds raised. 
 
                                                       IV. 
                                                          
         In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
impose the sanction agreed to in Respondent Bercoon’s Offer.  
 
         Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that Bercoon is suspended 
from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an attorney or accountant. 
 
 By the Commission.              
 
 
 
       Elizabeth                                                               M. Murphy
       Secretary
