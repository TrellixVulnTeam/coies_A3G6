              Defendant. 

       Plaintiff, Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission"),  alleges:
 

                                       SUMMARY
 

       1.     During the period from 1996 through 2004, Dimon, Incorporated ("Dimon") 

made multiple improper payments to foreign officials in Kyrgyzstan and Thailand in violation of 

the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 ("FCPA").  During the period from 2001 through 

2004, Standard Commercial Corporation("Standard")  made multiple improper payments to 

foreign officials in Thailand in violation ofthe FCPA. In May 2005, Dimon and Standard 

merged to form Alliance One International, Inc. ("Alliance One"). 

       2.     From 1996 through 2004, Dimon International Kyrgyzstan  ("DIK"), a wholly-

owned subsidiary ofDimon, paid more than  $3 million in bribes to Kyrgyzstan government 

officials in order to purchase Kyrgyz tobacco for resale to Dimon's  customers.  These payments 

were made to various government officials, including officials ofthe JSC GAK Kyrgyztamekisi 

("Tamekisi") and local public officials ("Akims").  DIK also made improper payments to 

Kyrgyzstan tax officials.  Dimon's  Country Manager authorized, directed, and made these

           6.     Despite their extensive international  operations, Dimon and Standard lacked 

   sufficient internal controls designed to prevent  or detect violations ofthe FCPA. During the 

   2000-2004 period, Dimon and Standard each had a policy manual prohibiting bribery, but the 

   training and guidance provided to their employees regarding compliance with the FCPA were 

   not adequate or effective.  Dimon and Standard each also failed to establish a program to monitor 

   compliance with the FCPA    by its employees,  agents, and subsidiaries. 

           7.     Dimon improperly recorded bribes and other improper payments  in its books and 

   records as Selling, General, and Administrative  expenses.  Standard failed to make  and keep 

   records that accurately reflected its transactions  in Thailand and China, including its transactions 

   with the TTM. 

           8.     By  its conduct, defendant Alliance One violated the anti-bribery provision ofthe 

   FCPA, Section 30A    ofthe Securities Exchange  Act  of 1934 ("Exchange  Act") [15 U.S.C. § 

   78dd-l], by making or agreeing to make improper payments to foreign government officials in 

   order toobtain or retain business.  Defendant  Alliance One also violated Sections 13(b)(2)(A) 

--and  13(b)(2)(B)  ofthe Exchange"Actfl5U-S.C.§§       78m(b)(2)(A) and 78m(b)(2)(B)]  byfailing 

   to maintain an adequate internal control system to detect and prevent improper payments and    by 

   improperly recording these payments   in its books and records.  Unless restrained  and enjoined by 

   the Court, defendant Alliance One will continue to engage in acts and practices that constitute, or 

   will constitute, violations ofthese provisions.

                                             FACTS 

A.     Payments   To  Kyrgyzstan   Government    Officials 

        18.    In August 1994, Dimon began business operations in Osh, Kyrgyzstan, through 

DIK. 

        19.    On  September  1, 1996, the Kyrgyzstan  government imposed a requirement that 

all exporters of fennented  tobacco have an export license.  The Tamekisi acted as the issuing 

authority and controlled the issuance of export licenses, thus effectively controlling all tobacco 

purchases in Kyrgyzstan.  A high-ranking Tamekisi  official had the authority to sign export 

licenses.  During this time, a Tamekisi official infonned  DIK that the export licensing 

requirement would result in greater competition for DIK from other companies and that 

"Tamekisi will sh:are in any profit [Dimon] makes." 

       20.   . Under Presiaentia] Order; the Tainekisi  wasrespollsibleforoverseeing  the· 

fennentation of tobacco.  The Tamekisi operated state-controlled tobacco fennentation  plants 

throughout Kyrgyzstan and prohibited private fermentation plants from operating in Kyrgyzstan. 

       21.     On October 22, 1996, Dimon International Inc. (USA), Dimon's  wholly-owned 

subsidiary, signed an agreement with the Tamekisi  stating, among other things, "The cost of 

services for tobacco fermentation  at tobacco plants shall be set up in the amount of$0.18 U.S. 

per kg.  Apart from that, DIMON shall pay $0.05 U.S. per kg. on the settlement account  ofthe 

Kyrgyz party  fOf financial assistance."  The payments for "financial assistance" were made by 

Dimon's  Country Manager in cash to a high-ranking Tamekisi official and had no legitimate 

business purpose. 

                                                5 
---------------------Page 6---------------------

        22.    Dimon's   COWltry Manager received periodic calls from a high-ranking Tamekisi 

 official regarding the "financial assistance" payments  and periodically delivered bags filled with 

 $100 bills to the high-ranking Tamekisi official at the Tamekisi's  office in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. 

 From 1996 to 2004, Dimon's  Country Manager paid more than $2.6 million to the high-ranking 

 Tamekisi official. 

        23.    Dimon's  Country Manager also paid bribes to local government officials in 

 Kyrgyzstan known   ~s Akims, who controlled the tobacco regions.  DIK needed the support and 

 consent ofeach Akim in order to purchase tobacco from local growers or agricultural collectives. 

 Akims had the power and influence to prevent the purchase  of tobacco in their respective 

 regions, even if a company had an export license.  Akims could also send the police to block the 

 entrance to buying stations or install a lock box to prevent the transfer oftobacco. 

        24.    DIK paid Akims approximately $0.01 per kilogram     of tobacco it purchased from 

 growers in each province.  From 1996 to 2004, Dimon's  Country Manager authorized and paid 

 more than $260,000 to the Akims.

 government officials in Kyrgyzstan through a DIK bank account held under his name called the 

 Special Account.  The Special Account was funded   by wire transfers from another Dimon 

. subsidiary.  These wire transfers were authorized  by Dimon's  RegionafFinancial Director. 

. Dimon's  International Controller formalized the accounting methodology used to record the 

 improper payments  made from the Special Account.  Specifically, Dimon recorded these 

 payments as tobacco inventory in DIK's  balance sheet.  As DIK's tobacco was sold, the cost of 

 that tobacco and the capitalized expenditures from the Special Account were removed from 

 inventory and charged to DIK's  cost of goods sold through an amortization process.  DIK's  cost 

                                                6

of goods sold was incorporated in Dimon's   consolidated  financial statements  as cost of goods 

sold. 

B.     Payments to Government  Officials     Of Thailand 

       26.     From 2000 to 2003, Dimon, and from 2001 to 2004, Standard colluded with 

another competitor  to pay bribes ofmore than $1.2 million to government officials of the TTM 

in exchange for obtaining more than $18.3 million in sales contracts.  These sales were made 

through Dimon and Standard's  subsidiaries  in Brazil, Dimon do Brasil Tabacos Ltda. and 

Standard Brazil Limited, respectively.  Dimon falsely recorded these payments  as commissions 

in its books and records, and Standard failed to accurately record these payments  in its books  and 

records. 

       27.     Dimon's  sales oftobacco from Brazil and Malawi to the TTM were directed  and 

coordinated by Dimon's  Senior Vice President  of Sales in the United States and Dimon's 

personnel in Brazil.  Standard's  sales oftobacco from Brazil to the TTM were directed  and 

coordinated by Standard's  personnel in Brazil  and Europe. 

       28.    .A portion of Diinonarid Standard; s selling price to the TTMwas   designated on ~ .... 

per kilogram  basis as "special expenses"  or "special commissions,"  which were kickbacks  paid 

through their agents to certain members of the TTM in exchange for the sales contracts ..During 

the period 2000 through 2003,  Dimon made corrupt payments    of approximately  $542,590 to 

TTMgovernment  officials.  Similarly, from 2001 through 2004, Standard made corrupt 

payments  of $696,160 to TTM government officials. 

C.     Books and Records and Internal  Control Violations 

                       Improper  Payments  to Tax Officials in Kyrgyzstan 

       29.     DIK was frequently subjected to audits by  Kyrgyz tax officials.  The tax 

inspections  generally lasted about seven weeks and DIK personnel devoted most   of their work 

                                                7
 
---------------------Page 8---------------------

hours  to responding  to queries from the tax officials.  Upon completion of one audit, the Kyrgyz 

tax officials would begin performing  yet another inspection.  During the relevant timeperiod,  the 

tax authorities  reduced the tax penalties levied  against DIK in exchange for c.~sh payments. 

From  1996 through  2004, Dimon through    DIK  paid approximately  $82,850  to Kyrgyz  tax 

officials  to reduce tax penalties. 

          Improper  Gifts And Payments  To Government  Officials In China   And  Thailand 

        30.     Between  2000 and 2003, Dimon  arranged purported  business  trips that were 

actually  sightseeing  trips arranged by Dimon  and others  for TIM officials. 

        31.     By at least May 2005, Standard provided  gifts, travel, and entertainment  expenses 

to government  officials  in the Asian Region. For example,  in 2002 and 2003, contemporaneous 

documents show  that Standard  employees  provided  watches,  cameras, laptop computers,  and 

other gifts to Chinese  and Thailand  tobacco  officials.  Standard  also paid for dinner  and 

sightseeing  expenses  during non-business  related travel to Alaska, Los Angeles,  and Las Vegas 

for Chinese and  Thailand  government delegations  ...

Standard's  agent for tobacco  sales in Thailand.  The $50,000 payment  was falsely recorded  in 

Standard's  books as a payment  for consulting  work. 

                   Improper  Payments  to Tax Officials in Greece  and Indonesia 

        33.     During  a routine  internal  audit oftwo Dimon  subsidiaries  in Greece in May and 

June 2003,  Dimon's   internal  auditors inquired  about  certain transactions  in amiscellaneous 

expense  account.  Disbursements  from  this account  were labeled "special marketing  expenses," 

and included  a cash payment  of $96,000  to a Greek tax official in April 2003 by the country 

manager   ofDimon  Greece.  The Greek tax official  was conducting  an audit  ofDimon  Greece at 

the time of the payment. 

                                                 8
 
---------------------Page 9---------------------

        34.    ·The cash payment was made in exchange for the     G~eek  tax official's  agreement 

 not to pursue  over alleged irregularities  discovered  during the audit.  As a result of the payment, 

 Dimon  Greece's  tax payment was reduced from approximately  2.5 million Ellros to 

 approximately  600,000  Euros.  The payment  to the Greek tax official was recorded  in a 

 miscellaneous  account as part of Dimon Greece's Selling,  General, and Administrative 

 Expenses,  which was incorporated  in Dimon's   consolidated  financial  statements. 

         35.    In July 2004, Indonesian  tax authorities  initiated an audit ofthe 2003 tax return of 

 P.T. Mayangsari,  Dimon's  Indonesian  subsidiary.  Dimon owned    75%  ofMayangsari.  According 

 to the tax return, Mayangsari  was entitled to receive  a refund of$630,375,745  Indonesian  Rupiah 

 (about $68,000)  in connection  with the overpayment  ofincome and value added taxes.  During 

 the audit, one ofthe Indonesian  supervising  tax officials suggested to Mayangsari' s Controller 

 that Mayangsari  resolve the audit by making  a cash payment  of 410,000,000  Rupiah (about 

 $44,000)  to the tax  official. Mayangsari~s Controller  agreed.  In August 2004, Mayangsari's 

. Contr()lleimade the cash payment to the tax official  in exchange for terminating  the audit and 

·obiitintng·atax  refund of018,591 ,983 Rupiah (abou($67,OOO). . 

        36.     In August 2004, Mayangsari's  Controller recorded the cash payment  in 

 Mayangsari's  books  and records as a purchase of tobacco  and attributed to Mayangsari's  Selling, 

 General,  and Administrative  Expenses,  which was incorporated  in Dimon's  consolidated 

 financial  statements.
