                                  SUMMARY      OF  THE ACTION 
23 
            1.     This case involves a financial reporting fraud committed by defendant  Stuart 

24   W. Fuhlendorf  ("Fuhlendorf'),  the former Chief Financial Officer ofIsilon Systems, Inc. 
25   ("Isilon" or the "Company"),  a Seattle-based data storage device company. In December 

26   2006, Isilon had the most successful Initial Public Offering for a technology stock since the 

27   autumn of 2000.  On the first day oftrading, Isilon' s stock price rose from $13.00 to $23.10

    Complaint                                                           Securities and Exchange Commission 
     SEC v. Fuhlendorf                                                                          th

                                                                               Telephone: (415) 705-2500

 1  per share, a 77 percent increase from the initial offering price.  The  successful  stock offering
 

 2  placed significant pressure  on Isilon's  management,  however, to maintain the stock price
 

 3  gams.
 

 4          2.      As Isilon's  actual sales results came in for the three quarters following the 

 5  Initial Public Offering, Fuhlendorfknew  that the Company would not meet the analysts'
 

 6  revenue  forecasts and that Isilon's  share price was at risk ofa significant decline.  Fuhlendorf
 

 7  therefore  engaged  in a scheme to inflate Isilon's  reported revenues  in violation ofthe
 

 8  requirements   of the Company's  own accounting policies as well as Generally Accepted
 

 9  Accounting  Principles  ("GAAP").
 

10          3.      Fuhlendorf  fraudulently  caused Isilon to improperly recognize revenue     on five 

11  transactions  in its first three quarters as a public company and concealed the fraud from 

12  Isilon's  Audit Committee,  outside auditor, and Controller.  Fuhlendorfknew  that Isilon, on 

13  multiple  occasions, booked "sales"  to resellers who did not have firm commitments  from end­

14  users  or the ability to pay without the resale. He also participated  in a roundtrip  transaction 

15  where Isilon purchased  software from  a customer who used the software  revenue from Isilon 

16  to "purchase"  Isilon product.  Fuhlendorf  also played a part in a transaction  where the terms 

17  were not fixed until after the quarter ended. 

18          4.      By  engaging  in this scheme to report revenue in violation  of GAAP and the 

19   Company's  accounting  policies,  Fuhlendorfknowingly  and/or recklessly  caused Isilon to 

20  report revenues  that were materially inflated  by a total of$4.8 million  over the first three 

21   quarters  folloWing the Initial Public Offering. 

22           5.     The Commission  seeks an order enjoining Fuhlendorf  from future violations       of 

23  the securities laws, requiring him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment  interest, 

24  pay a civil monetary  penalty, and repay certain bonuses and stock profits, and barring him 

25  from serving as an officer  or director of a public company.

 2          6.      The Commission  brings this action pursuant  to Section 20(b)   of the Securities 

 3  Act  of 1933 ("Securities  Act")  [15 U.S.C.  § 77t(b)] and Section 21(d) ofthe Securities 

 4  Exchange   Act  of 1934 ("Exchange  Act")  [15 U.S.C.  §§  78u(d)].  This Court has jurisdiction 

 5  over this action pursuant  to Section 22(a) of the Securities  Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v(a)] and 

 6  Sections  21(e) and 27  ofthe Exchange Act [15 U.S.C.    §§  78u(e) and 78aa]. 

 7          7.      Fuhlendorf,  directly or indirectly,  has made use ofthe means and 

 8  instrumentalities of interstate  commerce, of the mails,  or'ofthe facilities ofa national 

 9  securities  exchange, in connection  with the acts, practices,  courses ofbusiness,  and 

10  transactions alleged  herein. 

11          8.      This District is an appropriate  venue for this action under  Section 22 ofthe 

12  Securities  Act [15 U.S.C.  § 77v] and Section 27  of the Exchange  Act [15 U.S.C.   § 78aa]. 

13  Certain  of the acts, practices,  courses ofbusiness,  and transactions constituting the violations 

14  alleged herein  occurred  within the Western District of Washington,  where the defendant 

15  resides.  Assignment  to the Seattle Division  is appropriate  because much  ofthe relevant 

16  conduct  took place  in King County. 

17                                        THE    DEFENDANT 

18          9.      Stuart W. Fuhlendorf,  age 47, resides in Seattle, Washington.   At the time of 

19  the events alleged herein,  Fuhlendorfwas  the CFO    of Isilon. Fuhlendorfs   employment  with 

20  Isilon terminated  in October  2007.  Prior to joining  Isilon in 2004, Fuhlendorf  served as CFO 

21  for two companies    in the technology  and manufacturing  sectors.  During the Commission's 

22  investigation,  Fuhlendorf  refused to answer questions,  asserting his right against self-

23  incrimination  under the Fifth Amendment  to the United  States Constitution.

 3                                   FACTUAL  ALLEGATIONS 

 4          11.     Isilon went public in December 2006 in the most successful IPO for a 

 5  technology stock since autumn 2000.  On the first day   of trading, Isilon's  stock price rose 

 6  from $13.00 to $23.10, a 77 percent increase from the initial offering price~ The success, 

 7  however, placed significant pressure on Isilon's management at the time.  Analysts covering 

 8  Isilon projected revenue for the company to grow from $21.5 million in the fourth quarter 

 9  2006 to $29.9 million for the second quarter  of 2007 and revenue to remain in "hyper-growth" 

10  through 2009. 

11          12.     At the time ofthe  events alleged herein, Isilon's policy, as described in 

12  multiple SEC filings, was to recognize revenue on sales to end-users and resellers when it (1) 

13  had entered into a legally binding arrangement with a customer, (2) delivery had occurred, (3) 

14  the fee was deemed fixed or determinable and free    of contingencies and significant 

15  uncertainties, and (4) collection was probable.  With sales to resellers, Isilon had an internal 

16  written policy that the company did not recognize revenue on sales to resellers without 

17  persuasive evidence   ofa firm arrangement with an end-user customer.  Isilon typically 

18  accepted purchase orders from resellers and end-users as the legally binding arrangement 

19  outlining the terms of the sale. 

20          13.     In response to pressure from the market to perform, Fuhlendorf fraudulently 

21  caused Isilon to improperly recognize revenue on five transactions in its first three quarters as 

22  a public company, totaling $4.8 million.  Fuhlendorfknew  or was reckless in not knowing 

23  that Isilon, on multiple occasions, sold to resellers who did not have firm commitments from 

24  end-users  or the ability to pay without the resale.  He also participated in a roundtrip 

25  transaction where Isilon purchased software from a customer who used the software revenue 

26  from Isilon to purchase Isilon product.  Fuhlendorf also played a part in a sale where the terms 

27  were not fixed until after the quarter ended.  This fraud was concealed  by Fuhlendorf from

 2          A.	     Fourth  Quarter  2006:  Fuhlendorf  Improperly  Recognized Revenue on a 
                    $1.1 Million Transaction  with  an  IsUon Reseller. 
 3 
            14.     For the fourth quarter of2006, Isilon expected one  ofits largest resellers 
 4 
    ("Reseller  1"), based in West Teterboro, New Jersey, to place a $1 million order, but as the 
 5
    quarter progressed, Reseller 1 advised Isilon that, because its end-user did not yet need the 
 6 
    product, the order would not  be forthcoming in 2006. 
 7 
            15.     After the IPO, in mid-December 2006, Fuhlendorf and Isilon's  former CEO 
 8 
    called the CEO ofReseller  1 and asked   ifReseller 1 would accept shipment   of over $1 million 
 9 
    in product before the end  ofthe year as a "favor" to Isilon.  Fuhlendorf and Isilon's former 
10
    CEO made this request for a favor, knowing that Reseller 1 did not have a purchase 
11 

13 
    order and payment from an end-user. 
14 
            16.     The CEO   of ReseUer 1 agreed to order and warehouse $1.1 million in Isilon 
15
    product based on the assurance it would not have to pay for the product until it received an 
16 
    order and payment from an end-user.  The assurance provided to Reseller 1     by Fuhlendorf  or 
17 
    Isilon's  former CEO did not appear in the purchase order issued  by Reseller 1 on December 
18 
    20,2006. 
19 
            17.     The purchase order from the end-user never materialized, and Reseller 1 
20
    refused to pay for the product and instead sought to return the product. In 2008, Isilon agreed 
21 
    to accept the return ofthe product, less $382,000 in product Reseller 1 was able to sell to 
22 
    other end-users in the third and fourth quarters of2007. 
23 
            18.     Despite the oral side agreement, Isilon improperly recognized $900,000 in 
24 
    revenue on the transaction in the fourth quarter of 2006.  On February 7,2007,  Isilon filed a 
25
    current report on Form 8-K announcing its results for the fourth quarter and year-ended 
26 
    December 31, 2006.  Isilon reported revenue for the fourth quarter  of $20.7 million, $900,000

 1  of which came from the Reseller  1 transaction.  This was improper under GAAP because 

 2  Isilon had no firm commitment  from Reseller  1 to    pay for the product without a resale and 

 3  thus the sale was not free  of contingencies. 

 4           19.     Isilon reported the same false and misleading  financial information   in its Form 

 5  lO-K for 2006, filed with the Commission  on March 15, 2007.  In the filing, Fuhlendorf 

 6  falsely certified  that he had reviewed  the Form 10-K and that it did not contain any untrue 

 7  statements  of material  fact or omit to state a material fact necessary  to make the statements 

 8  made,   in light ofthe circumstances  under which such statements were made, not misleading. 

 9  Isilon's  Form  lO-K for 2006 - as well as all subsequently  filed quarterly reports - was 

10  incorporated   by reference  into a Form S-8 registration  statement filed by Isilon on January  18, 

11   2007 offering  securities  to its employees. 

12           20.     Fuhlendorf also made false and misleading representations to Isilon' s outside 

13   auditor about the Reseller  1 transaction.  In a representation  letter dated March 14,2007, 

14  Fuhlendorf  falsely stated that there were no material transactions,  agreements,   or accounts 

15  that had  not been properly  recorded  in the accounting records underlying  Isilon's  consolidated 

16  financial  statements  and that Fuhlendorfwas  not aware   of any oral or written side agreements 

17  with respect to any  of the sales recorded. 

18           21.     Fuhlendorfknew    or was reckless in not knowing that Isilon's  statements   in its 

19  Forms  8-K,  lO-K, and S-8, the certification,  and the representation  letter were false and 

20   misleading  because  he directly participated  in the Reseller  1 transaction  that caused Isilon to 

21   overstate  its revenue  for the quarter.

23 
             22.     The pressure  that Isilon felt after the very successful  IPO only increased  during 
24 
     its first full quarter as a public company.  There was significant pressure  on Isilon to meet 
25
     analysts'  expectations or to at least meet the projections  Isilon had provided  to the market. By 
26 
     the end of the first quarter  the pressure  to bring inrevenue hit a peak with Fuhlendorf and

 1  Isilon's  Vice President of Sales arranging an 8:00 a.m. conference call with the entire sales 

 2  organization  on Saturday, March 31, where Fuhlendorftold  the sales force to do whatever 

 3  needed to  be  done to get sales booked before the quarter-end and in particular, to close deals 

 4  that had previously  been categorized as probable first-quarter sales. 

 5          23.     In the final days of the first quarter, Fuhlendorf directly participated in three 

 6  transactions  that accounted for $3.1 million in reported revenue for the quarter.  Two   ofthe 

 7  transactions  involved sales to resellers where Fuhlendorfknew  or was reckless in not knowing 

 8  that collection was not reasonably assured and the third involved    a fraudulent round-trip 

. 9  transaction  with an end-user where collection was not assured without Isilon's  cash payment 

10  to the end-user.  As Fuhlendorfknew,  recognizing revenue on these transactions was 

11   improper under GAAP. 

12                  i.  The  Undisclosed   Oral  Side Agreement    in Sale to Reseller  2 

13           24.    In the first quarter of2007, a small Burbank, California reseller that serves 

14  companies  in the film industry ("Reseller 2") told Isilon that it might place an order for 

15   approximately  $500,000 worth    ofproduct before the end  of the quarter.  However, as the 

16  quarter-end  approached,  Reseller 2 declined to place an order because it had not received  a 

17  purchase  order from its anticipated end-User. 

18           25.    On the second-to-Iast day   of the quarter, Saturday March 31, the Isilon sales 

19  representative  on the Reseller 2 account scheduled a three-way conference call among 

20  himself, the president  of Reseller 2, and Fuhlendorf.  During the call, the president of Reseller 

21   2 informed Fuhlend6rf that Reseller 2 did not have a purchase order from the end-user and 

22  that Reseller  2 would not  be able to pay for the product until it resold.  Fuhlendorf assured 

23  Reseller 2 that lack of a purchase order from the end-user would not    be a problem and that 

24  Isilon would help Reseller 2 resell the product to another end-user   ifnecessary.  Reseller 2 

25  asked FuWendorf to memorialize  his assurances in writing and FuWendorf declined. 

26          26.     Reseller 2 decided to go forward with the deal based on Fuhlendorrs  oral 

27  assurances,  assurances that did not appear - at Fuhlendorrs  insistence - in the purchase order

 1  issued by  Reseller 2.  Reseller 2 placed an order the night of Saturday, March 31, 2007, for 

 2  $517,000 ofIsilon  product,  of which Isilon improperly recognized $453,000 in revenue for 

 3  the first quarter.  Isilon's recognition ofrevenue on the sale was in violation ofGAAP 

 4  because, as Fuhlendorfknew,  there was no firm commitment from Reseller 2 and 

 5  collectability was not reasonably assured,  Additionally, Fuhlendorfknew  that, in violation  of 

 6  GAAP, Isilon had an ongoing involvement in the transaction since Isilon sales people were 

 7  obliged to help the buyer find.an end-user. 

 8          27.     Ultimately, Reseller 2's end-user did not issue a purchase order.  The product 

 9  was resold  by Isilon's  sales force, working on behalf ofReseller 2, to other end-users in the 

10  fourth quarter of 2007 and the first quarter of2008.  Reseller 2 did not pay Isilon for the 

11  product until it was sold through to the end-users. 

12                  ii. The  Undisclosed  Oral  Side Agreement    in Sale to Reseller  3 

13          28.     Also during the first quarter of2007,  another small reseller out ofNorth 

14  Hollywood, California serving the entertainment industry ("Reseller 3") informed Isilon that 

15  it anticipated a $600,000 order from an end-user soon.  As quarter-end approached, 

16  Fuhlendorf asked the president   ofReseller 3 to take the Isilon product without a final 

17  purchase order from the end-user.  Reseller 3 advised Fuhlendorfthat  Reseller 3 could not pay 

18  without an end-user and Reseller 3 could not have non-payment hurt its relationship with 

19  Isilon.  Fuhlendorf responded that non-payment would not result in a credit hold and that 

20  Isilon would find another home for the product   ifnecessary.  None ofFuhlendorf's oral 

21  promises appeared in the purchase order issued   by Reseller 3. 

22          29.     With the assurances from Fuhlendorf, Reseller 3 ordered $638,000 in Isilon 

23  product on March 31, 2007,    ofwhich Isilon recognized $612,000 in revenue in the first 

24  quarter.  Isilon's  recognition ofrevenue was in violation ofGAAP  because, as Fuhlendorf 

25'  knew, there was no firm commitment and collectability on the sale was not reasonably 

26  assured.  Moreover, Fuhlendorfknew  that, in violation ofGAAP,  Isilon had an ongoing 

27  involvement in the transaction since Isilon sales people were continuing to try to sell the

 2          30.     The  end-user did not materialize  for Reseller  3, which, per the oral side 

 3  agreement,· did not pay Isilon for the product until it was sold to another end-user.  About 

 4  $200,000   in product was ultimately  resold by Reseller  3; the remaining  product  was returned 

 5  to Isilon in June 2008. 

 6                  iii. The  Bogus  Roundtrip   Transaction 

 7          31.     In mid-February  2007, a small start-up software  company ("Software 

 8  Company")  based    in Redwood  City, California,  issued a purchase  order to Isilon for $2.8 

 9  million  in product.  The purchase  order stated it was contingent  on the Software  Company 

10  receiving  authorization  from the Italian government  for use ofits product. 

            32.     By  late March, Fuhlendorflearned  that it was unlikely  that the Italian 

12  government  would authorize  use   of the product before the end  ofthe quarter,  and thus the 

13   contingency  would not  be lifted - preventing  revenue recognition  under GAAP.    In response, 

14  Fuhlendorf called the president   ofthe Software Company and negotiated a deal whereby the 

15  SoftWare Company  would complete its purchase       ofIsilon hardware  before the end  ofthe fIrst 

16   quarter  and in return Isilon would purchase the Software Company's  software    in the second 

17  quarter  of2007.   Fuhlendorf  committed  Isilon to buy the Software Company's  software 

18  knowing  that the product had  not been tested with Isilon's  hardware  and knowing  that neither 

19  .sales nor marketing  plans had been established.  Because the president  of the Software 

20  Company  told Fuhlendorf during the call that   he did not want this deal t6 impact the Software 

21   Company's   cash flow, Fuhlendorf structured the transaction so that Isilon' s cash payments to 

22   the Software  Company  would  flow back to Isilon. 

23           33.    The deal struck  by Fuhlendorf  and the Software Company's  president  was 

24   memorialized  in two separate documents  dated March 30.  The separate documents  concealed 

25  the true nature of the transaction  creating a misleading  appearance of two separate  and 

26  independent  deals rather than the interrelated  transaction  negotiated by Fuhlendorf. In one 

27  document,  the Software  Company  agreed to immediately  lift the contingency  on $2.2 million

 2  other $1.2 million due  by July 1. In the second agreement, signed  by  Fuhlendorf, Isilon 

 3  agreed to purchase $1.3 million  of the Software Company's  product on April 26 and pay for    it 

 4  by May 26 (four days before the Software Company would pay        $1 million to Isilon).

16  before the Software Company  was to pay $1.2 million to Isilon for the Isilon product). 

17  Although the written agreement signed    by Fuhlendorf stated that Isilon had the "option"  to 

18  order $1.0 million in additional Software Company product on or before June 30, during the 

19  phone call negotiating the transaction, Fuhlendorf characterized the additional order to the 

20  president of the Software Company not as an option, but as an actual commitment to 

21  purchase.  During Isilon's  Audit Committee review    ofthe transaction, Fuhlendorffalse1y 

22  described to the Committee a rationale and business purpose for Isilon to purchase the 

23  Software Company's  product, when, in fact, there was no legitimate business purpose or 

24  economic substance to the deal.

            35.     Of the $2.2 million sale ofproduct to the Software Company, Isilon recognized 
11 
12  revenue on $2.0 million  in the first quarter of2007.  Isilon's recognition ofthe revenue on the 

13  transaction with the Software Company was in violation    of GAAP because,    as Fuhlendorf 

14  knew, it was a round-trip transaction in which the essence  ofthe transaction was a circular 

15  flow  ofcash and there was no economic substance to the deal.  Fuhlendorf also knew that 

16  collectability was not assured. 

            36.     After the first quarter ended, per the agreements, Isilon paid $1.2 million to the 
17 
18  Software Company and the Software Company paid        $1 million to Isilon.  Isilon, however, did 

19  not purchase additional Software Company product as it found no business use for the 

20  Software Company's  software and no way to sell it bundled with Isilon's hardware.  In 

21  response to Isilon's  failure to place the second order, the Software Company refused to make 

22  the second scheduled payment    of $1.2 million and instead, made a partial payment  of 

23  approximately $200,000 to offset the $1.2 million Isilon had paid to the Software Company 

24  on May 22. 

            37.     On April 25, 2007, Isilon filed a Form 8-K announcing its results for the first 
25
26  quarter ended April  1, 2007.  Isilon reported revenue of$21.6  million, ofwhich  $3.1 million

 1  Software-Company.  Fuhlendorfknew  the recognition       of the $3.1 million was improper 

 2  because  he  knew  of oral side agreements  with Reseller  1 and Reseller 2 and knew 

 3  collectability was not reasonably assured   on any of the three transactions.  Fuhlendorf further 

 4  knew that recognition   of the revenue  on the roundtrip transaction  with the Software Company 

 5  was improper  because  there was no economic substance to the transaction. 

 6          38.     Isilon also reported this inflated revenue in its Form 10-Q, filed with the 

 7  Commission  on May 10, 2007.  Fuhlendorf  signed the Form 10-Q, as well as a certification 

 8  falsely stating that the Form 10-Q did not contain any untrue statements    ofmaterial  fact or 

 9   omi~ to state a material  fact necessary  to make the statements made, in light ofthe 

10  circumstances  under which such statements  were made, not misleading. 

11          39.     Fuhlendorf  also signed a representation  letter, dated May 9,2007,  to Isilon's 

12  outside  auditor that falsely stated that the consolidated  interim financial statements had been 

13  prepared  and presented  in conformity  with GAAP; that there were no material  transactions, 

14  agreements,   or accounts that had not been properly recorded in the accounting records 

15  underlying the consolidated financial statements; and that Fuhlendorf was not aware      of any 

16  oral or written  side agreements  with respect to any of the sales recorded.

20   for the quarter. 

21­         c.	     Second Quarter 2007:  Fuhlendorf Improperly Approved Recognition              of 
                    $800,000   in Revenue on a Transaction  with an IsUon End-User. 
22 
            41.     In June 2007, a Paris, France based video file-sharing  company  (the "Video 
23 
     Company")  started discussions  with Isilon about purchasing  product.  By  late June, the Video 
24 
     Company  and Isilon had come close to finalizing  a deal for the sale of $1 million in Isilon 
25
    product.  Before the deal closed, however,  the Video Company's  CFO advised an Isilon sales 
26 
    representative  that the Video Company  could not enter into the transaction  until it received

                                                                                 44 Montgomery  Street, 26 Floor 
                                                                                        San Francisco, CA 94104 
                                                                                     . Telephone:  (415) 705-2500

 1  approval  from its board.  The CFO also informed  the sales representative  that the board would 

 2  not meet  to approve the transaction  until early July, after the close ofIsilon's second quarter. 

 3          42.     Fuhlendorflearned  about the contingency  in June from the sales manager. 

 4  Despite  the fact that the Video  Company's  board had not yet approved the deal, Isilon shipped 

 5  over  $1 million  ofproduct to the Video Company      on July 1,2007 (the last day  ofIsilon's 

 6  second  quarter)  and recognized  the revenue  in Isilon's  second quarter. 

 7          43.     As it turned out, the Video  Company's  board did not approve the deal. 

 8  Instead, on  or around July  3, 2007, before  Isilon filed its financial statements  for the second 

 9  quarter  of2007,  the Video Company proposed  different terms, nearly doubling  the amount       of 

10  product  Isilon would provide  at no additional  charge.  Isilon accepted the new terms and   on 

11  July 5, the Video Company's  CFO confirmed  the new deal with the additional product        by  e­

12  mail to Fuhlendorf  and others. 

13          44.      On July 26,2007,   Isilon filed a Form 8-K announcing  its results for the second 

14  quarter-ended  July  1,2007.   Isilon reported  revenue  of$25.1  million.  This revenue included 

15  $800,000  from the Video Company transaction.  Isilon's  recognition     of revenue  for this sale 

16  was  in violation of GAAP because,  as Fuhlendorf  was aware, the  terms were not fixed and 

17  determinable  at quarter-end. 

18           45.     On August   9,2007,  Isilon filed its Form  lO-Q for the second quarter reporting 

19  the same false and misleading  financial  information.  Fuhlendorfsigned  the Form  10-Q, as 

20   well as a certification  falsely stating that the Form  10-Q did not contain any untrue statements 

21  of material  fact or omit to state a material  fact necessary  to make the statements  made, in light 

22  of the circumstances  under which such statements  were made, not misleading. 

23          46.      Fuhlendorf  also signed a representation  letter to Isilon's  outside auditor,  dated 

24   August  8, 2007, that falsely stated that the consolidated  interim financial statements had been 

25  prepared  and presented   in conformity  with GAAP; that there were no material transactions, 

26  agreements   or accounts  that had not been properly  recorded  in the accounting  records 

27  underlying  the consolidated  financial  statements;  and that Fuhlendorf  was not aware  of any 
28   Complaint                                           13                    Securities and Exchange  Commission 
     SEC v. Fublendorf                                                                                    th 
                                                                                  44 Montgomery  Street, 26 Floor

 1  oral Or written side agreements with respect to any  ofthe sales recorded. 

 2          47.     Fuhlendorfknew  or was reckless in not knowing that the Forms 8-K and 10-Q, 

 3  the certification, and the representation letter were false because he directly participated in the 

 4  transaction that caused Isilon to overstate its revenue for the quarter. 

 5          48.     In the third quarter of2007, Fuhlendorfinformed  Isilon's  Controller that Isilon 

 6  needed to ship product free-of-charge to the Video Company.  Instead     oftelling the Controller 

 7  that Isilon was shipping the product pursuant to the July 5 email agreement, Fuhlendorf 

 8  concealed the terms  of the agreement and falsely told the Controller that the product would be 

 9  shipped as a "loan" and would be returned at some point in the future.  Fuhlendorf told the 

10  Controller that the loan was part of a customer care issue and the loaned equipment would be 

11  used  by the Video Company while making repairs to the purchased product. 

12          D.      Isilon Restated Its Past Financial Statements. 

13          49.     On October 23, 2007, Fuhlendorf's  employment with Isilon terminated.  On 

14  November 8,2007,  Isilon publicly announced that its Audit Committee was conducting an 

15  independent internal investigation. 

16          50.     On February 29, 2008, Isilon disclosed that, as a result ofthe investigation, it 

17  would restate its financial statements in its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 

18  2006 and in its Forms lO-Q the first and second quarters   of fiscal 2007.  In the restatement, 

19  the company corrected $7.0 million    ofthe $67.4 million  ofrevenue reported from the fourth 

20  quarter of2006   through the second quarter of2007.    Ofthe  $7.0 million restated, $4.8 million 

21  derived from the improper revenue recognition on the sales described above.
