ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING 
File No. 3-17742 
 
Banking Software Company Agrees to Settle Accounting Charges 
 
December 21, 2016 – The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that banking 
software company Jack Henry & Associates, Inc. (“JKHY”) has agreed to settle charges that it 
materially misstated its financials for fiscal years ending June 30, 2013 and June 30, 2014.  
 
According to the SEC’s order, JKHY materially misstated its revenue, net income, and other 
financial metrics in certain of its annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC and in certain of 
its earnings releases.  In particular, the SEC’s order states that JKHY failed to properly record 
and report revenue from its software license sales in the correct accounting periods because it:  
(1) improperly separated contracts so closely related that they should have been considered to be 
parts of a single arrangement; and (2) prematurely recognized revenue from sales of software 
given its lack of vendor-specific objective evidence of the fair value of undelivered services 
related to implementation and post-contract support.  Also according to the SEC’s order, JKHY’s 
failures in these areas were caused by inadequate internal controls surrounding revenue 
recognition. 
 
The SEC’s order finds that JKHY violated Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder.  
Without admitting or denying the findings of the SEC’s order, JKHY agreed to a cease-and-
desist order and a civil penalty totaling $780,000.  
 
The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Donald A. Ryba and Robin Andrews and supervised 
by Amy S. Cotter of the Chicago Regional Office.
