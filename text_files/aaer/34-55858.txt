              On the basis of this Order and Respondents Offer, the Commission finds1
                                                                                  that:   
  
                                          Respondent 
 
       IBM, a New York corporation based in Armonk, New York, is a world-wide information 
technology corporation.  IBMs stock is registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act.  
IBM stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange, Chicago Stock Exchange, Pacific Stock 
Exchange, and on other exchanges in the United States and around the world. 
        
                                            Summary 
                                                  
              This matter involves a misleading chart presented by IBM during an April 5, 2005 
conference call with analysts, which was simultaneously webcast, and included in a Form 8-K filed 
with the Commission, relating to the impact that the companys decision to expense employee 
stock options would have on its first quarter 2005 (1Q05) and fiscal year 2005 (FY05) 
earnings results.  
  
              During the conference call, IBM announced that beginning in 1Q05 it would report stock 
options as an expense in its financial statements and advised analysts to adjust their earnings 
models to account for the change.  At the time, IBM expected that its stock options expense for 
1Q05 would have a $0.10 impact on first quarter earnings per share results and estimated a $0.39 
impact on FY05 earnings per share results.  IBM did not disclose this information during the 
conference call or in its subsequently filed Form 8-K.  IBM included a misleading chart in its 
presentation which was understood by many analysts to indicate that the earnings per share impact 
of the stock options expense would be $0.14 for 1Q05 and $0.55 for FY05, thereby causing 
analysts to lower their 1Q05 and FY05 earnings per share estimates by these amounts.  By 
engaging in this conduct, IBM violated the reporting provisions of the federal securities laws.   
 
                                           Discussion 
        
              On April 5, 2005, one week after the SEC staff issued SAB 107 (regarding the reporting of 
employee stock options as an expense), and less than two weeks before IBM released its 1Q05 
financial results, IBM announced that it would begin to report employee stock options as an 
expense in its financial statements for 1Q05.  During the presentation (the text of which was filed 
with the Commission in a Form 8-K), IBM also advised analysts to update their 2004 models, for 
comparability, and their 2005 models to reflect the change.  IBM explained to analysts that they 
should reduce their 2004 earnings per share figures by $0.14 for the first quarter and by $0.55 for 
the year, which were the actual amounts of stock options expense that IBM had disclosed in its 
2004 pro-forma disclosures.  IBM also said (t)his is an accounting change and does not impact 
underlying business dynamics.  Therefore, for purposes of your models, updated 2005 expectations 
should reflect the same level of year-to-year profit improvement as current estimates.   
 
              Furthermore, IBM said that it had taken steps that would result in lower stock options 
expense for 2005 compared to their 2004 pro-forma expense and that   any savings would be used to 
offset a previously announced $1 billion year-to-year increase in pension expense for 2005.

 The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent's Offer of Settlement and are not binding on any other 
person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

During IBMs January 2005 earnings announcement, IBM had said that for 2005 it expected a $1 
billion year-to-year increase in its pension expense.  This was approximately $200 million more 
than the $800 million year-to-year increase IBM had anticipated for 2005 and had announced in 
October 2004.  IBM had also said in January that it would take steps over the course of 2005 to 
overcome the $1 billion year-to-year increase in its pension expense.  IBM identified divesting the 
PC business, redesigning (its) equity program with premium priced options, and globalizing 
(its) business as actions it would take to help overcome the increased pension expense.     
 
              During the April 5, 2005 conference call, IBMs management did not make any statements 
about the amount by which analysts should reduce their 2005 estimates to account for options 
expensing.  IBM did present a chart which many analysts read to indicate that the stock option 
expense would reduce 1Q05 and FY05 earnings per share estimates by $0.14 and $0.55, 
respectively.  At the time, IBM expected that its stock options expense would have only a $0.10 
impact on 1Q05 earnings per share results, or $0.04 less than the first quarter 2004 pro-forma 
expense, and IBM estimated that its stock option expense would have only a $0.39 impact on 
FY05 earnings per share results, or $0.16 less than the pro-forma amount for the full year 2004.  
IBM did not disclose this information during the April 5 announcement or in its Form 8-K.  
 
       Although IBM considered disclosing that its 1Q05 stock options expense would be $0.03 to 
$0.04 less than the first quarter 2004 pro-forma expense, management rejected the idea due, at least 
in part, to concern that analysts would add back the year-to-year reduction to their earnings per 
share estimates instead of using the reduction to offset the increase in pension expense.  
Management wanted to avoid this because it would have increased the expected growth rate that 
analysts had set for IBM, which would have been difficult for the company to achieve because of 
the year-to-year increase in pension expense.  However, as discussed above, the amount of the 
increase in IBMs pension expense for 2005 had been disclosed in October 2004 and updated in 
January 2005 and, therefore, had been available for analysts to factor into their 2005 models.   
 
              After IBMs April 5 announcement, many analysts reduced their earnings per share 
estimates for 2005 by the same amount as the 2004 pro-forma expense, $0.14 for 1Q05 and $0.55 
for FY05.  The average of analysts earnings per share estimates was reduced to $0.90 for 1Q05 
and to $5.07 for FY05.  Many analysts reports reflected that IBMs earnings per share estimates 
were lowered by $0.14 and $0.55 per share for 1Q05 and FY05, respectively, to account for stock 
options expenses.   
 
              On April 14, 2005, after the markets close, IBM announced its 1Q05 financial results.  The 
announcement of 1Q05 results was formerly scheduled for April 18, 2005.  IBM disclosed 
earnings of $0.85 per share, which was $0.05 less than the amount that many analysts were 
expecting following the April 5 presentation.  IBM also disclosed that its equity compensation 
expense was $0.10 per share for 1Q05, or $0.04 lower than what many analysts had understood 
IBMs April 5 misleading chart to have indicated it would be.  IBMs stock price dropped $6.94 
the next day, or over 8%, closing at $76.33.

              Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13a-11 thereunder require issuers of registered 
securities to file certain reports.  15 U.S.C. § 78m(a); 17 C.F.R. § 240.13a-11.  Under Rule 13a-11, 
issuers are required to file current reports on material corporate developments on Form 8-K.  17 
C.F.R. § 240.13a-11.  In addition, issuers may choose to file certain reports on Form 8-K, as was 
done in this matter.  Exchange Act Rule 12b-20 requires, in addition to information required to be 
in a report, any material information necessary to make the required statements, in the light of the 
circumstances under which they are made not misleading.  17 C.F.R. § 240.12b-20.  Information 
is material if there is a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have 
been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of 
information made available.  Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 231-32 (1988) (quoting TSC 
Indus., Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U.S. 438, 449 (1976)).  Information regarding a companys 
earnings is one of the most important considerations in making an investment decision. 
         
        IBM violated the above reporting provisions by filing with the Commission a materially 
misleading Form 8-K.  The filing contained materially misleading information about the amount of 
IBMs stock options expense and the impact it would have on IBMs earnings per share.  The 
Form 8-K created the impression that IBMs stock options expense would be greater than what 
IBM actually expected it to be for 1Q05 and FY05.  In light of the    statements made in the Form 8-
K, IBM should have also included in its Form 8-K additional information it knew at the time 
relating to its stock options expense for 1Q05 and FY05, (i.e., that it expected the expense to have 
a $0.10 impact on earnings per share in 1Q05, and that it estimated the expense to have a $0.39 
impact on earnings per share for FY05).  By failing to include this information in its disclosure, 
IBM violated Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-11 thereunder.   
  
                                                  IV. 
                                                     
        In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in Respondent IBMs Offer. 
 
        Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that: 
 
 Respondent IBM cease            and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future 
violations of Sections 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-11 thereunder.
