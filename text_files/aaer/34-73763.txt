18                        
           Accounting firm and its sole proprietor willfully violated the antifraud provisions of the 
19 
    federal securities laws by issuing false audit reports.  Held, it is in the public interest to 
20   permanently deny respondents the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission as 
    accountants, impose a cease-and-desist order, order disgorgement of $112,529, plus prejudgment 
21   interest, and assess a $110,500 civil penalty.

    APPEARANCES:

           Scott W. Hatfield, CPA, pro se and for S.W. Hatfield, CPA.

              The Division of Enforcement appeals from the decision of an administrative law judge 
 1 
      dismissing a proceeding brought pursuant to Sections 4C(a)(1) and (3), 21B, and 21C of the 

 2   Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 102(e)(1)(i) and (iii) of the Commission's Rules of 
      Practice and based on allegations that Respondents willfully violated the antifraud provisions of 
 3                                   1
      the federal securities laws.      The law judge found that     the Division failed to allege that    S.W. 
      Hatfield, CPA    ("the Firm")  , a Te  xas accounting fi  rm, and Scott W. Hatfield, the F     irm's sole 
 4 
      proprietor  (together, " Respondents")    ,  made misrepresentations     with respect to   certain   audit 

 5    reports   that  Respondents  issued   while the F irm  was not in possession of a state license to do so      .  
      Accordingly, the law judge      found that ther  e was no basis for sanctioning R      espondents.     
 6             
              W e  base our findings on an independent review of the record, except with respect to 
 7 
      those findings not challenged on appeal       .  We find that the legal conclusions on whi      ch the law 

 8    judge based her dismissal were incorrect.  We further find that the Division met its burden under 
      Rule   of Practice 250 to show that "there is no genuine issue with regard to any material fact" and 
 9                                                                             2
      that it "is entitled to a summary disposition as      a matter of law."       We find that Respondents 
      willfully violated the antifraud provisions and that certain sanctions are in the public interest.           
10 
               

11   I.       Background 
                                                               
12            A.       Respondents issued thirty-eight audit reports for twenty-one public company 
                       issuers while the Firm was not licensed by the State of Texas. 
13 
       

14            The underlying facts are largely undisputed.  Hatfield has been licensed by the Texas 
      State Board of Public Accountancy ("TSBPA") as a certified public accountant ("CPA") since 
15   1985.  He is the Firm's sole officer, director, and accountant.  The Firm has been licensed by the 
      TSBPA as a CPA firm since 1994, and Hatfield renewed the Firm's license annually through 
16 
      January 2009.  At the relevant times, the Firm also was registered with the Public Company 

17   Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB").   
       
18            In a letter dated October 9, 2009, the TSBPA notified Respondents that the Firm's license 
      for 2010 would not be issued because the Firm had failed to report peer review results as 
19                                                            3
      required by the TSBPA's Peer Review Program.               T he letter instructed Hatfield   to complete and 

20    submit an "Affidavit     for Exemption from Peer Review        "  if he believed that the  Firm  was exemp    t 
      from undergoing a peer review.        If, for example, a CPA firm has issuer clients only,        the  firm can 
21

      office license shall not be renewed unless the office has met the peer review requirements as 
25   defined in Chapter 527 of this title" (relating to Peer Review)).  The Peer Review Program 
      monitors firms' compliance with applicable accounting, auditing, and other attestation standards 
26 
      adopted by generally recognized standard-setting bodies.  The program includes education, 

27   remediation, disciplinary sanctions, or other corrective action when a firm is not in compliance.

                                                               3 

      claim an exemption and instead satisfy the peer review requirement by having the PCAOB 
 1 
      conduct an inspection and provide a report to the TSBPA stating that the peer review had been 

 2   completed.  Although Respondents claim the Firm had only issuer clients, they did not submit 
      such an affidavit.  In fact, the PCAOB had been investigating Respondents since 2008, and 
 3   Respondents could not provide the TSBPA with the requisite assurances that the PCAOB 
      inspection process had been completed.  Hatfield did not claim any exemption.  By the end of 
 4 
      2009, the TSBPA notified Respondents in writing that the Firm's license would expire on 

 5   January 31, 2010.  
       
 6             On March 8, 2010, the TSBPA sent an e-mail to Ronald Johnson, a Firm affiliate, stating 
      that the Firm's license was delinquent and expired.  On that same date, Johnson forwarded that e-
 7 
      mail to Hatfield at his e-mail address on file with the TSBPA, asking "What is up with this?"  At 

 8   about the same time, a TSBPA attorney informed Respondents' attorney by telephone that the 
      Firm's license was expired, the Firm was three years delinquent in satisfying peer review 
 9   requirements, and Respondents could be sanctioned for providing attest services without a valid 
               4
      license.     T he TSBPA sent a letter to    Respondents' attorney       on March 15, 2010,     stating that   
10 
      because it had recently learned      that the Firm had issuer clients only,       the Firm could satisfy its 

11    peer review by having the PCAOB inspect the Firm, and that the TSBPA would nee                      d to "receive 
      a letter from PCAOB sta      ting that all issues have been '    Satisfact orily Addressed'    by the firm."     In 
12    a letter dated  July 8, 2010, the TSBPA        again   advised  Respondents' counsel      that the Firm  could 
      not hold itself out as a   CPA  firm or perform audits or attestations because its license was 
13 
      delinquent and expired.  In May 2011, the TSBPA permitted the                Firm  to renew its license.    

14              
               From January 31, 2010 until May 19, 2011           ,  the period during which the     Firm 's l icense 
15    was expired    ("the Relevant Period")     ,  Respondents issued thirty    -eight audit reports   for  twenty  -one 
      public company issuers.        Each audit report   was issued    on  letterhead titled,  "S.W. Hatfield, CPA," 
16 
      and was signed by Hatfield on behalf of the          Firm  as "S.W. Hatfield, CPA."          The audit reports 

17    were included    , with Respondents' authorization      , in the issuers' periodic reports and registration 
                                                    5
      statements filed with the Commission.             Respondents charged     appr oximately    $200,000 in fees 
18    for audits conduc    ted or completed while the Firm was not in possession of a valid license             .     
                
19 
               B.       The Commission instituted proceedings. 

20    
               On September 6, 2012, the Commission issued a Corrected Order Instituting Proceedings 
21   ("OIP") alleging that Respondents willfully violated Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5

      5
27             We take official notice of the twenty      -one issuers' thirty  -eight periodic reports and 
      registration statements cited in this opinion pursuant to Rule 323           .   17 C.F.R. § 201.323.

                                                                          4 

                      6                                                                                              7
       thereunder       and  did not possess the requisite qualifications to represent others                       .   The OIP 
 1 
       authorized, if appropriate, the imposition of sanctions under Exchange Act Section                                   4C(a)(1) and       

 2     (3) and Rule 102(e)(1)(i) and (iii); and Exchange Act Section                         s  21B and     21C.    The Division 

       moved      for summary disposition pursuant to Rule of Practice 250                        . 
 3      

                  In dismissing the proceeding, t            he law judge found that           the Firm was       not licensed     during 
 4 
       the  Relevant Period        .  The law judge determined that because the Firm was unlicensed when it 

 5     issued the thirty     -eight audit reports, the reports were signed by a CPA that was "not state                            -

       licensed and in good standing" contrary to the requirements of Regulation S                               -X.   Accordingly       , the 
 6     law judge concluded that            "the issuers who included [the Firm]'s audit reports with their filings 

       violated the Exchange Act and Securities Act reporting provisions, and Hatfield and [the Firm] 
 7 
       were secondarily l        iable for [those]      violations    "  (which wer     e not charged in the OIP).             But  the law 

 8     judge also     determined       that "there is no allegation that the audit reports or the financial statements 

       that were the subject of the audit reports contained misrepresentations, much                                less that 
 9     Respondents were in any wa              y liable for misrepresentations in the reports and financial 

       statements."       The law judge concluded that              the "the allegation that Respondents violated 
10 
       E xchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b                   -5  is unproven     ."  

11                 

                  The law judge       found   that there was        "no  basis for    sanctioning R       espondents pursuant to 
12     Rule 102     (e)(1)(iii)"   in light of her determination            that the   Division failed to allege that 
                                                             8
       R espondents       made misrepresentations            .    The law judge also        foun  d that there was no basis for 
13 
       sanctioning      R espondents under R          ule 102(    e )(1)(  i) because,   "[t]o the extent that Rule 102(e)(1)(i) 

14     is referenced in any l       itigated case, it is associated          with Rule 102(e)(1)(iii) and a respondent's 

       having willfully violated the federal securities laws.                      There is no litigated case in which a 
15     respondent was sanctioned pursuant to Rule 102(e)(1)(i) alone.                          "    This appeal followed.         

                   
16 
       II.        The Law Judge's Dismissal Was Improper. 

17                                                                         

                  Rule 250(a) permits a law judge to consider and rule on a motion for summary 
18     disposition at any time after a respondent files an answer and the Division has made its 
                                                                                                     9
       documents available to that respondent for inspection and copying.                                A law judge may grant a 
19 
       motion f    or summary disposition if there is no genuine issue with regard to any material fact and 
                                                                                                                            10
20     the party making the motion is entitled to a summary disposition as a matter of law.                                      Where the 

       Division is the moving party and the law judge determines that the Div                             ision has not met the 
21

                  The OIP was reissued in November 2012 to correct a clerical error.                              

       8
24                The law judge did not mention Exchange Act Section                          21B or    21C in reaching her 

       disposition, but, without a finding that Respondents violated                        or were a cause of any securit            ies 
25     laws violations      , there   would be      no basis for sanctions under            those   provision    s  either.

     standard for summary disposition under Rule 250, and where a respondent has not filed its own 
 1 
     Rule 250 motion, our rules make no express provision for the law judge to sua sponte dismiss the 

 2   proceeding without a hearing, as the law judge did here.  Rather, the language of Rule 250(b) 
     directing the law judge to either grant or deny the motion, together with language in the OIP 
 3   ordering "that a public hearing for the purpose of taking evidence on the questions set forth in 
     [the OIP] shall be convened" suggests that, in the circumstances here, a law judge's only 
 4 
     alternative to granting the motion is to deny it and proceed with a hearing.  At the very least, if a 

 5   law judge concludes that it may be necessary to summarily dismiss a proceeding as a matter of 
     law, the parties should be provided notice and an opportunity to be heard as to the possible basis 
 6                           11
     for such a disposition.      Here, t  he Division had no notice either from the law judge, or through

 8            
             O n this record, we do not find it necessary to remand    to  the law judge for  a hearing.  The 
 9   record before us   supports our conclusion that the law j  udge's dismissal was incorrect as a matter 
                                                                                   12

             Although we are not governed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,         those rules 

12   sometimes provide helpful guidance     .  See Robert M. Ryerson, Exchange Act Release No. 57839,  
     2008 WL 2117161, at *5 (May 20, 2008) ("Under certain circumstances, the Federal Rules of 
13   Civil Procedure provide helpful guidance, such as when issues are not directly addressed by our 
     Rules of Practice.") (citation omitted).  We note that a federal district court may respond to a 
14 
     motion for summary judgment by granting summary judgment sua sponte in a nonmoving party's 

15   favor, but only if the court provides the losing party with adequate notice about the issue 
     ultimately decided against that party and an opportunity to address that issue.  See Celotex Corp. 
16   v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 326 (1986) (stating that "district courts are widely acknowledged to 
     possess the power to enter summary judgments sua sponte, so long as the losing party was on 
17 
     notice that she had to come forward with all of her evidence"); see also Advantage Consulting 

18   Grp., Ltd. v. ADT Sec. Sys., Inc., 306 F.3d 582, 588 (8th Cir. 2002) (finding that the district court 
     did not err when it granted summary judgment sua sponte and stating that "[t]he court has 
19   inherent power to grant dispositive motions sua sponte so long as the losing party was on notice

21   F.3d 215, 222-23 (3d Cir. 2004) (finding that, although there is authority for a court to grant 
     summary judgment to the nonmoving party, a court should not do so without "first placing the 
22   adversarial party on notice that the court is considering a sua sponte summary judgment motion" 
     and finding that notice means "that the targeted party had reason to believe the court might reach 
23 
     the issue and received a fair opportunity to put its best foot forward" (internal quotation marks

     conclusion in the Initial Decision, the Division did allege that the audit reports contained 
 1 
     misrepresentations.  The OIP alleges that Respondents knew they were not permitted to act as 

 2   CPAs because the Firm's license had expired and that Hatfield nonetheless "knowingly signed 
     the firm's name [as CPAs] to each audit report [the Firm] issued during the period [the Firm's] 
 3   license was expired."  In its brief in support of its motion for summary disposition, the Division 
     devoted two pages to a discussion of these misrepresentations, stating specifically that "inclusion 
 4 
     of an audit report issued by a person not recognized as an accountant is a material misstatement," 
 5   along with citation to authority, and that "[i]mplicit in each of SWH's audit reports issued 
     between January 31, 2010 and May 19, 2011 was the representation to each issuer that SWH was 
 6   recognized as a CPA under the federal securities laws and qualified and permitted to issue audit 
     reports on its clients' financial statements."  Respondents' opposition to the Division's motion 
 7 
     argued that the issuers, not they, actually made the alleged misrepresentations; that Hatfield's 
 8   signature on the audit reports during the Relevant Period was not material due to the "technical 
     and administrative" reason for their license having lapsed; and that because they purportedly 
 9   made good-faith efforts to renew their license, they did not have the requisite scienter for fraud.  
     We address, and reject, these arguments below, but the fact that Respondents made them 
10 
     demonstrates that they understood what misrepresentations they were alleged to have made.  
11            
             The law judge also incorrectly concluded that Rule 102(e)(1)(i) cannot stand alone as a 
12   basis for sanctioning Respondents.  The plain language separating the subparts of Rule 102(e)(1) 
     uses the disjunctive "or," meaning that any one basis in the rule is sufficient to establish the 
13 
     Commission's authority to proceed.  Such a reading is consistent with our previous determination 
14   that "Rule 102(e)(1) provides that a person may be denied the privilege of appearing or 
                                                                                                 13
     practicing before the Commission once the Commission makes one of three findings . . . ."       
15   Whether   all prior matters brought under Rule 102(e)(1)(i) also have been brought under Rule 
     102(e)(1)(iii) is not dispositive. 
16 
              
17   III.    Respondents Willfully Violated Exchange Act Section 10(b) and  
             Rule 10b-5(b) Thereunder. 
18                                                     
             To establish liability under Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder, 
19 
     the Division must show by a preponderance of the evidence that Respondents made a 
20   misrepresentation or omission, that such misrepresentation or omission was material, that the 
     Respondents acted with scienter, and that the conduct was made in connection with the purchase

      misrep  resentations, she did not         address   the  parties' arguments re      garding    any of   the  other   
 3    elements     necessary to impose sanctions          .   We address th    os e elements here     .   

       
 4 
                A.        Respondents made misrepresentations. 

 5    

                Under Commission rules, a signature on an audit report is a representation that the signer 
 6   is a CPA.  Exchange Act Section 13(a) requires that financial statements filed with the 
                                                                     15
      Commission be certified by a public accountant.                     That certification occurs i     n the form of an 
 7 
      audit report    in which     the  CPA   expresses an opinion about whether an issuer's financial 

 8    statements fairly present the issuer's financial position in conformity with generally accepted 
                                   16
      accounting      principles  .     U nder Rule 1   -02(a) of Regulatio      n S -X,  an audit report must be prepared 
 9                  17
      by  a CPA.        Rule 2  -01(a) of Regulation S       -X  provides that     CPAs   are only those       accountants     
                                                                                                            18
      " duly registered and in good standing" in the jurisdiction in which they reside.                          If a person   
10 
      issues an audit report as to a public          issuer's financial statements, that person impliedly is stating 

11    that he is a   CPA   within the meaning of Regulation S              -X.   And if   such   person signs    the  audit 

      report using the title CPA, that person is expressly stating that he is a CPA within the meaning of 
12    Regulation S     -X.  

                 
13 
                From   January 2010 until May 2011            , when    Respondents      were not duly registered and in 

14    good standing in       Texas,   the jurisdiction in     which   they resided    ,  they   issued thirty -eight audit 

      reports that were included in documents filed               with the Commission pursuant to Regulation S                 -X 
15    by twenty    -one issuers    .   As the Division argued, it was implicit in the filing of t            hese audit reports     

      that they were signed by a         CPA   because     they   were issued with issuers' financial statements filed 
16 
      pursuant to Regulation S         -X.  In fact,  in  the signature line and heading         , Respondents explicitly 

17    represented that they were         CPAs  .   The representation       s  in the thirty -eight audit repo    rts that 

      Respondents were CPAs            on the dates the reports were          issued   were   false.

                Respondents argue they did not make the alleged misrepresentations.                            They   argue that 
 1 
      "because they did not have 'ultimate authority' over the                 statements, the Respondents were not 

 2    makers of t    hose statements       for purposes     of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b          -5 (b) ,"  citing Janus 
                                                                     20
      Capital Group, Inc. v. First Derivative Traders.                   Janus involved a private civil action alleging 
 3   claims under Exchange Act Rule 10b-5 based on misrepresentations made in prospectuses filed 
      with the Commission by Janus Investment Fund, a mutual fund company.  The plaintiffs alleged 
 4 
      that Janus Capital Management ("JCM"), the fund's investment adviser and administrator, 

 5   committed fraud because it had been significantly involved in the creation of the 
                                21
      misrepresentations.            The Court held that "the maker of a           statement is the entity with authority 
 6                                                                                                      22
      over the content o      f the statement and whether and how to communicate it."                        The Court found 
      that "attribution within a statement or implicit from surrounding circumstances is strong 
 7                                                                                                                          23
      evidence that a statement was made by              —and only by—the party to whom it is attributed."                       The  

 8    Court found that JCM did not have ultimate control over the mis                     representations      and therefore did 
                                                                                     24
      not make the mi      srepresentations      for purposes of      Rule 10b    -5.   
 9               
                In stark contrast to the      Janus facts, Respondents drafted, dated, printed on Firm 
10 
      letterhead, and signed thirty-eight audit reports that were included in documents filed with the 

11   Commission by twenty-one issuers.  Under Regulation S-X, it is the CPA—and only the CPA—
      who has the authority over the content of the audit report and whether such audit report is issued 
12

14    19
                Respondents have not filed any briefs or otherwise participated in the appeal before us.    
      The Office of the Secretary notified Respondents in a letter dated June 26, 2014 that 
15 
      Respondents failed to file two briefs due in this appeal on December 23, 2013                          and April 28, 

16    2014, respectively.  The letter noted that, on December 27, 2013, Respondents' counsel filed a 
      Notice of Withdrawal as counsel and, in that notice, stated that it had sent Respondents all the 
17    pleadings in this matter, along with a copy of the               notice.  The letter explained that, pursuant to 
      Rule 180(c), 17 C.F.R. § 201.180(c), the Commission may "decide the particular matter at issue 
18 
      against that person . . . if a person fails . . . to make a filing required under these Rules of 

19    Practice."  The      letter further explained that the Commission was deliberating and "could affirm, 
      reverse and remand the proceeding to the law judge, or reverse and find against [Respondents] in 
20    a final order."  Respondents were instructed to contact the Office of the Sec                      retary if they 
      intended to file any document in this matter,              but they did not reply.  O       ur discussion of 
21 
      Respondents' arguments is based on pleadings in their opposition to the Division's motion for 

22    summary disposition below.

                The plaintiffs also alleged that JCM had a close relationship with the fund, exercised 
24 
      significant influence over the fund and its prospectus disclosures, and was understood by 

25    investors to be the "maker" of disclosures issued by the fund.

 5             A fact is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would have 
      considered the misstated or omitted fact important in making an investment decision and if

 2   services or representing that it was an accounting firm or CPA firm.                      Significantly, the reason 
      Respondents were not able to renew their license was because they                   failed to  comply with TSBPA 
 3    rules by   report ing   the results of   a   timely PCAOB      inspection  .  The PCAOB's report        was 
      important to show that       investors could rely on Respondents' professional expertise                by 
 4 
      demonstrating that       they   were in compliance with applicable accounting, auditing, and other 

 5    attestation standards.      Moreover, a reasonable investor would want to know that an audit report 
      was signed by someone who            had been     expressly  informed      by the TSBPA, a state licensing 
 6    authority, that he    was not legally authorized to        issue  such an   audit report     because he had not

 7 
                 

 8              Respondents     argue    that the  misrepresentations are not material.  They          urge    that the  "best 
      and most probative evidence of materiality would be what an investor actually said regarding the 
 9    importance of the supposedly false or omitted information in question" and that the Division 
      failed to of  fer any evidence on this point.  But "the react         ion of individual investors is not

 1 
      The qualification of a CPA to render an opinion about            an issuer's  financial statements is    and has 

 2    been   a fundamental aspe    ct of an investor's decision about whether to        invest in an issuer   since the 
      adoption   of the Exchange Act in 1934       . 
 3     
               Respondents state that, "due to the technical and         administrative nature of the [F     irm's] 
 4 
      temporary license revocation, it is unreasonable and factually unsupported to assume the 

 5    materialit y of this revocation's non    -disclosure to investors in the issuer companies."         But the 
      expiration   was  neither   technical nor administrative    .  As demonstrated above, i     t  was  based   on 
 6    Respondents' failure to     meet a requirement that goes to the heart of a CPA's          competency      and  
      highlighted the fact that the PCAOB, a regulatory body uniquely qualified to evaluate a CPA 
 7 
      firm's fitness to practice  , had not yet   resolved with the Respondents the significant audit 
                                                                           33

10 
               The Supreme Court has defined scienter as "a mental state embracing intent to deceive, 
                                   34
11   manipulate, or defraud."           Scienter includes recklessness, defined as conduct that is "an extreme 
      departure from the standards of ordinary care         , . . . which presents a danger of misleading buyers 
12    or sellers that is  either known to the [respondent] or       is  so obvious that the [respondent] must

              Respondents knew by at least March 8, 2010 that the Firm's license had not been renewed 
 1                                                                                                        36
      because that is when Hatfield received an email from the TSBPA expressly saying so.                      Also in 

 2    March, the   TSBPA     informed   Respondents' counsel      tha t, while   Respondents'  license was expired,    
      they were not permitted to hold themselves out as CPAs and issue audit reports.               The TSBPA 
 3    reiterated this message to counsel in writing four months later.           
               
 4 
              Even before March 8, 2010, Respondents were at lea            st reckless  in misrepresenting their 

 5    status  .  Respondents had been in the industry for over fifteen years        and knew that the Firm had       to 
      renew its license annually.  It is implausible that Respondents did not know that having a valid 
 6    license was a prerequisite for    holding themselves out as CPAs        .  Moreover, b  eginning in October 
      2009, well before the Firm's license expired, the TSBPA bega            n to  expressly notify Respondents 
 7 
      through letters, e -mails, and telephone calls about the Firm's impending license expiration, the 

 8    options Respondents had for renewing the Firm's license, and the consequences of                not renewing 
      the license.  Respondents acted      with  no care when they held themselves out as CPAs, and the 
 9   danger of deceiving investors about their qualifications could not have been more obvious. 
               
10 
              Respondents argue that they did not act with scienter because there is no evidence that 

11   they acted with the specific, or even reckless, intent to deceive investors.  Citing Sundstrand 
      Corp. v. Sun Chemical Corp. and Alvin W. Gebhart, Respondents assert that "recklessness 
12   requires that the allegedly fraudulent material omission or misstatement 'derive from something 
                                                                                37
      more egregious than even 'white heart/empty head' good faith,'"              and that we must "'look at an 
13                                                                              38
      actor's actual state of mind at the time of the relevant conduct.'"            Respondents assert that they 

14    tried repeatedly in good faith to have the PCAOB comp           lete its inspection   and maintained 
      constant  contact with the PCAOB and TSBPA             regarding the status of the Firm's license.        
15             
              When the defendant is aware of the facts that         made the statement misleading, "'      he cannot 
16                                                             39
      ignore the facts a  nd plead ignorance of t   he risk.'"    Notwithstanding any efforts      Respondents

21    37
              Sundstrand, 553 F.2d at 1045.  The Sundstrand court explained that recklessness includes 

22   subjective and objective components.  The objective component is satisfied if the facts 
      demonstrate that the danger of deceiving investors was known or so obvious that it would be 
23   known to any reasonable person.  The subjective component is satisfied if the facts demonstrate 
      something more than "'white heart/empty head' good faith" or "inexcusable negligence."  Id.

 5                    securities. 
      
 6                                                                                     40
              The "in connection with" requirement is meant to be read broadly.             The requirement can 
     be satisfied by statements made in p    ublic filings with the Commission, such as Forms 10       -K and 
 7                             41
     registration statements.       During the pendency of this appeal,   we requested supplemental 

 8   briefing from the   parties   to  address  , among other things, in what way any of   the thirty-eight audit 
                                                                                                            42
     reports are "in connection with" the purchases or sales of securiti     es of the twenty  -one issuers.

                                                                     43

                                                         15 

              We find that the misstatements in the thirteen audit reports listed above are "in 
 1 
     connection with" the purchase or sale of securities and that, the other elements of the violation 

 2   having been met, Respondents violated Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.   
               
 3           E.       Respondents' violations were willful. 
      
 4 
              Under Exchange Act Section 4C(a)(3) and Rule 102(e)(1)(iii), the Commission may  

 5    
              censure a person or deny, temporarily or permanently, the privilege of appearing 
 6            or practicing before it in any way to any person who is found by the Commission 
              after notice and opportunity for hearing in the matter . . . to have willfully 
 7 
              violated, or willfully aided and abetted the violation of any provision of the 
 8            federal securities laws or the rules and regulations thereunder.   
               
 9   We have found that Respondents violated the federal securities laws.  The question here is 
     whether Respondents did so willfully.   
10 
      
11            It is well established that a willful violation of the securities laws means "intentionally 
     committing the act which constitutes the violation" and does not require that the actor "also be 
12                                                            44
     aware that he is violating one of the Rules or Acts."         T here is no dispute that Respondents 
     intentionally identified themselves as CPAs in audit reports that they issued for inclusion in 
13 
     public filings.  Respondents argue that their "mental state in permitting SWH's license to lapse 
14   and in issuing any relevant   audit reports during that time was far less than intentional or the 
     result of any willfulness on their part."   But the record  evidence   contradicts their argument.  
15   Respondents also argue that     "there is no evidence that the Respondents acted willfully, that     is, 
     with the specific intent to deceive investors or potential investors."      The intent to deceive, i.e., 
16 
     scienter, is different from the intent to the commit the act, i.e., willfulness, and we have 
17   addressed Respondents' scienter above.  We thus reject Respondents' arguments and find that 
     Respondents acted willfully.  
18             
              Accordingly, for all of the above reasons, we find that there is no genuine issue with 
19 
     regard to any material fact and that the Division is entitled to a summary disposition as a matter 
20   of law that Respondents willfully violated Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 
     thereunder within the meaning of Exchange Act Section 4C(a)(3) and Rule 102(e)(1)(iii). 
21             
     IV.      Sanctions 
22 
                                                            
23           A.       Respondents are denied the privilege of appearing or practicing before the 
                      Commission under Exchange Act Section 4C(a)(3) and Rule 102(e)(1)(iii). 
24 
      
              In assessing the need for sanctions in the public interest, we consider, among other 
25 
     things:  the egregiousness of the respondent's actions, the isolated or recurrent nature of the 
26 
                                                      
     44
27            Wonsover v. SEC, 205 F.3d 408, 414 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (internal quotation marks and 
     citation omitted).

      infraction, the degree of scienter involved, the sincerity of the respondent's assurances against 
 1 
      future violations, the respondent's recognition of the wrongful nature of his or her conduct, and 

 2   the likelihood that the respondent's occupation will present opportunities for future violations. 
                                                                                                                45
      Our "inquiry into . . . the public interest is a flexible one, and no one factor is dispositive."              We 
 3                                                                                           46
      also consider the extent to which the sanction will have a deterrent effect.                 
                
 4 
               Respondents'    actions were egregious and recurrent.  They repeatedly issued audit reports 

 5    for over one year while the Firm       failed to possess a   license   despite knowing they were prohibited 
      from doing so.  Respondents concealed          the truth  from the investing public by issui     ng such audit 
 6    reports  despite knowing that they were prohibited from doing so            , and thus acted with a high 
      degree of scienter.  Respondents make no assurances against future violations and do not 
 7 
      recognize the wrongful nature of their conduct.  In fact, Res         pondents continue to blame the 

 8    PCAOB for the license expiration, asserting that "it was in no way             [their]   fault or responsibility . 
      . .  ."    Respondents ignore that  they  are the only ones responsible for     issuing audit reports    despite 
 9    not  holding a valid firm license    .   We find that Respondents' callous disregard for        such a basic 
      regulatory requirement      as the necessity of hav   ing a license to practice as a certified public 
10 
      accountant   demonstrates that there is a high likelihood that they will         commit future violations.       

11              
               On July 3, 2013,    following Respondents' appeal of a separate disciplinary proceeding by 
12    the PCAOB regarding conduct unrelated to this proceeding,              we sustained    PCAOB's decision to 
      revoke the Firm's    PCAOB      registration and permane     ntly bar Hatfield from association with a 
13                                            47
      registered public accounting firm.           But those sanctions do not prohibit Respondents from 

14    appearing and practicing before the Commission in other capacities, such as working in an 
                                                                                       48
      accounting capacity for     Commission     -registered investment advisers.           As we have stated, "[t]he

      its processes.'"       We  find  that permanently disqualifying       Respondents      from appearing o     r 

 2    practicing before the Commission is remedial because it will prevent                 Respondents     and deter 
      others from disregarding their professional responsibilities and protect the investing public by 
 3    encouraging diligent compliance with           regulatory requirements.         Bec ause we have found that a 
      bar  under   Exchange Act Section 4C(a)(3) and           Rule 102(e)(1)(iii) is in the public interest, we do 
 4 
      not reach the need for a sanction under         Exchange Act Section 4C(a)(1) and            Rule 102(e)(1)(i).    

 5              
               B.       A cease-and-desist order is warranted.                  
 6    
               Exchange Act Section 21C(a) authorizes us to impose a cease-and-desist order on any 
 7                                                                                                                   50
      person who is violating, has violated, or is about to violate that Act or any rule thereunder.                      In 

 8    determining whether a cease        -and -desist or  der is   appropriate, we consider, in addition to the 
      factors above, "whether the violation is recent, the degree of harm to investors or the marketplace 
 9    resulting from the violation, and the remedial function to be served by the cease                 -and -desist order 
                                                    51
      in the conte  xt of any other sanctions."           
10 
       

11             We conclude that a cease       -and -desist order is necessary.  The violations are recent, having 
      occurred from 2010 to 2011.          Although the record does not identify         any  pecuniary    harm to 
12                                                                                                                   52
      investors, our public interest analysis "fo       cus[es] . . . on the welfare of investors generally."            
      Investors and the marketplace are harmed when              a purported CPA       misrepresent   s  his  qualification 
13 
      to opine on an issuer's financial statements because such conduct undermines the reliability of 

14    fundamenta    l investment tools that help investors make informed decisions.                  We conclude that 
      Respondents pose a substantial, continuing risk of harm to investors and the marketplace.  A 
15    cease  -and -desist order   will serve the remedial purpose of encouraging Respondents to 
      understand and obey their obligations under the securities laws.

               C.        Disgorgement, plus prejudgment interest, is appropriate. 
 1 
       

 2             Exchange Act Section 21C(e) authorizes disgorgement, including reasonable 
                                                                          53
      prejudgment interest, in a cease-and-desist proceeding.                  Disgorgement is an equitable remedy 
 3    designed to deprive wrongdoers of their unjust enrichment and deter others from similar 
                     54
      misconduct.         Accordingly, "   [t]he amount of disgorgement should           include all gains flowi     ng 
 4 
      from the illegal activities," but calculating disgorgement "           requires only a reasonable 
                                                                                  55
 5    approximation of profits causally connected to            the violation."        Once the Division shows that its 
      disgorgement figure is a reasonable approxim            ation of the amount of unjust enrichment, the 
 6    burden shifts to the respondents to demonstrate that the Division's estimate is not a reasonable 
                         56
      approximatio    n.     Where dis   gorgement cannot be exact, the "well          -established principle"     is that 
 7 
      the burden of uncertainty in calculating ill        -gotten gains falls on the wrongdoer whose illegal 
                                              57
 8    con duct created that uncertainty.         
       
 9             The  record shows that      total  fees charged by Resp      o ndents   for the thirteen  reports   issued in 
      violation of the antifra    ud provisions    is $ 112,529.  We conclude that this amount represents a 
10                                                                            58
      reasonable approximation of Respondents' ill            -gotten gains.       Respondents have submitted no 

11    evidence to the contrary and therefore have not met their burden of showing that this estimate is 
      not a reasonable approximation.  We order Respondents to disgorge $112,529 plus prejudgment 
12              59
      interest.      Because the misconduct       committed by      Hatfield and the Firm      was inextricably

               The Division urges us to impose disgorgement of fees paid                 to  Respondents for all thirty    -
      eight audit reports at issue because such disgorgement "comports with prior Commission 
21 
      decisions in which unregistered auditors were required to disgorge audit fees for                   work performed 

22    in violation of Section 102(a) of the Sarbanes          -Oxley Act of 2002 . . . ."  But Respondents were 
      not charged with such a violation.  We order disgorgement here for violations charged and 
23    proven by the Division.

               D.       A second-tier civil monetary penalty is in the public interest. 
 3    
               Exchange Act Section 21B(a)(1)(A) authorizes us to impose a civil monetary penalty for 
 4                                                             61
      willful violations of the federal securities laws.           In  considering whether a civil penalty is       in the 

 5    public interest, we consider: whether the         conduct involved fraud or resulted in harm          to others; 
      the extent to which any person was unjustly enriched;             whether the individual has committed 
 6                                                                                                             62
      prior violations; the need for deterrence; and such other matters as justice may r              equire.      
      Second  -tier penalties are appropriate if the violation "invol        ved fraud, deceit, manipulation, or 
 7 
      deliberate or reckless disrega     rd of a regulatory requirement,      "  and third -tier penalties are 

 8    appropriate if  , in addition,  the violation    " directly or indirectly resulted in substantial losses or 
      created a significant risk    of substantial losses to other persons or resulted in substantial pecuniary 
 9                                                               63
      g ain to the person who committed"         the violation  .      
       
10 
               The Division     seeks a second   -tier penalty, and we find this appropriate.         As discussed 

11    above, Respondents' conduct involved fraud and deceit under the securities laws and undermined 
      the reliability of disclosure resources used by investors to make investment decisions.                  The 
12    record does not demonstrate any pecuniary loss to inves             tors, and Respondents' pecuniary gain 
      (i.e., the audit report fees) is not substantial.  Respondents' unjust enrichment also is not 
13 
      substantial.  Respondents have a disciplinary history and were sanctioned by the PCAOB for 

14   having engaged in improper professional conduct in the audit of the financial statements of two 
                            64
      public companies.          Respondents' misconduct       addressed    in the PCAOB proceeding, together 
15    with the misconduct here, demonstrates that the need for deterrence is high.
