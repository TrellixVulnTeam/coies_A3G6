In the Matter of                          ORDER INSTITUTING ADMINISTRATIVE

Verint Systems Inc.,                      PURSUANT TO SECTION 12(j) OF THE

Respondent.                                
 
                                              
 
                                            I. 
 
      The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it necessary and 
appropriate for the protection of investors that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby 
are, instituted pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange 
Act”) against Verint Systems Inc. (“Verint” or “Respondent”).  
                                              
                                           II. 
       
      After an investigation, the Division of Enforcement alleges that:  
 
      A.     Verint Systems Inc. (CIK No. 0001166388) is a Delaware corporation based in 
Melville, New York.  Verint’s common stock is registered with the Commission pursuant to 
Exchange Act Section 12(g) and is quoted on the “Pink Sheets” under the symbol “VRNT” or 
“VRNT.PK”.  Verint is required to file reports pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act. 
       
      B.     Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and the rules promulgated thereunder require 
issuers of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act to file with the 
Commission current and accurate information in periodic reports, even if the registration is 
voluntary under Section 12(g).  Specifically, Rule 13a-1 requires issuers to file annual reports  
(Forms 10-K or 10-KSB), and Rule 13a-13 requires issuers to file quarterly reports (Forms 10-Q 
or 10-QSB). 
 
      C.     Verint is delinquent in its periodic filings with the Commission. 
       
---------------------Page 2---------------------

       D.     Verint has not filed an annual report on either Form 10-K or Form 10-KSB since 
April 25, 2005, or quarterly reports on either Form 10-Q or Form 10-QSB since December 12, 
2005. 
 
       E.     As a result of the foregoing, Verint has failed to comply with Section 13(a) of the 
Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder. 
 
                                              III. 
 
       In view of the allegations made by the Division of Enforcement, the Commission deems 
it necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors that public administrative proceedings 
be instituted pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Exchange Act to determine:  
 
       A.     Whether the allegations in Section II hereof are true and, in connection therewith, 
to afford the Respondent an opportunity to establish any defenses to such allegations; and  
 
       B.     Whether it is necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors to suspend 
for a period not exceeding twelve months or revoke the registration of each class of securities of 
the Respondent identified in Section II hereof registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange 
Act. 
         
                                              IV. 
 
       IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that a public hearing for the purpose of taking evidence on 
the questions set forth in Section III hereof shall be convened at a time and place to be fixed, as 
provided by Rule 200 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R. § 201.200], and before 
an Administrative Law Judge to be designated by further order as provided by Rule 110 of the 
Commission’s Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R. § 201.110].  
 
       IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Respondent shall file an Answer to the allegations 
contained in this Order Instituting Proceedings within twenty (20) days after service of this 
Order, as provided by Rule 220 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R. § 201.220].  
 
       If the Respondent fails to file the directed Answer, or fails to appear at a hearing after 
being duly notified, the Respondent may be deemed in default and the proceedings may be 
determined against the Respondent upon consideration of this Order, the allegations of which 
may be deemed to be true as provided by Rules 155(a), 220(f), 221(f), and 310 of the 
Commission’s Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), 201.220(f), 201.221(f) and 201.310].  
 
       This Order shall be served forthwith upon the Respondent personally or by certified mail.  
 
       IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Administrative Law Judge shall issue an initial 
decision no later than 120 days from the date of service of this Order, pursuant to Rule 360(a)(2) 
of the Commission’s Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R. § 201.360(a)(2)].

related proceeding will be permitted to participate or advise in the decision of this matter, except 
as witness or counsel in proceedings held pursuant to notice. Since this proceeding is not “rule 
making” within the meaning of Section 551 of the Administrative Procedure Act, it is not
