Huazhen (Special General Partnership), Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Certified Public 
Accountants, Ltd., PricewaterhouseCoopers Zhong Tian CPAs Limited (collectively the

the 45-day extension is warranted, in light of the progress made thus far and current 
prospects for potential settlement, and it is worthwhile to continue their discussions.
