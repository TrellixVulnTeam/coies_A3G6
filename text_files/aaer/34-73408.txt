      On October 20, 2014, Respondents Ernst & Young Hua Ming LLP (EYHM) , 
KPMG Huazhen (Special General Partnership) (KPMG Huazhen), Deloitte Touche 
Tohmatsu Certified Public Accountants, Ltd. (DTTC), Pricewaterhousecoopers Zhong 
Tian CPAs Limited (PwC Shanghai) (collectively the Big Four Respondents), and 
the Division of Enforcement (Division), jointly  requested a 45-day extension to the 
briefing schedules set by the Commis sion by order dated August 14, 2014.1
                                                                       The Division 
represents that Respondent BDO China Dahua CPA  Co.  Ltd. (Dahua) agrees with the 
proposed extension.  
  
      In support of their motion, the Division and the Big Four Respondents state that, 
in light of the progress made thus far and current prospects for a potential settlement, it is 
worthwhile to continue their discussions, so a 45- day extension is warranted.  Absent an 
extension, continuing these talks while briefing the appeal would present challenges, 
given the breadth, complexity, and sensitivity of the issues involved.

       Extensions of time are disfavored.  It appears appropriate, however, to grant the 
requested extension.  Therefore,  
 
       It is ORDERED that the briefing schedule is extended  as follows: 
 
       December 18, 2014:  Big Four Respondents    consolidated opening brief; the 
       Divisions opening brief (as to remedies imposed on Dahua). 
        
       February 10, 2015:  Divisions principal brief and response to Big Four 
       Respondents opening brief; Dahuas response bri ef to the Divisions opening 
       brief (as to remedies imposed by Dahua). 
        
       March 3, 2015:  Big Four Respondents single consolidated response and reply 
       brief. 
        
       March 20, 2015:  Divisions reply brief (as to the Divisions Petition for review). 
        
       For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.
