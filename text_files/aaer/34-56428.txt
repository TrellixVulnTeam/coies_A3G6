ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING 
File No. 3-12789 

IN THE MATTER OF CARL S. SANKO, CPA 

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced the 
issuance of an Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Section 4C of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice 
(Order) against Carl S. Sanko, CPA (Sanko). 

The Order alleges that Sanko prepared and issued an audit report on the financial 
statements of a public company in 2004, without first registering with the Public 
Company Accounting Oversight Board (Board).  Section 102(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley Act) prohibits accounting firms not registered with the 
Board from preparing or issuing audit reports with respect to any issuer after October 22, 
2003.  The Order alleges that, by this conduct, Sanko lacked the requisite qualifications to 
represent others and that Sanko willfully violated Section 102(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. 

Based on the above, the Order institutes proceedings against Sanko pursuant to Sections 
4C(a)(1) and 4C(a)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 102(e)(1)(i) and 
102(e)(1)(iii) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice to determine whether the allegations in 
the Order are true, and whether it should be censured or temporarily or permanently denied 
the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant.   

A hearing will be scheduled before an administrative law judge to determine whether the 
allegations in the Order are true, to provide Sanko an opportunity to dispute these 
allegations, and to determine what sanctions, if any, are appropriate.  The Order directs the 
Administrative Law Judge to issue an initial decision in this matter no later than 300 days 
from the date of service of the Order.
