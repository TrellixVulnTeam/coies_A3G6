                                             FACTS 

       On the basis of this Order and the Respondents Offer, the Commission finds   1
                                                                                       that: 

                                           Summary 

       1.      From approximately <date.>September 1995</> to <date.>November 2004</>, <comp.>Total</> and others  paid 
approximately $60 million in unlawful payments to intermediaries for the   purpose of inducing  an 
Iranian government official (the Iranian Official) to use his influence to assist Total in 
connection with obtaining contracts to develop the Sirri A and E oil fields and two phases of the 
South Pars oil and gas field in Iran.  Between 1995 and 2004 the Iranian Official was first the 
head of one wholly owned subsidiary of the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) and later 
the head of another NIOC wholly owned subsidiary.  The Iranian Official was also a government 
advisor to a high-ranking Iranian official.  Total made these payments at the direction of the 
Iranian Official to intermediaries through a consulting and services agreement  and subsequent 
amendments, entered into with an intermediary designated by the   Iranian Official (Intermediary 
One). 

       2.      During the relevant time period, Total and others violated the  anti -bribery 
provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by making <item.>payments</> at the direction of the  
Iranian Official in connection with obtaining contracts.  In addition, Total lacked sufficient 
internal controls and , by mischaracterizing the payments as legitimate consulting fees, Total 
violated the books and records provisions of the federal securities laws. 

                                          Respondent 

       3.      Total is a public company organized under the laws of the Republic of France and 
headquartered in Nanterre, France.  Total explores for and develops oil and gas resources around 
the globe, and has American Depositary Shares that trade under the symbol TOT on the New 
York Stock Exchange and are registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act (15 
U.S.C. § 781(g)).  Total is required to file reports with the Commission under Section 13 of the 
Exchange Act, and is an issuer within the meaning of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
(FCPA), 15 U.S.C. § 78dd-1. 

                                    The Unlawful   Payments 

A.     Sirri A and E 

       4.      Total is an international oil and gas company involved primarily in the 
exploration for, development, production, and sale of oil and natural gas from around the world.  
Beginning in 1995, Total negotiated a development contract with NIOC     to allow Total to  
develop the Sirri A and E oil and gas fields.

       The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondents Offer of Settlement and are not binding on any 
other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.    
                                                2 
 
---------------------Page 3---------------------

       5.     NIOC was an agency and instrumentality of the Government of Iran and its 
officers and employees were foreign officials, within the meaning of the FCPA, Title 15, 
United States Code, Section 78dd-1(f)(1)(A). 

       6.     Prior to Totals executing the development cont ract with NIOC , in late May 1995 
Total held a meeting with the Iranian Official and  agreed to enter into a  purported consulting 
agreement with an intermediary designated by  the Iranian Official.  The payments that would be 
made to an intermediary pursuant to the consulting agreement were for the purpose of inducing 
the Iranian Official to use his influence to assist in obtaining NIOCs signature to the  Sirri A and 
E development agreement.   

       7.     During the course of its unlawful scheme, Total, acting through a senior executive 
and others, corruptly made certain payments and took certain acts for the purpose of inducing the 
Iranian Official to use his influence to assist Total, including the following payments and acts 
concerning Sirri A and E. 

       8.     On July 13, 1995, Total signed a contract with NIOC granting Total development 
rights over the Sirri A and E oil fields (the Sirri A/E Development Agreement). 

       9.     On July 10, 1995, three days prior to the announcement  of the Sirri A/E 
Development Agreement, Total International Ltd. (Total International), a Bermuda-registered 
subsidiary of Total, entered into a Consulting and Services Agreement (the Umbrella 
Agreement) with Intermediary One , acting at the direction of the Iranian Official.  Total made 
all payments under the Umbrella Agreement at the direction of  the Iranian Official  to his 
designated intermediary.  The Umbrella Agreement had no specific terms for payment, or other 
consideration, but instead provided that the parties would, from time to time, enter into 
Consulting Services Requests, which the parties understood would detail the amounts of the 
unlawful payments that Total would pay at the direction of the Iranian Official.  Moreover, and 
despite the Umbrella Agreements reference to the provision of economic and marketing 
research and support services to Total by Intermediary One, Total International entered into the 
Umbrella Agreement with Intermediary One as a mechanism for Total to pay at the direction of 
the Iranian Official millions of dollars in unlawful payments to Intermediary One, for the 
purpose of inducing the Iranian Official to use his influence in connection with NIOCs entering 
into the Sirri A/E Development Agreement. 

       10.    Also on July 10, 1995, the parties entered into the first Consulting Services 
Request (the First Consulting Services Request), providing for a series of payments from Total 
to Intermediary One .  That same day, Total International made a $500,000 payment from an 
account held at a United States bank  in New Yor k City to an account at a Swiss bank.  Over the 
next two-and-a-half years, pursuant to the First Consulting Services Request, Total made an 
additional five payments to intermediaries totaling approximately $16 million from accounts in 
Switzerland to an account held at a Swiss bank, at the direction of the Iranian Official.

---------------------Page 4---------------------

B.     South Pars 

       11.    During the course of its unlawful scheme, Total and others corruptly made certain 
payments and took certain acts for the purpose of inducing the Iranian Official to use his 
influence to assist Total, including the following payments and acts concerning South Pars: 

       12.    In 1997, Total began negotiating with NIOC to develop phases 2 and 3 of the 
South Pars gas field, a joint venture with a number of other multinational oil and gas companies.  
As with the Sirri A and E transaction, Total agreed to make unlawful payments to an 
intermediary designated by the Iranian Official for the purpose of inducing the Iranian Official to 
use his influence in obtaining NIOCs approval regarding South Pars. 

       13.    On June 12, 1997, Total entered into a letter agreement (the Letter Agreement) 
with Intermediary One to amend the First Consulting Services Request to provide for an 
accelerated payment of approximately $10 million from Total.  In addition, on July 14, 1997, 
Total International entered into a second Consulting Services Request (the Second Consulting 
Services Request).  This agreement memorialized an approximately  $10 million payment in 
connection with the development of the Sirri A and E fields. 

       14.    On July 13, 1997, Total International entered into an Assignment Agreement (the 
Assignment Agreement, and together with the Umbrella Agreement, the First Consulting 
Services Request, the Letter Agreement, and the Second Consulting Services Request, the 
Consulting Agreements) with  Intermediary One  and a limited liability company established in 
the British Virgin Islands (Intermediary Two).  The Assignment agreement assigned   
Intermediary Ones interests in the other Consulting Agreements to Intermediary Two .  
Intermediary One was replaced with  Intermediary Two.  

       15.    On or about September 28, 1997, Total executed a contract with NIOC granting 
Total a 40% interest in developing phases 2 and 3 of the South Pars gas field. 

       16.    For a period of seven years, from September 1997 through November 2004, Total 
made at least 12 payments exceeding $44 million to Intermediary Two for the purpose of 
inducing the Iranian Official to use his influence in connection with Totals efforts to obtain and 
retain business related to the South Pars project. 

C.     Totals Steps to Conceal  the Payments  

       17.    From the inception of Totals relationship with the Iranian Official Total 
mischaracterized the expenses under the Consulting Agreements   as business development 
expenses when  they were, in fact, unlawful payments for the purpose of inducing the Iranian 
Official to use his influence in connection with granting rights to Total for the development of 
the Sirri A and E and South Pars fields .  Total improperly c haracterized the unlawful consulting 
agreements as legitimate consulting agreements. 

       18.    Total ceased making  payments to the Iranian Officials designated intermediary in 
approximately November 2004. 

                                               4

                                       FCPA Violations 

                             Exchange Act Section 30A Violations 

       19.     Total violated the anti-bribery provisions of the federal securities laws contained 
in the FCPA  when it arranged for the payments to the Iranian Official s designated intermediary.  
The payments were intended to, and did, induce the Iranian Official to use his influence to secure 
the award to Total of development interests in Sirri A and E and the South Pars Project that, 
combined, netted Total  approximately  $150 million in profits . 

       20.     As a result of the conduct described above, Total violated Section 30A of the 
Exchange Act, which prohibits any issuer with a class of securities registered pursuant to Section 
12 of the Exchange Act, in order to obtain or retain business, from giving, or authorizing the 
giving of, anything of value to any foreign official for purposes of influencing the official or 
inducing the official to act in violation of his or her lawful duties, or to secure any improper 
advantage; or to induce a foreign official to use his influence with a foreign government or 
foreign governmental instrumentality to influence any act or decision of such government or 
instrumentality. 

                                 Books and Records Violations 

       21.     Total failed to properly account for the illegal payments and failed to accurately 
describe the Consulting Agreements in its books and records.  Instead, Total improperly 
characterized the payments it made as legitimate payments for business development expenses, 
and improperly characterized the Consulting  Agreement s as ordinary consulting agreement  s. 

       22.     As a result of the conduct described above, Total violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of 
the Exchange Act, which requires reporting companies to make and keep books, records, and 
accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect their transactions and 
disposition of their assets. 

                                  Internal Controls Violations 

       23.     In entering into the Consulting Agreements , Total circumvented its own internal 
controls.  Total concealed the Consulting Agreements true nature and participants.  Total  had 
inadequate systems for reviewing the se documents and lacked controls sufficient to provide 
reasonable assurances that the Consulting Agreements complied with applicable U.S. securities 
laws. 

       24.     As a result of the conduct described above, Total violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) of 
the Exchange Act, which requires all reporting companies to devise and maintain a system of 
internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that transactions are 
recorded in accordance with managements general or specific authorization; transactions are 
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles or any other criteria applicable to such statements, and to 
maintain accountability for assets; access to assets is permitted only in accordance with 
managements general or specific authorization; and the recorded accountability for assets is 

                                                5

compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with 
respect to any differences. 

                                              IV. 
                                                 
                                      UNDERTAKINGS 

       Respondent undertakes to: 

       1.     To engage an independent compliance consultant    that is a French national or 
French law or accounting firm (the Compliance Consultant) with demonstrated ability   in 
helping companies comply with the FCPA    , 15 U.S.C. §§ 78dd-1, et seq.   and not unacceptable to 
the staff of the Commission within 60 calendar days of the issuance of this Order.  The 
Compliance Consultant will, for a period of three years from the date of its engagement (the 
Term of the Engagem  ent), evaluate, in the manner set forth in this Order (unless any specific 
provision therein is expressly determined by any French Authority identified by the Commission 
(the French Authority) to violate French law), the effectiveness of Totals internal controls, 
record-keeping, and financial reporting policies and procedures as they relate to Totals current 
and ongoing compliance with the books and records, internal accounting controls and anti-
bribery provisions of the FCPA, codified in Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the 
Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78dd-1, 78m(b)(2)(A), and 78m(b)(2)(B)], Rule 13b2-1 thereunder 
[17 C.F.R. § 240.13b2-1], and other applicable counterparts (collectively, the anti-corruption 
laws) and take such reasonable steps as, in its view, may be necessary to fulfill the foregoing 
mandate (the Mandate). 

       2.     The Mandate shall include an assessment of Totals   Board of Directors and 
senior managements commitment to an effective implementation of a corporate compliance 
program against violations of the anti-corruption laws and its compliance code.  

       3.     Total shall cooperate fully with the Compliance Consultant  and the Compliance 
Consultant shall have the authority to take such reasonable steps as, in its views, may be 
necessary to be fully informed about Totals compliance program within the scope of the 
Mandate, in accordance with the principles set forth herein and applicable law, including 
applicable data protections and labor laws and regulations, such as, among others, Article 1 of 
French Law No. 68-768 of July 26, 1968, as amended by Law No. 80-538 of July 16, 1980 (the 
Blocking Statute).  To that end, Total shall:  (1) facilitate the Compliance Consultants access 
to Totals documents and other information and resources, (2) not limit such access, except as 
provided in this paragraph, and (3) provide guidance on applicable local law (such as relevant 
data protection and labor laws) to allow the Compliance Consultant to fulfill its Mandate.  Total 
shall provide the Compliance Consultant with access to all information, documents, records, 
facilities, and/or employees, as reasonably requested by the Compliance Consultant, that fall 
within the scope of the Mandate of the Compliance Consultant  . 

       4.     The Commission and Total agree that the retention of the Compliance Consultant    
does not establish an attorney-client, auditor-client, or similar relationship between Total and the 
Compliance Consultant which would otherwise prevent the Compliance Consultant      from 
fulfilling its Mandate in accordance with this Order. 

                                               6 
 
---------------------Page 7---------------------

       5.      In the event that Total seeks to withhold from the Compliance Consultant  access 
to information, documents, records, facilities, and/or employees of Total that may be subject to a 
claim of attorney-client privilege, the attorney work-product doctrine, or similar legal 
relationships, or where Total reasonably believes production would otherwise be inconsistent 
with applicable law, Total shall work cooperatively with the Compliance Consultant   to resol ve 
the matter to the satisfaction of the Compliance Consultant.  If the matter cannot be resolved, at 
the request of the Compliance Consultant , Total shall promptly provide written notice to the 
Compliance Consultant and to the   French Authority.  Such noti ce shall include a general 
description of the nature of the information, documents, records, facilities, and/or employees that 
are being withheld, as well as the basis for the claim.  The French Authority may then transmit 
this written notice in accordance with French law to the Commission.  The Commission staff 
may then consider whether to make a further request for access to such information, documents, 
records, facilities, and/or employees, to be provided by Total to the French Authority.  To the 
extent Total has provided information to the Commission staff in the course of the investigation 
leading to this action pursuant to a non-waiver of privilege agreement, Total and the Compliance 
Consultant may agree to production of such information to the Complia  nce Consultant pursuant 
to a similar non-waiver agreement. 

       6.      Except as provided in paragraphs 4 and 5 herein , Total shall not withhold from 
the Compliance Consultant   any information, documents, records, facilities, and/or employees on 
the basis of an attorney-client privilege, work-product claim, or other similar legal relationship. 

       7.      To carry out the Mandate, during the Term of the Engagement, Total shall require 
the Compliance Consultant   to conduct a yearly review and prepare a yearly report for three 
years, for a total of three reviews and three reports.  The yearly reports will likely include 
proprietary, financial, confidential, and competitive business information.  Moreover, public 
disclosure of the reports could discourage cooperation or impede pending or potential 
government investigations.  For these reasons, among others, the yearly reports and the contents 
thereof are intended to remain and shall remain non-public, except as otherwise agreed to by the 
parties in writing, or except to the extent that the Commission determines in its sole discretion 
that disclosure would be in furtherance of the Commissions discharge of its duties and 
responsibilities or is otherwise required by law.   

       8.      With respect to each yearly review, after consultation with Total, Total shall 
require the Compliance Consultant  to prepare a written work plan that shall be submitted no 
fewer than 60 calendar days prior to commencing   each review to Total and to the Commission 
unless, in the Compliance Consultant s view, transmittal of such work plan would violate 
applicable laws, in which case it shall be transmitted to Total and the French Authority.  In such 
case, the French Authority may then transmit such information in accordance with French law to 
the Commission.  Total and the Commission shall have no more than 30 calendar days after 
receipt of the written work plan to provide comment to the Compliance Consultant   about the 
work plan.  The Compliance Consultant   s work plan for the initial review shall include such 
steps as are reasonably necessary to conduct an effective initial review in accordance with the 
Mandate, including developing an understanding, to the extent the Compliance Consultant    deems 
appropriate, of the facts and circumstances surrounding any violations that may have occurred 
before the entry of the Order, but in developing such understanding the Compliance Consultant   
is to rely to the extent possible on available information and documents provided by Total.  It is 

                                                7 
 
---------------------Page 8---------------------

not intended that the Compliance Consultant  will conduct its own inquiry into those historical 
events.  In developing each work plan and in carrying out the reviews pursuant to such plans, the 
Compliance Consultant is encouraged to coordinate with Total personnel, including auditors and 
compliance personnel.  To the extent the Compliance Consultant  deems appropriate, it may rely 
on Totals processes, on the results of studies, reviews, audits, and analyses conducted by or on 
behalf of Total, and on sampling and testing methodologies.  The Compliance Consultant   is not 
expected to conduct a comprehensive review of all business lines, all business activities, or all 
markets.  Any disputes between Total and the Complianc  e Consultant with respect to the work 
plan shall be decided by the Commission staff in its sole discretion.  The Compliance Consultant 
will send each report to the French Authority, which may forward such information in 
accordance with French law to the Commission. 

       9.     The initial review shall commence no later than 120 calendar days from the date 
of the engagement of the Compliance Consultant (unless otherwise agreed by Total, the 
Compliance Consultant, and the Commission staff), and Total shall require the Co mpliance 
Consultant to issue a written report within 120 calendar days of initiating the initial review, 
setting forth the Compliance Consultants assessment and making recommendations reasonably 
designed to improve the effectiveness of Totals program for ensuring compliance with the anti-
corruption laws.  The Compliance Consultant  is encouraged to consult with Total concerning its 
findings and recommendations on an ongoing basis, and to consider and reflect Totals 
comments and input to the extent the Com pliance Consultant deems appropriate.  The 
Compliance Consultant need not in its initial or subsequent reports recite or describe 
comprehensively Totals history or compliance policies, procedures, and practices, but rather 
may focus on those areas with respect to which the Compliance Consultant   wishes to make 
recommendations for improvement or which the Compliance Consultant otherwise concludes 
merit particular attention, if any.  Total shall require the Compliance Consultant to provide the 
report to the Managing Board of Total and contemporaneously transmit copies to the French 
Authority.  The French Authority may then transmit such information in accordance with French 
law to the Commission.  After consultation with Total, the Compliance Consultant  may ex tend 
the time period for issuance of the report for up to 60 calendar days with prior written approval 
of the Commission staff. 

       10.    Within 120 calendar days after receiving the Compliance Consultant  s report, 
Total shall adopt all recommendations in the report unless within 60 calendar days after 
receiving the report, Total notifies the Compliance Consultant and the Commission staff in 
writing of any recommendations Total considers unduly burdensome, inconsistent with local or 
other applicable law or regulation, impractical, unduly expensive, or otherwise inadvisable.  It 
shall not be deemed unduly burdensome if information otherwise protected by the Blocking 
Statute, may be provided to the Commission in accordance with French law via the French 
Authority or in some other manner.  With respect to any recommendation Total considers unduly 
burdensome, inconsistent with local or other applicable law or regulation, impractical, unduly 
expensive, or otherwise inadvisable, Total need not adopt that recommendation within 120 
calendar days after receiving the Compliance Consultants report, but shall propose in writing to 
the Compliance Consultant  an alternative policy, procedure, or system designed to achieve the 
same objective or purpose.  As to any recommendation on which Total and the Compliance 
Consultant do not agree, the parties shall attempt in good faith to reach an agreement within 45 
calendar days after Total serves written notice.  In the event Total and the Compliance 

                                               8

Consultant are unable to agree on an acceptable alternative proposal, Total shall promptly 
consult with the Commission staff, which will make a determination as to whether Total should 
adopt the Compliance Consultant  s recommendation or an alternative proposal, and Total shall 
abide by that determination.  During the time period in which a Commission determination is 
pending, Total shall not be required to implement any contested recommendation.  With respect 
to any recommendation the Compliance Consultant     determines cannot reasonably be 
implemented within 120 calendar days after receiving the report, the Compliance Consultant   
may extend the time period for implementation with prior written approval of the Commission 
staff. 

       11.    Total shall require the Compliance Consultant   to undertake two follow -up reviews 
to carry out the Mandate.  Within 120 calendar days of initiating each follow-up review, Total 
shall require the Compliance Consultant  to: (a) complete the review; (b) certify whether the 
compliance program of Total, including its policies and procedures, is reasonably designed and 
implemented to detect and prevent violations within Total of the anti-corruption laws; and (c) 
report on the Compliance Consultants findings in the same fashion as set forth in Paragraph 8 
with respect to the initial review.  The second review shall commence one year after the initial 
review commenced.  The third review shall commence two years after the first review 
commenced.  After consultation with Total, the Compliance Consultant    may extend the time 
period for these follow-up reviews for up to 60 calendar days with prior written approval of the 
Commission staff. 

       12.    In undertaking the assessments and reviews in Paragraphs 7 and 11,   Total shall 
require the Compliance Consultant  to formulate conclusions based on, among other things:  (a) 
inspection of relevant documents, including Totals current anti-corruption policies and 
procedures; (b) on-site observation of selected systems and procedures of Total at sample sites, 
including internal controls and record-keeping and internal audit procedures; (c) meetings with 
and interviews of relevant employees, officers, directors, and other persons at mutually 
convenient times and places; and (d) analyses, studies, and testing of Totals compliance 
program with respect to anti-corruption laws. 

       13.    Should the Compliance Consultant   , during the course of its engagement, discover 
that questionable or corrupt payments or questionable or corrupt transfers of property or interests 
may have been offered, promised, paid, or authorized by any entity or person within Total, or 
any entity or person working directly or indirectly for Total, or that related false books and 
records may have been maintained relating to Total either (a) after the date of this Order or (b) 
that have not been adequately dealt with by Total (collectively improper activities), Total shall 
require the Compliance Consultant  to promptly report such improper activities to Totals General 
Counsel or Audit Committee for further action.  If the Compliance Consultant  believes that any 
improper activity or activities may constitute a significant violation of law, Total shall require 
the Compliance Consultant   also  to report such improper activity in writing to the French 
Authority.  The French Authority may then transmit such information in accordance with French 
law to the Commission.  Total shall require the Compliance Consultant  to disclose improper 
activities in its discretion directly to the French Authority, and not to the General Counsel or 
Audit Committee, if the Compliance Consultant   believes that disclosure to the General Counsel 
or Audit Committee would be inappropriate under the circumstances.  Total shall require the 
Compliance Consultant to address in its reports the appropriateness of Totals response to all 

                                               9

improper activities.  Further, in the event that Total or any entity or person working directly or 
indirectly within Total refuses to provide information necessary for the Compliance Consultant  
to perform its duties, if the Compliance Consultant believes that such refusal is without just 
cause, Total shall require the Compliance Consultant  to disclose that fact in writing to the French 
Authority, with appropriate notice to the Commission.  Total shall not take any action to retaliate 
against the Compliance Consultant   for any such disclosures.  The Compliance Consultant  may 
report to the French Authority any criminal or regulatory violations by Total or any other entity 
or person discovered in the course of performing its duties.  The French Authority may then 
transmit such information in accordance with French law to the Commission. 

       14.     Total shall require the Compliance Consultant  to enter into an agreement with 
Total that provides that for the Term of the Compliance Consultancy   and for a period of two 
years from completion of the engagement  , the Compliance Consultant   shall not enter into any 
employment, consultant, attorney-client, auditing or other professional relationship with Total, or 
any of its present or former affiliates, directors, officers, employees, or agents acting in their 
capacity.  The agreement will also provide that the Compliance  Consultant  will require that any 
firm with which it is affiliated or of which it is a member shall not, without prior written consent 
of the Commission staff, enter into any employment, consultant, attorney-client, auditing, or 
other professional relationship with Total or any of its present or former affiliates, directors, 
officers, employees, or agents acting in their capacity as such, and any person engaged to assist 
the Compliance Consultant in the performance of its duties under this Order for the Term of the 
Engagement and for a period of two  years thereafter.  To ensure the independence of the 
Compliance Consultant, Total shall not have the authority to terminate the Compliance 
Consultant during the Term of the Engagement    without the prior written ap proval of the 
Commission staff.  

       15.     At least annually, and more frequently if appropriate, representatives from Total 
and the Commission staff will meet to discuss the consultancy  and any suggestions, comments, 
or improvements Total may wish to discuss with or   propose to the Commission staff. 

       16.     Total will use its best efforts to ensure that any information that might be 
protected by the Blocking Statute or by other laws that becomes the subject of the Compliance 
Consultants reviews or reports is provided to the Commission in accordance with French law 
via the French Authority or in some other appropriate manner.

form of a narrative, and be supported by exhibits sufficient to demonstrate compliance.  The
