Appeal filed:  October 21, 2011 
Last brief received:  January 26, 2012 
                                                I. 
       Michael C. Pattison, a certified public accountant ("CPA") and former Controller of 
<comp.>Embarcadero Technologies, Inc.</> ("Embarcadero") from January 2000 through July 2005, appeals 
from an initial decision of an administrative law judge.1 
                                                          The law judge decided this matter based 
on cross-motions for summary disposition, granting the Division's motion and denying Pattison's 
motion.  The law judge found that Pattison was enjoined from violating internal accounting 
controls and books and records provisions of the federal securities laws and permanently denied 
him the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3) of 
the Commission's Rules of Practice. 2 
                                       We base our findings on an independent review of the 
record, except with respect to those findings not challenged on appeal.

A.     District Court Injunctive Proceeding 

       On September 24, 2010, following a civil trial in the United States District Court for the 
Northern District of California, a jury found that Pattison violated Section 13(b)(5) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934  and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1  in connection with Pattison's34
involvement in backdating stock options. 5 
                                            On June 9, 2011, the District Court issued a corrected 
order finding that the jury's verdict was "supported by substantial evidence in the record," and

               Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) provides that "[n]o person shall knowingly 
circumvent or knowingly fail to implement a system of internal accounting controls or knowingly 
falsify any book, record, or account described in paragraph (2)."  15 U.S.C. § 78m(b)(5).  Section 
13(b)(2)(A) and (B), respectively, require that every issuer subject to the statute make and keep 
books, records, and accounts which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the issuer's assets, and devise and maintain a system of internal 
accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that transactions and assets are 
handled as prescribed in the statute.  15 U.S.C. §§ 78m(b)(2)(A) and (B).  
       4 
               Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 provides that "[n]o person shall directly or indirectly, 
falsify or cause to be falsified, any book, record or account" subject to Section 13(b)(2)(A).  
17 C.F.R. § 240.13b2-1.  See also supra note 3. 
       5 
               The jury did not find Pattison liable on claims that he had violated or aided and 
abetted violations of antifraud provisions or aided and abetted violations of reporting provisions 
of the federal securities laws.

                                                                            On that same date, 
the District Court entered a separate corrected final judgment against Pattison, permanently 
enjoining him from violating Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1.    7 
                                                                                              
The District Court ordered Pattison to disgorge $74,446 and pay a civil money penalty of 
$50,000.  Pattison has appealed the District Court's final judgment to the United States Court of 
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.8 
                                That appeal is pending.  The District Court's findings are 
summarized below. 

       1.     Embarcadero and its Employee Stock Option Policy 

       Embarcadero is a software company headquartered in San Francisco, California.  In 
April 2000, Embarcadero held an initial public offering and remained a publicly-traded company 
through June 2007.  From <date.>late 2000</> until the <date.>third quarter of 2004</>, Embarcadero's chief 
executive officer ("CEO"), Stephen Wong, granted <item.>stock options</> to employees pursuant to 
authorization from the company's Compensation Committee.  

       A stock option "is the right to purchase a share of stock from a company at a fixed price, 
referred to as the 'strike price,' on or after a specified vesting date."9 
                                                                    A recipient who exercises 
the option by purchasing stock from the company at the strike price is then free to sell the same 
stock at its current market price.10 
                                   Companies generally grant stock options with a strike price

Officer during the period at issue and consented to an injunction from violating or aiding and 
abetting the violation of various reporting, recordkeeping, internal controls, and antifraud 
provisions of the federal securities laws, a $200,000 civil money penalty, and a $300,000 
forfeiture under Section 304(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 15 U.S.C. § 7243(a).  SEC v.

equal to the market price on the date the stock option is granted.11 
                                                                   "Backdating" stock options 
refers to "the practice of recording an option's grant date and strike price retrospectively."12 
                                                                                           
Where the backdating results in a strike price that is lower than the fair market value of the stock 
on the date of the actual grant, the option is referred to as "in the money" because it has 
immediate positive value on that date.13 
                                        

       Pattison, who had been a practicing accountant since 1987, was the only licensed CPA in 
Embarcadero's Finance Department and served as the company's Controller from January 2000 
through July 2005.  As Controller, Pattison oversaw Embarcadero's day-to-day accounting 
functions and was responsible for communicating with auditors and preparing financial 
statements that were filed with the Commission. 14 
                                                   During that time, he was also responsible for 
"recording all equity account activity," including activity related to the issuance of stock options 
to employees. 
  
       Embarcadero's stock option plan, which was approved by the Board of Directors and 
stockholders in February 2000, governed the manner in which the company issued and accounted 
for stock options.  In that plan, Embarcadero adopted an accounting convention promulgated in 
1972 referred to as the Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 ("APB 25").  Under APB 
25, a company granting an in-the-money stock option is required "to record an expense for the 
'profit,' treated as compensation to the option recipient over the [option's] vesting period."15 
                                                                                             In 
other words, the benefit to the option recipient is recorded on the company's corporate books and

               Id.; see also New Mexico State Inv. Council v. Ernst & Young LLP, 641 F.3d 
1089, 1093 (9th Cir. 2011) ("Backdating of options occurs when a company's officers or 
directors responsible for administering the [company's] stock option plan monitor the price of the 
company stock and then award a stock option grant as of a certain date in the past when the share 
price was lowest, thus locking in the largest possible gain for the option recipient."). 
       13 
               See SEC v. Berry, 580 F. Supp. 2d 911, 913 n.2 (N.D. Cal. 2008).  If a stock 
option is issued at a strike price equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date of the 
actual grant, then the option is "at the money," whether or not backdating has occurred.  See SEC 
v. Reyes , 491 F. Supp. 2d 906, 908 (N.D. Cal. 2007). 
       14 
               Because the company's stock was registered with the Commission pursuant to 
Exchange Act Section 12(g) and traded on Nasdaq, Exchange Act Section 13 required 
Embarcadero to file with the Commission annual reports (Form 10-K) that included audited 
financial statements and quarterly reports (Form 10-Q).  15 U.S.C. § 78m. 
       15 
               New Mexico State Inv. Council, 641 F.3d at 1093, 1096.

in the company's financial statements as a non-cash compensation expense. 16 
                                                                              Otherwise, "the 
company's reported net income is overstated for each of the years the options vest, potentially 
deceiving the market and investors."17 
                                       Pattison knew that under APB 25 "in-the-money" options 
had to be reported as a compensation expense. 

       Although Embarcadero adopted a method of accounting for in-the-money stock options, 
Pattison knew that the company nevertheless understood that it had not and would not grant that 
type of stock option.  For example, Embarcadero's legal counsel told Pattison that the company 
would not backdate stock options.  Pattison drafted and distributed a July 1, 2002 internal 
controls memorandum explaining that "since the IPO[,] no option has ever been issued at below 
fair market value.  Therefore, there have been no additional deferred comp charges.  The 
Company does not intend to issue below fair market value options in the future."  Pattison 
authored another internal controls memorandum, dated March 14, 2003, in which he stated that 
there would be no stock option grants below fair market value.  Pattison also knew that, 
consistent with the memoranda and the advice provided by Embarcadero's legal counsel, 
Embarcadero publicly stated that it had not granted in-the-money stock options.  For example, 
Embarcadero stated in Forms 10-K covering fiscal years 2003 and 2002 that it adopted APB 25, 
and that "[s]ince the date of the initial public offering, all stock options grants made during the 
year were at fair market value, which is defined as the closing share price on the day prior to the 
option grant date."   

       2.     Pattison Did Not Properly Record Backdated Stock Option Grants 

       From late 2000 through 2004, Wong nonetheless granted in-the-money stock options, and 
Pattison did not properly record these transactions.  Near the end of each quarter, Pattison 
compiled and sent to Wong a proposed list of employees who were to receive in-the-money stock 
options.  These stock options were backdated, i.e., the date of the strike price on the stock option 
was earlier than the date that Wong approved the grant.18 
                                                          After receiving approval from Wong, 
Pattison sent the information to E*Trade, which maintained Embarcadero's stock options data, 
where he entered the backdated information instead of the date on which Wong approved the 
grant.  E*Trade then entered the backdated information provided by Pattison into a database used 
to track Embarcadero's stock option grants.  At Pattison's direction, an administrative assistant 
prepared stock option agreements for Embarcadero's employees.  The assistant relied on the 
backdated information in the E*Trade database to prepare the agreement.

       Embarcadero's auditors reviewed the company's stock option activity each quarter.  In 
connection with that review, Pattison provided the auditors with quarterly summaries of stock 
option activity.  Although it was important to the auditors to know whether stock options were 
backdated in connection with their review of the company's financial statements and disclosures, 
neither the quarterly summaries that Pattison prepared for them nor Pattison himself informed the 
auditors that stock options were backdated.  

        At Wong's instruction, Pattison also "parked" stock options, i.e., reserved stock options 
for later use by purportedly having assigned them to an employee.  For example, in April 2002, 
Pattison represented through the E*Trade template and in a quarterly summary provided to the 
auditors that a purported employee named Kent Scantland received 75,000 stock options. 
Pattison knew, however, that Scantland was no longer an employee and that the stock options 
were not intended for him.  When Pattison asked Wong what to do about "the 75K place marker 
to Kent Scantland" and informed him that the auditors "tend[ed] to spend a fair deal of time on 
the options," Wong replied, "If you can wipe it, then we should do so since it is out of the 
money."  After the auditors tested the Scantland grant as part of their review, they recorded in 
their workpapers Pattison's explanation that the Scantland grant had been an error and recorded 
in the wrong place under the wrong name.  Pattison did not tell the auditors that Wong instructed 
him to "sock away" stock options or to "wipe" the Scantland grant. 

       Pattison parked stock options on a second occasion.  In May 2004, Embarcadero's Vice 
President of Human Resources asked to speak with Pattison about an allegation that he "put some 
options in an employee's account for another employee."  Pattison admitted that he did so, to 
which the vice president responded that, "It is just wrong on so many levels."   

       In 2006, Embarcadero's Audit Committee retained a law firm to conduct an internal 
investigation after receiving a report from the company's auditors about past stock option grants. 
Embarcadero's Board of Directors formed a "Special Committee" to analyze the company's past 
stock options practices, "including all option grants from the Company's initial public offering in 
April 2000 to August 2006 . . . ."  The Special Committee concluded that "about half" of the 
"1,086 individual stock option grants on 119 different dates, representing more than 6.5 million 
shares of common stock" "were misdated and mispriced from the time of the initial public 
offering until March 2005."  On December 18, 2006, Embarcadero issued a press release 
announcing the Audit Committee's conclusion that all of the company's previously issued 
financial statements should not be relied upon.  Embarcadero thereafter filed a restatement of 
certain portions of its financial statements variously covering fiscal years 2006 through 2002. 
The restatement explained that as a result of the revised accounting for the options in question, 
Embarcadero's stock-based compensation expense figures from the time of the initial public 
offering in April 2000 through December 31, 2005 had been understated by a total of $14.6 
million.

       3.      District Court Judgment 

       The District Court found that 

       [t]he weight of the evidence established that [Pattison] systematically backdated 
       stock option grants on a regular basis, misrepresented the dates of actual 
       approval by CEO Wong, failed to affirmatively disclose the practice to the Board 
       and . . . auditors, and failed to insure that an accounting expense was taken for 
       the . . . 'in-the-money' grants he facilitated.  The weight of the evidence also 
       shows that he thereby circumvented internal controls against backdated options. 

The District Court concluded that the "jury found that [Pattison] acted knowingly when he 
falsified records and/or circumvented internal controls to make it appear that no stock option 
grants were backdated and below fair market value."  The District Court enjoined Pattison from 
violating Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, and ordered him to 
disgorge $74,446 and pay a civil money penalty of $50,000. 

B.     Administrative Proceedings 
        
       On April 5, 2011, based on the injunction, we issued an Order Instituting Proceedings 
pursuant to Rule of Practice 102(e)(3)(i) and temporarily suspended Pattison from appearing or 
practicing before the Commission. 19 
                                      Pattison filed a timely petition to lift the temporary 
suspension, which the Division of Enforcement opposed.   20 
                                                            We denied Pattison's petition and 
directed that a hearing be held before a law judge.21 
                                                     After a prehearing conference, Pattison and 
the Division each moved for summary disposition pursuant to Rule 250 of the Commission's 
Rules of Practice.22 
                     On September 29, 2011, an administrative law judge found there was no 
genuine issue with regard to any material fact and granted the Division's motion pursuant to Rule 
250.  The law judge found that the District Court "permanently enjoined Pattison from violating 
federal securities laws, by reason of his misconduct, in an action brought by the Commission." 
In determining the appropriate sanction, the law judge found it "in the public interest to 
permanently disqualify Pattison from appearing or practicing before the Commission."  This 
appeal followed.

                                               III. 

       Rule of Practice 102(e) has been the primary tool available to the Commission to preserve 
the integrity of its processes and ensure the competence of the professionals who appear and 
practice before it.23 
                     The Commission adopted the rule as a "means to ensure that those

enables the Commission to initiate administrative disciplinary proceedings against professionals 
who do not possess the requisite qualifications to represent others, lack character or integrity, 
engage in unethical or improper professional conduct, have violated or have been enjoined from 
violating or aiding and abetting the violation of the federal securities laws, have had their license 
to practice revoked or suspended, or have been convicted of a felony or misdemeanor involving 
moral turpitude.25 
                   The sanctions available in such proceedings include a censure, temporary 
suspension, and permanent disqualification from practice before the Commission.   26 

       In a proceeding under Rule 102(e)(3), the Division has the burden to show that the 
petitioner has been permanently enjoined by a court of competent jurisdiction, by reason of his 
misconduct in an action brought by the Commission, from violating or aiding and abetting the 
violation of the federal securities laws, or has been found by a court of competent jurisdiction in 
an action brought by the Commission, or by the Commission in an administrative proceeding, to

have violated or aided and abetted the violation of the federal securities laws.27 
                                                                                 Once that burden 
has been met, the burden shifts to the petitioner to show cause why he should not be censured or 
temporarily or permanently disqualified from appearing and practicing before the Commission.   28 
                                                                                                  
A petitioner in a Rule 102(e)(3) proceeding may not collaterally attack any finding made against 
him or fact admitted by him the in the underlying proceeding.29 

       Here, the Division satisfied its burden by showing that the District Court, a court of 
competent jurisdiction, in an action brought by the Commission, found Pattison in violation of 
internal accounting controls and books and records provisions of the federal securities laws and, 
based on its findings, permanently enjoined him from violating those provisions.  The sole issues 
therefore are whether Pattison has shown cause why he should not be sanctioned, and if he has 
not, to determine the appropriate remedial sanction. 

       Pattison, however, challenges the Division's right to bring this proceeding under Rule 
102(e)(3).  He argues that "the Commission should be required to base any administrative 
discipline, including a permanent suspension, under a subsection of Rule 102(e)(1)" because "any 
other ruling leaves open the chance of administrative sanctions with no standard."  Pattison 
points to Rule 102(e)(1)(ii), which permits the Commission to discipline an accountant for 
"improper professional conduct," and to Rule 102(e)(1)(iv), which defines that term, with respect 
to persons licensed to practice as accountants, to mean: 

       (A) intentional or knowing conduct, including reckless conduct, that results in a 
       violation of applicable professional standards; or 

       (B) either of the following two types of negligent conduct:  

               (1) a single instance of highly unreasonable conduct that results in a 
       violation of applicable professional standards in circumstances in which an 
       accountant knows, or should know, that heightened scrutiny is warranted.

               (2) repeated instances of unreasonable conduct, each resulting in a 
       violation of applicable professional standards, that indicate a lack of competence 
       to practice before the Commission.  30 
                                              

From this, he concludes that "the conduct for which an accountant is disciplined must be done 
with a certain level of mens rea." 

       Pattison argues that proceeding under Rule 102(e)(3), as the Division did here, would 
allow the Division to "seek discipline after  any permanent injunction, regardless of the level of 
scienter involved in the underlying claim, or the type of claim" (emphasis in original).  He 
characterizes as "immaterial" the citations by the Division and law judge to analogous 
settlements under Rule 102(e)(3) because those matters were "not prosecuted through the 
administrative tribunal."  Pattison states that he was entitled to summary disposition because the 
Division failed to "provide notice of its basis for discipline" or "adequately allege liability" under 
Rule 102(e)(1). 
 
       Pattison's argument fails to recognize the distinct bases for disciplinary action provided 
under subsections (3) and (1) of Rule 102(e).  The Commission may, pursuant to Rule 
102(e)(3)(i)(A), suspend or bar a respondent based on an injunction.  This does not create a 
"chance of administrative sanctions with no standard."  To the contrary, the Rule has a structured, 
precise standard:  Once the respondent has requested a hearing, the Division must establish that 
the respondent has been "permanently enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction, by reason 
of his or her misconduct in an action brought by the Commission, from violating or aiding and 
abetting the violation of any provision of the federal securities laws or of the rules and 
regulations thereunder" as the basis for the proceeding.  Rule 102(e)(3) thus reflects our 
determination that a finding by a court of competent jurisdiction that a respondent has violated 
securities laws, or that an injunction against future violations is warranted, is a sufficient standard 
of unfitness for practice before the Commission that we "will afford a hearing only to consider 
mitigating or other factors why neither censure nor temporary or permanent disqualification 
should be imposed." 31 
                        "The overall purpose of the . . . amendment [that added paragraph (3) to 
Rule 102(e)] is to prevent situations in which the investing public places its trust in, or reliance 
upon, attorneys, accountants, engineers, and other professionals or experts who have

the Commission to "restrict practice before the Commission by persons found to have violated or 
to have participated in violations of the securities laws and by persons who have been 
permanently enjoined from violating the securities laws, whether or not a finding of past 
violation has been made").  Furthermore, "no distinction will be made between injunctions and 
findings which have been contested and those which have been entered upon consent."   Id.

securities laws . . . ."32 
                        

       Rule 102(e)(3) then permits the respondent to show cause why he or she should not be 
censured or temporarily or permanently disqualified from appearing and practicing before the 
Commission.  Under this provision, the Commission acts "with due regard to the public 
interest."33 
            The standards by which we are guided in assessing the public interest are those set 
forth in Steadman v. SEC 34
                            in determining the appropriate remedial sanction under Rule 
102(e)(3).35 
             As noted, we also consider any mitigative factors established by the respondent. 

       Rule 102(e)(3)(i)(A) is analogous to our statutory authority under Exchange Act Section 
15(b)(6)(A)(iii) to discipline a regulated person who is enjoined from any action, conduct, or 
practice specified in Exchange Act Section 15(b)(4)(C). 36 
                                                           Matters brought pursuant to this 
provision require only that the Division establish that the respondent is a person associated or 
seeking to become associated, or, at the time of the alleged misconduct, was associated or was 
seeking to become associated with a broker or dealer, or is a person participating, or at the time 
of the alleged misconduct, was participating in a penny stock offering, and that the person "is 

       32 
               Id.  Pattison incorrectly states that Rule 102(e)(3) permits the Division to "seek 
discipline after  any permanent injunction, regardless of the level of scienter involved in the 
underlying claim, or the type of claim."  Subpart 3 is limited to injunctions based on violations of 
the federal securities laws.  Thus, the standard for the presumption of unfitness to practice before 
the Commission is directly related to the individual's failure to comply with statutes administered 
by the Commission.

the underlying injunction or court's findings may only do so by filing an appeal in the appropriate 
United States Court of Appeals. 40 
                                   

       By contrast, Rule 102(e)(1), codified by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,  41
                                                                                   authorizes the 
Commission to discipline professionals for "improper professional conduct," defined for 
accountants as conduct that the Commission finds "results in a violation of applicable 
professional standards," and meets certain mens rea requirements.  Thus, a proceeding under 
Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) does not necessarily involve conduct that is illegal, nor does it involve a 
situation where another adjudicatory tribunal has already made findings of misconduct and 
imposed a sanction.  Unlike proceedings brought under Rule 102(e)(3), the Commission itself 
must make the determination as to whether the respondent's conduct fits within certain standards 
carefully defined under Rule 102(e)(1), including, with respect to accountants, whether 
professional standards have been violated with a defined mens rea.  If such conduct falls within 
the proscriptions of Rule 102(e)(1), the Commission must then determine whether a sanction is 
appropriate.  Similarly, proceedings brought, for example, under Exchange Act Section 
15(b)(4)(A) or (D) require the Commission to make its own findings of misconduct before it can 
determine the appropriate sanction, if any.42 
                                             That is because, as with Rule 102(e)(1), the 
Commission does not have in the record findings made by another adjudicatory tribunal to serve 
as a basis for a sanction determination.  In proceedings brought under Rule 102(e)(3) based on an 
underlying injunction, however, the Commission may rely on the findings of a court that an 
injunction against future violative conduct is warranted.43

       Accordingly, we reject Pattison's contention that this matter should have been brought 
under Rule 102(e)(1) and find that the Division appropriately brought this proceeding under 
Rule 102(e)(3). 

B.     Public Interest Factors 

       In assessing the need for sanctions in the public interest, we consider, among other things: 
the egregiousness of the respondent's actions, the isolated or recurrent nature of the infraction, 
the degree of scienter involved, the sincerity of the respondent's assurances against future 
violations, the respondent's recognition of the wrongful nature of his or her conduct, and the 
likelihood that the respondent's occupation will present opportunities for future violations.44 
                                                                                              Our 
"inquiry into . . . the public interest is a flexible one, and no one factor is dispositive."45 
                                                                                         We also 
consider the extent to which the sanction will have a deterrent effect.46 

       We find that Pattison's conduct was egregious and recurrent.  For every quarterly period 
over four years, Pattison facilitated improper backdating by falsifying Embarcadero's books and 
records and circumventing Embarcadero's system of internal accounting controls.  Corporate 
books and records are "'the bedrock elements of our system of corporate disclosure and 
accountability,'" and thus "accurate recordkeeping is an essential ingredient in promoting 
management responsibility." 47 
                                Likewise, 

       [i]nternal controls safeguard assets and assure the reliability of financial records, 
       one of their main jobs being to prevent and detect errors and irregularities that 
       arise in the accounting systems of the company.  Internal accounting controls are

       basic indicators of the reliability of the financial statements and the accounting 
       system and records from which financial statements are prepared. 48 

       Pattison's actions betrayed these principles and, as the District Court found, had profound 
effects.  Embarcadero understated corporate expenses by more than $14 million.  The company 
possessed books and records and filed public reports with the Commission that failed to 
accurately and fairly reflect its transactions and disposition of its assets.  It suffered the receipt of 
decreased payments when employees exercised backdated stock options.  The Company's share 
value was potentially diluted as a result of enhanced incentives to exercise stock options.  In 
2007, Embarcadero restated portions of its financial statements going back as far as fiscal year 
2002, and faced negative tax consequences associated with the restatement.  In addition to being 
enjoined, Pattison was ordered to disgorge $74,446—representing the portion of his profit 
attributable to exercising his own backdated stock options—and pay a second-tier civil money 
penalty of $50,000, which the District Court judge determined was reflective of the jury's view 
that Pattison "knowingly engaged in conduct violative of regulatory and statutory laws."49 
                                                                                          We 
therefore reject Pattison's characterization of his misconduct as a "mere technical violation" 
arising "from a single decision made to delegate option-granting authority to the CEO in the 
fourth quarter of 2000."   

       We find that Pattison acted with a high degree of scienter.  Pattison had been a practicing 
accountant for roughly fifteen years and was the only licensed CPA in Embarcadero's Finance 
Department.  Despite knowing that APB 25 required the company to record in-the-money stock 
option grants as outgoing compensation and that the company did not intend to grant in-the­
money stock options, in part based on internal controls memoranda that Pattison authored, 
Pattison nonetheless facilitated the improper granting of in-the-money stock options.  He did so 
by entering backdated information into Embarcadero's E*Trade database, directing his 
administrative assistant to prepare stock option agreements for Embarcadero's employees based 
on the backdated information, providing to the company's auditors, without further elaboration, 
quarterly summaries that he knew contained backdated information, and parking backdated stock

                                                               The District Court determined that 
"[a] reasonable inference is that Defendant consciously intended to hide the actual grant approval 
dates from the auditors and keep backdated options from being publicly reported.  Certainly, the 
jury could have so found."51 
                              We conclude that Pattison's repeated efforts to conceal improper 
backdating further demonstrate that he acted with a high degree of scienter.52 

       Pattison asserts that the Initial Decision and the District Court improperly determined that 
he acted with scienter and argues that the jury found him liable for a violation that did not require 
a showing of scienter.  He contends that "[t]he 'knowing' standard of Section 13(b)(5) is not the 
same as 'scienter.'  A 'knowing' violation of Section 13(b)(5) means that Pattison was found to 
have acted intentionally, but not that he acted with the 'intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud' 
as is required for scienter-based claims.  See Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185, 193 
(1975)."  The District Court, in fact, found that Pattison acted with an intent to deceive.53 
                                                                                           It did 

       50 
               As the District Court found, "every stock option grant during the period in 
question has a grant date selected with hindsight, yet [Pattison]  never expressly disclosed the date 
of actual approval by CEO Wong on any document.  Nor did [Pattison] ever explicitly 
communicate to [the] auditors Embarcadero's practice of selecting grant dates with hindsight."

               "Mr. Pattison fails to explain how a knowing falsification is really anything 
different from an intent to deceive.  In other words, if a person intentionally makes a false 
statement (found here), that is tantamount to an intent to deceive. . . . As noted in the legislative 
history for § 13, '[t]he knowledge required is that the person be aware that he is or may be 
making a false statement or causing corporate records to be falsified through a conscious 
undertaking or due to his conscious disregard for the truth.'  S. Rep. 95-114, at 4107."   SEC v.

No. C-08-4238 EMC (N.D. Cal. June 9, 2011), at 14.  Pattison also claims that, because the 
District Court used a general verdict form, "one cannot even determine whether Mr. Pattison was 
found liable for a 'knowing falsification of records' or, instead, an internal controls violation." 
The jury, however, found that Pattison violated Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) pursuant to a jury 
                                                                                    (continued...)

so, not as a misstatement of the jury's finding of a violation, but in connection with the Court's 
assessment of the necessity of imposing an injunction as a remedy for that violation.  Pattison is 
estopped from attacking here the factual findings or legal conclusions of the underlying 
injunctive proceeding.54 
                          In any event, we are unpersuaded by his argument. 

       We do not construe the term "scienter" so narrowly.  While it is true that the United 
States Supreme Court in Ernst & Ernst                          defined scienter as "a mental state embracing intent to 
deceive, manipulate, or defraud," it did so in the context of a securities fraud case.  There, the 
Court predicated the actor's state of mind on elements, i.e., deceit, manipulation, and fraud, that 
explicitly were the basis for the violation at issue.  The Supreme Court, however, also discussed 
scienter more generally as "knowing or intentional misconduct," given that the issue in that case 
was "whether scienter is a necessary element" of a private cause of action under Exchange Act 
Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, or "whether negligent conduct alone is sufficient." 55 
                                                                                                
Courts have consistently relied on the broader definition of scienter in the context of violations of 
the federal securities laws.     We, too, have viewed scienter through a wider lens. 56 57

       Here, the District Court found that Pattison acted with scienter based on his conduct. 
Specifically, the District Court found: 

       While the instant case is a civil action and not a criminal action, the § 13 jury 
       instruction that the parties agreed upon stated that knowing falsification was 
       required – in other words, the SEC (although it did not have to) agreed to the 
       criminal liability scienter requirement.  Accordingly, there was scienter in this 
       case (in the sense of a knowing falsification); at least, the jury so found.58 

       The District Court found that Pattison provided sincere assurances against future 
violations but that he also had not recognized the wrongful nature of his conduct.  For example, 
the Court found that Pattison voluntarily disclosed his misconduct to attorneys representing 
Embarcadero's Special Committee and voluntarily met with the Commission during its 
investigation.  But the Court also found that Pattison either placed blame for stock options 
backdating on others or denied any wrongdoing.  Indeed, Pattison continues to dispute that his 
conduct was egregious and argues that "books and records claims do not fall under the antifraud 
provisions of the securities laws, and should not be addressed with the 'severest of sanctions.'"  
We are concerned that, despite his assurances against future violations, Pattison's failure to 
appreciate the gravity of his misconduct raises troubling questions about his fitness to appear and 
practice before the Commission.  

       Pattison asserts that the likelihood is low that his occupation will present opportunities 
for future violations.  He states that he has "worked for the last seven years without any blemish 
on his record.  He has not moved professionally towards the public sector, and even submitted a 
Declaration in the District Court action expressly stating he had no intention to work for a public 
company again."  He also asserts that his "employment history since leaving Embarcadero bears

               (...continued) 
(July 29, 2003), 80 SEC Docket 2694, 2704-05 & n.14 ("The question is not whether an 
accountant recklessly intended to aid in the fraud committed by the audit client, but rather 
whether the accountant recklessly violated applicable professional standards [in connection with 
a proceeding brought under Rule 102(e)(1)]."), reversed on other grounds, 374 F.3d at 1205 
(rejecting respondents' contention that, because the Commission borrowed the definition of 
recklessness used in substantive antifraud provisions for purposes of a proceeding under Rule 
102(e)(1), the Commission also was required to adopt other elements of a securities fraud 
violation, such as the requirements of an intent to defraud and materiality). 
       58 
               To the extent that Pattison contends that scienter must be an element of the 
underlying violations in order for us to evaluate the degree of scienter under the Steadman 
factors, he is incorrect.  See Steadman, 603 F.2d at 1140 ("We heartily endorse the Commission's 
view that while scienter is not required to make out violations of several of the statutory sections 
involved here, the respondent's state of mind is highly relevant in determining the remedy to 
impose.").

                                               19
 

that out.  Pattison has changed jobs—he no longer works for a public company and instead 
performs trust and estate work [as an accountant] for a company owned by a private individual." 
  
       Pattison, however, remains licensed as a CPA.  Moreover, the Court found that Pattison 
stated in his deposition that his work for the company is "[m]uch the same as what I would do at 
a public accounting firm."59 
                             Should the company go public or be acquired by a public company, 
the accuracy of its historical books and records could be critical, and Pattison could potentially 
find himself in a position to handle the company's future accounting duties.  Moreover, Pattison's 
statement that he "is not likely to appear before the Commission again, but . . . has demonstrated 
over these last seven years that he possesses the skills and moral character to do so in the future," 
suggests the possibility of his eventually appearing and practicing before the Commission.  We 
conclude that a reasonable likelihood exists that Pattison's occupation will present opportunities 
for future violations.60 

       Pattison asserts that the law judge improperly granted summary disposition because he 
presented mitigating facts that required an evidentiary hearing.  Rule of Practice 250(b) provides 
that a hearing officer may grant a motion for summary disposition without an in-person hearing if 
"there is no genuine issue with regard to any material fact and the party making the motion is 
entitled to a summary disposition as a matter of law."61 
                                                         Once the Division showed that it had 
satisfied the criteria for summary disposition, Pattison had the opportunity to produce documents, 
affidavits, or some other evidence to demonstrate that there was a genuine and material factual 
dispute that the law judge could not resolve without a hearing. 

       Pattison's submissions below "relate[d] to the appropriateness of the sanction," which we 
have considered fully above, but did not raise "the existence of a genuine issue of material 

       59 
               See supra note 53, Order Denying Defendant's Motion for Judgment of Law and 
Motion for a New Trial; and Granting in Part and Denying in Part Defendant's Motion to Amend 
Judgment, at 12. 
       60 
               Pattison cites to SEC v. Monarch Fund, 608 F.2d 938, 943 (2d. Cir. 1979), and 
SEC v. Nat'l Student Mktg. Corp., 457 F. Supp. 682 (D. D.C. 1978) for the proposition that "the 
more time that has passed since a violation, the lesser the need for an injunctive sanction." 
Pattison's citations are inapposite.  In these cases, the courts considered the propriety of imposing 
an injunction.  As we have discussed, the propriety of Pattison's injunction is not at issue. 
Moreover, these cases suggest that courts consider the amount of time that has elapsed since the 
last violation as one among many factors in evaluating whether there exists a reasonable 
likelihood of future violations.

fact."62 
        An in-person hearing therefore was not required.  Pattison states that it is mitigating that 
he has worked for the last seven years without a blemish on his record, has not moved 
professionally towards the public sector, and voluntarily told the Special Committee that he 
backdated stock option grants.  We already have accepted these facts as true and taken them into 
consideration above. 

       Pattison also states that he "was still working at Embarcadero for almost a year after the 
alleged violations occurred and thus his compliance with these statutes began while he was still 
working at Embarcadero."  Yet Pattison also highlights the fact that, by the end of 2004, the 
company, not Pattison, decided to enforce the prohibition against granting in-the-money stock 
options and that none was granted thereafter as a result.  Pattison asserts that he was "absolved by 
a jury of all fraud and [aiding and abetting] false reporting charges," and the violation occurred 
nearly seven years ago.  While we accept these statements as true, we do not agree that the need 
for a permanent suspension is diminished given the other facts of this case.  Pattison also argues 
that we should consider as mitigating that the District Court prevented him from presenting "his 
key accounting expert" 63
                         and improperly admitted as evidence Embarcadero's Form 10-K for the 
2006 fiscal year, which restated numerous portions of financial statements for previous years, and 
that the Division failed to designate expert witnesses at the trial.  Pattison is prohibited from 
attempting to relitigate the District Court's findings.64 

       Pattison argues that a permanent suspension is "far in excess of other accountants who 
have had securities fraud judgments entered against them for backdating stock options."  The

(D.C. Cir. 2010). 
       63 
               Pattison attached to his reply brief the accounting expert's "anticipated testimony" 
that he asserts he "was required to provide to the District Court," and which was intended to 
support his argument that his conduct was not egregious.  Commission Rule of Practice 452, 17 
C.F.R. § 201.452, permits the admission of additional evidence where the evidence is material 
and where there exist reasonable grounds for failing to produce the evidence earlier.  Pattison has 
not met the rule's requirements.  He filed no motion to adduce this additional evidence.  Nor did 
he provide an explanation for his failure to adduce the document earlier (i.e., before the law 
judge or in earlier filings on appeal) or respond when the Division challenged his submission. 
Pattison also does not explain how this attachment is material.  We nevertheless admit it as a 
matter of discretion.

cases to which Pattison cites, however, were settled matters.65 
                                                              We have repeatedly observed that 
comparisons to sanctions in settled cases are inappropriate because respondents who offer to 
settle may properly receive lesser sanctions than they otherwise might have.  That is because, "in 
settlement cases we take into account pragmatic considerations such as the avoidance of 
time-and-manpower-consuming adversary proceedings."    66

              In all of the cited cases, respondents settled both the underlying injunctive matter 
and the follow-on Rule 102(e) proceeding.  See Antonio Canova                                           , Exchange Act Rel. No. 59758

       Pattison also refers to the result in Robert W. Armstrong, III, 58 S.E.C. 542 (2005), a 
litigated case, where an accountant was found to have violated the antifraud provisions and was 
not permanently suspended under Rule 102(e).  Armstrong is not applicable here.  That matter 
was brought under Rule 102(e)(1), which, as we have explained, involves procedures and 
standards different from those in a Rule 102(e)(3) proceeding.  Moreover, "in light of the unique 
circumstances [in that case], we . . . determined, as an exercise of our equitable discretion, not to 
impose any suspension" pursuant to Rule 102(e)(1) without providing any analysis or identifying 
the unique circumstances leading to this result.  Accordingly, Armstrong provides no 
precedential guidance with respect to the imposition of sanctions pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3).

proceeding based on an underlying injunction that he should not receive a harsher sanction than 
that imposed on other individuals who committed violations similar to the one for which he was 
enjoined but where the other individuals settled their administrative proceedings); Leslie A. 
Arouh, 57 S.E.C. 1099, 1123 (2004) (rejecting respondent's argument that sanction was unjust 
where more culpable respondent received lesser sanction); cf. Dennis Todd Lloyd Gordon, 
Exchange Act Rel. No. 57655 (Apr. 11, 2008), 93 SEC Docket 5089, 5118 (where NASD had 
previously offered to settle charges for lesser sanctions than ultimately imposed after litigation, 
Commission rejected argument that NASD's alleged willingness to accept a lesser sanction in 
settlement shows that NASD did not consider that more stringent sanctions were necessary, 
noting "it is well established that those who offer to settle may properly receive lesser sanctions 
than they otherwise might have based on 'pragmatic considerations such as the avoidance of 
time-and-manpower-consuming adversary proceedings.'").

       The appropriate sanction in any case, moreover, depends on the particular facts and 
circumstances presented. 67 
                            Litigated cases typically present a fuller, more developed record of 
facts and circumstances for purposes of assessing appropriate sanctions than do settled matters.68 
                                                                                                  
Here, the record shows that, although Pattison was not found liable on the fraud charge in the 
injunctive action, the Court made extensive findings in justification of the injunction against him 
concerning the egregiousness of the conduct and his level of scienter.  As discussed above, these 
violations go to the heart of an accountant's obligations in any practice before the Commission 
and justify the bar against such practice.69 

       67 
               See Robert L. Burns, Advisers Act Rel. No. 3260 (Aug. 5, 2011), 101 SEC Docket 
44807, 44824 n.52 ("[I]t is well established that the appropriateness of a sanction 'depends on the 
facts and circumstances of each particular case and cannot be precisely determined by 
comparison with the action taken in other proceedings.'") (citing  Paz Sec., Inc., Exchange Act 
Rel. No. 57656 (Apr. 11, 2008), 93 SEC Docket 5122, 5134, petition denied, 566 F.3d 1172 
(D.C. Cir. 2009) (citing      Butz v. Glover Livestock Comm'n Co., 411 U.S. 182, 187 (1973)); cf. 
World Trade Fin. Corp., Exchange Act Rel. No. 66114 (Jan. 6, 2012), 102 SEC Docket 49942, 
49966 & n.82 (noting, in review of FINRA matter, that the "appropriate sanction, however, 
depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and cannot be precisely determined by 
comparison with action taken in other proceedings.") (citing Butz, 411 U.S. at 187); see also 
McCarthy, 406 F.3d at 188 (stating that an appeals court's review of Commission sanctions 
"receives only limited benefit from comparison to sanctions imposed in other cases due to the 
highly fact-dependent nature of the propriety of sanctions"); Hiller v. SEC, 429 F.2d 856, 858 
(2d Cir. 1970) (rejecting respondent's argument that the imposition of lesser sanctions in other 
cases involving purportedly more serious violations is inconsistent and stating that "we cannot 
disturb the sanctions ordered in one case because they were different from those imposed in an 
entirely different proceeding") (citing  Tager v. SEC, 344 F.2d 5, 8-9 (2d Cir. 1965) ("Failing a 
gross abuse of discretion, the courts should not attempt to substitute their untutored views as to 
what sanctions will best accord with the regulatory powers of the Commission.")). 
       68 
               See Nassar and Co., Inc., 47 S.E.C. at 26.  In the settled matters cited by Pattison, 
for example, we do not have a record that would permit a comparison with all the Steadman 
factors influencing a sanction decision, such as the likelihood that a respondent's occupation will 
present opportunities for future violations. 
       69 
               Pattison argues that a bar is unprecedented and that no accountant has "ever been 
permanently barred from practicing in front of the Commission for a books and records 
violation."  For the reasons discussed in the text, we believe the bar against practice before the 
Commission is justified here because of the connection between the nature of the violation and 
the duties involved in any practice by an accountant before the Commission.

       As we have stated, "[t]he Commission disciplines professionals pursuant to Rule 102(e) 
in order to 'protect the integrity of its processes.'"70 
                                                    The Commission adopted the rule as a 
"means to ensure that those professionals, on whom the Commission relies heavily in the 
performance of its statutory duties, perform their tasks diligently and with a reasonable degree of 
competence." 71 
                We believe that permanently disqualifying Pattison from appearing or practicing 
before the Commission is remedial because it will prevent Pattison and deter others from 
disregarding their professional responsibilities and protect the investing public by encouraging 
reliable corporate disclosure and accountability through accurate recordkeeping and diligent 
compliance with internal accounting controls. 

       An appropriate order will issue.72
