                                           FINDINGS
  
 
The Commission makes the following findings   1
                                               : 
 
       A.      RESPONDENTS  
        
       <comp.>Microtune</>, a Delaware corporation headquartered   in Plano, Texas, develops and sells 
integrated radio frequency-based products for the broadband and automotive markets.  Microtune’s 
common stock is registered with the Commission under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and is 
traded on the NASDAQ National Market.    2 
                                               
        
       Housley, age 49, is a resident of Tempe, Arizona.  Housley joined Microtune in April 2001 
as its vice president of marketing and sales.  In that capacity, Housley was responsible for directing 
Microtune’s marketing strategies and managing the sales force and customer service department.  
Housley became Microtune’s chief operating officer (“COO”) in August 2001 and its president in 
December 2001, before his termination in April 2003.  During 2001 and 2002, Housley exercised 
options upon 39,319 shares of Microtune common stock and sold 29,444 of those shares for a net 
profit of approximately $288,000.  
 
       Rogers, age 48, is a resident of Vincennes, Indiana.  Rogers joined Microtune in 1998 and 
became its chief financial officer (“CFO”) in January 2000.  Rogers signed Microtune’s Form 10-Q 
for the third quarter of 2001, 2001 Form 10-K, and Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2002.  Rogers 
has never been a licensed CPA and had no CFO experience prior to his employment at Microtune.  
Rogers served as CFO until July 2002, when Microtune’s board of directors reassigned him to vice 
president of investor relations; Rogers resigned three months later.   
        
       Davis, age 45, is a resident of Prosper, Texas.  Davis joined Microtune in September 2001 as 
vice president of worldwide sales and marketing and was later promoted to executive vice president 
of worldwide sales and marketing in Janua     ry 2002.  Following his promotion, Davis, under 
Housley’s supervision, assumed responsibility for  the Microtune sales force and the customer 
service department, which processed customer orders.  Davis left Microtune in August 2003.  

                                                                                                                                                             
1 
       The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondents’ Offers and are not binding on any other person or entity  
in these or any other proceedings. 
  
2 
       For approximately ten months between July 2003 and April 2004, Microtune’s common stock was quoted on 
the “pink sheets,” after it was delisted by NASDAQ for Microt une’s failure to file timely with the Commission its  
periodic reports.  However, during the course of the scheme discussed herein, Microtune’s common stock traded on the 
NASDAQ National Market.

       B. FACTS        
 
              1. Background     

       Microtune, formed in 1996, was a typical     “high tech” start-up company employing a 
preponderance of engineers focused on resear ch and development.  From 1996 through 2001, 
Microtune experienced rapid growth through multiple acquisitions, an initial public offering, and 
a registered follow-on offering.  As the compa ny grew, various departments such as accounting, 
customer service, manufacturing, and sales were       established at its Plano headquarters.      
Microtune had no revenues prior to its Ja      nuary 2000 acquisition of Temic Telefunken 
Hochfrequenztechnik GmbH (“Temic”), a German  supplier of radio frequency-based products.   
In late 2001, Microtune continued its rapid growth by acquiring a wireless company and 
completing a $109 million registered offering.   
 
                           2. Housley’s Arrival at Microtune  
        
       Prior to Housley’s arrival at Microtune in   April 2001, substantially all of Microtune’s 
revenues were derived from sales to end-users of the company’s products.  In April 2001, Housley 
and others realized that the customer sales forecasted for the second half of 2001 would not match 
quarterly revenue projections of 5-10% consecutive year, same-quarter growth.  This shortfall was 
due to a depressed business environment in the semiconductor sector, exacerbated by the events of 
September 11, 2001.  Instead of reducing its revenue   projections, Microtune modified its sales 
strategy by emphasizing sales to distributors, which generally purchase and stock large quantities of  
product for eventual resale to end-use customers.  As discussed below, Housley used various 
incentives to entice distributors (and, in some instances, end-use customers) to place large orders or 
accept large shipments of product for Microtune to meet the company’s revenue forecasts.   
        
       By means of the scheme described herein, Microtune met or exceeded the second, third, and 
fourth quarter revenue projections in 2001.   Fo llowing Microtune’s successful acquisition of a 
wireless company (“Transilica”) and its registered offering in the fourth quarter of 2001, Microtune 
published even more aggressive revenue projections for 2002, relying heavily on anticipated 
revenues from its newly acquired, yet unproven, wireless company.  In order to meet the projections, 
Microtune expanded the scheme in 2002.  Microtune met its quarterly revenue projections for the 
first half of 2002; in the third quarter of 2002,  however, Microtune missed its revenue projection, 
and the scheme began to unravel. 
        
              3.      The Elements of Microtune’s Revenue-Inflation Scheme 
               
               a.            Sales Concessions   
        
       In order to meet revenue projections, Housley and Davis granted sales concessions to 
Microtune’s customers and distributors to indu  ce them to issue purchase orders (“POs”) for 
quantities of product exceeding their inventory needs and current demands.  The concessions took 
various forms: price protection, expanded rights of return and extended payment terms.  They were 
conveyed to customers and distributors orally, by e-mail, and through side agreements; as a result of 
 
                                               3
 
---------------------Page 4---------------------

the concessions, Microtune was precluded, pursuant to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 
(“GAAP”), from immediately recognizing revenue from the sales.  As discussed more fully below, 
Housley and Davis did not disclose many of the concessions to Microtune’s accounting department 
and its outside auditors; in a few instances the  concessions appeared on POs from customers or 
distributors, but were not detected by the accounting department due to the company’s poor internal 
controls. 
        
       Housley knew or was reckless in not knowing and Davis knew or should have known that 
the undisclosed concessions could be improper: in December 2001, the company’s controller 
outlined to Housley and Davis how sales concessions such as rights of return, stock rotation rights, 
price protection, “flexible” payment terms and extended payment terms in some circumstances can 
preclude revenue recognition under GAAP.  The controller also emphasized the importance of his 
reviewing all distributor agreements before execution to avoid accounting issues that could cause 
“surprising negative consequences to revenue after the fact.”  Housley and Davis failed to follow the 
controller’s accounting advice.  In many cases, Housley knew or was reckless in not knowing and 
Davis knew or should have known that revenue recognition could be negated if they granted the 
sales concessions; in other instances, they discove  red after the fact that the concessions were 
improper for purposes of recognizing revenue from the sales.  In both cases, there were occasions 
when Microtune’s accounting department was not notified of the concessions and the revenue was 
improperly recognized. 
        
                                (1) Price Protection 
        
       Price protection was offered as a concession   to Microtune’s distributors, sometimes to 
guarantee that the distributor would earn a minimum profit upon resale of a product, and other 
times to guarantee that the distributor would not lose money upon resale.     3
                                                                                 The mechanism for 
making good on the guarantees was a “price protec       tion credit” payable by Microtune to the 
distributor upon the distributor’s resale of th  e goods.  The payment of the credit, at times, 
occurred many quarters after the underlying sale       of Microtune’s product to the distributor.      
While price protection arrangements are not   per se improper, Microtune recognized revenue 
from sales subject to price protection when  it should not have under GAAP.  GAAP precludes 
recognizing revenue from a sale of goods until it is realized or realizable and earned.          See 
Statement of Financial Accounti ng Concepts No. 5 (“CON 5”);  see also SEC Staff Accounting 
Bulletin No. 101 (“SAB 101”).  Under GAAP, if a company can reasonably and reliably estimate 
the amount of price protection expos ure at the time of the sale, the sale (net of an allowance for 
the price protection credit expected to be paid) can be recognized as revenue.       4
                                                                                        But if price 

                                                                                                                                                             
3 
       In either instance, price protection effectively redu ced Microtune’s aggregate sales price and should have, under 
GAAP, reduced its revenue from the underlying sale.   
 
4 
       For example, assume a company sold a product for $100 to a distributor subject to price protection.  If the 
company can reasonably and reliably estimate its price protection exposure (for example, by establishing a minimum   
price for the distributor’s resale), then the company can record the sale as revenue net of a price protection allowance.  In 
this example, if the company established a $95 resale price,  then the company can properly record $95 as revenue at the 
time of shipment and a $5 price protection allowance. 
 
 
                                                  4
 
---------------------Page 5---------------------

protection exposure cannot be reasonably and relia bly estimated, all revenue must be deferred 
until such estimate can be made or  the price protection period ends ( i.e., the distributor sells the 
product to its end customer).     
        
       Because Microtune did not establish a minimum price at which distributors were required 
to resell their product, the company had no way   of predicting price protection exposure until a 
distributor actually sold the product to its e   nd customer.  Therefore, Microtune could not 
estimate an allowance for price protection and      should have deferred all revenue from sales 
subject to price protection.  Instead, Microtune recognized 100 percent of the revenue at the time 
the product was shipped to distributors – in violation of GAAP. 
        
                               (2)     Expanded Rights of Return 
        
       Another form of sales concession involved expanded rights of return.  Housley and Davis 
at times agreed to excessive stock rotation for Microtune products that remained unsold in a 
distributor’s inventory for as long as one year after initial delivery of the product.  5
                                                                                          Moreover, 
Housley granted broad return rights with no requi  rement that the distributor buy an offsetting 
amount of Microtune products.  Under Statemen  t of Financial Accounting Standards No. 48 
(“SFAS 48”), the revenue from a sale with a right of return cannot be recognized if, among other 
things, the buyer has not paid the seller and has no obligation to pay until the product is resold.    
Because Housley granted return rights to customers and distributors who had not paid for the 
products and had no obligation to pay until th        ey sold the products, Microtune’s upfront 
recognition of revenue was improper.  Such expa       nded rights of return were not disclosed to 
Microtune’s accounting department or to its outside auditors.   
        
                               (3)     Extended Payment Terms 
        
       The final type of sales concession granted   by Microtune was extended payment terms.   
Pursuant to Microtune’s credit policy, payment wa s required within 30 days, or, alternatively, a 
letter of credit for the full amount owed was      required.  Housley and Davis, however, made 
exceptions to this policy, granting 60-180 day payment terms.  Housley even gave extensions of 
these outlying due dates.  At other times, Hous ley and Davis granted “flexible” payment terms, 
where the distributor was expected to pay Microtune only after the distributor sold the product to 
an end customer – whenever that occurred.  Sales made contingent upon the resale of the product 
to an end-user clearly do not support recognition of revenue under GAAP.   See SFAS 48; CON 
5.  In addition, SAB 101 requires reasonable assura nce of collectibility before revenue can be 
recognized from a sale.  By recognizing reve       nue from orders that included extended and 
“flexible” payment terms, where the ultimate pa yment for the product was uncertain, Microtune 
did not comply with GAAP.  
        
                                                                                                                                                             
5 
       Two of Microtune’s distributor agreements provided for limited rights of return, called “stock rotation rights.”  
Under this provision, Microtune’s distributors could return up to 15% of the Microtune products they purchased over the 
prior six-month period, so long as th ey submitted a PO for an amount of re placement product exactly offsetting the 
returned amount.  Housley, however, routinely made exceptions to this express contractual requirement, granting stock  
rotation rights with terms more liberal than those specified in the distributor agreements.   
 
                                                  5 
---------------------Page 6---------------------

                       b.     Overshipments of Product  
               
        To meet Microtune’s rising revenue projecti ons, Housley authorized “channel-stuffing”; 
that is, he directed that Microtune product be  shipped to customers and distributors in amounts 
greater than the amounts specified in their POs.  Upon receipt of the overshipment, the customers 
typically insisted upon returning the excess produc    t.  However, after Housley granted them    
various sales concessions, which in most cases  would have precluded revenue recognition under 
GAAP, the recipients typically agreed to retain     the excess product.  In some instances, at 
Housley’s request, they agreed to submit re     vised POs matching the overshipped quantities.       
Microtune improperly recorded the revenue from the overshipments. 
 
                        c.    Inadequate Internal Controls  
        
       Microtune’s fraudulent revenue-inflation scheme went undetected because Microtune had 
inadequate internal controls over its revenue recognition.   6
                                                                This was due, in large part, to 
Microtune’s order entry process, which was flawed.  Customers and distributors typically submitted 
POs by facsimile to Microtune’s customer service  department – an arm of its sales department 
reporting to Housley and Davis.  Customer serv ice personnel then reviewed the PO and entered 
information from the PO into Microtune’s computerized order system.  After the PO information 
was entered, the shipping department prepared th e product for shipment.  Upon shipment of the 
product, the accounting department created an invoice and recorded the revenue.   
        
       Unfortunately, the customer service personnel, lacking proper training and supervision, 
failed to identify sales concessions, such as price protection, rights of return, and extended payment 
terms, in those instances where the concessions were actually set forth in writing on POs they 
processed.  (In other instances, the concessions were strictly oral, and did not appear on the POs.) As 
a consequence, they routinely entered POs in       to the order system without recording the 
accompanying sales concessions.  Because the concessions were not entered into the order system, 
they did not come to the attention of the accounting department, which processed the invoices.       
Compounding the problem, when Microtune’s accounting department performed occasional reviews 
of invoices, the relevant POs, which may have s hown the concessions, were not attached to the 
invoices.  Consequently, the accounting department, unaware of the existence of many of the sales 
concessions, remained unaware of the existence of revenue recognition issues.   
        
       Rogers, as CFO, was chiefly responsible for Mi crotune’s inadequate internal controls and 
procedures.  He established or approved the flawed order entry system, in which customer service 
personnel, untrained in accounting, were responsible for identifying and entering the relevant sales 
terms into Microtune’s accounting system.  Rogers also ignored the concerns of Microtune’s outside 
auditors about the process.  For example, the auditors alerted Microtune’s management in January    
2002 that, in response to Microtune’s increasing reliance on sales to distributors, the company

       Following the January 2000 Temic ac quisition, Microtune struggled to integrate Temic’s Germany and Far 
East-based accounting and customer service functions with  the company’s Plano-based accounting and customer service 
departments.  A substantial number of POs from foreign customers and distributors were processed overseas – until the  
accounting and customer service departments were centralized in Plano in July 2002.

needed to strengthen its revenue recognition cont  rols.  The auditors suggested that Microtune 
employ a revenue recognition checklist, which       included obtaining all signed POs from the 
customer, documentation of title transfer, and documentation of rights of return.  Rogers, 
however, took no steps to implement the auditors ’ suggestions, leaving the order entry process 
uncorrected. 
        
       Rogers’s lapses can be attributed, in part, to the fact that he is not a CPA, and that he devoted 
substantially all of his time to investor relati  ons, relying heavily on his controller to manage 
Microtune’s accounting functions.  Unfortunately, the controller, who was a CPA, resigned from  
Microtune in March 2002.  This left a void in  the accounting department until a new CFO was 
retained in July 2002.  Eventually, Microtune’s new CFO and new controller improved Microtune’s 
internal controls in the fourth quarter of 2002, largely through the implementation of an improved 
order processing system – but not until after the revenue-inflation scheme had run its course.  
        
               4.      Microtune’s Revenue Inflation Scheme  
                
       Microtune granted very favorable sales concessions to at least five distributors and 
overshipped product to at least two of them.  In each case, Microtune improperly recorded the 
revenue from those alleged sales.  In additi on, Microtune improperly recorded revenue when it 
shipped product to a customer prior to the customer’s requested ship date and the customer refused 
to accept the shipment.  The scheme resulted in  total overstated revenue of approximately $19.2 
million from the third quarter of 2001 through the third quarter of 2002; the revenue overstatements 
ranged from 5 percent to 77 percent quarterly.   
                        
                       a.     Overseas Customer No. 1  
        
       In May 2001, Housley offered sales concessions for the first time.  Overseas Customer No. 1 
(“OC1”), a Hong Kong-based company, told Housley that it intended to cancel its second quarter 
2001 order (approximately $600,000) because of the weakening economy.  Housley convinced OC1 
not to cancel by agreeing to OC1’s demands for price protection.  Consequently, Microtune recorded 
$600,000 of revenue in the second quarter of 2001. Housley did not tell company personnel about 
the OC1 price protection agreement, which was reduced to writing in a September 7, 2001 e-mail.  
Following Housley’s execution of the price protection agreement, he failed to provide a copy of it to 
the customer service department, the accounting department or the outside auditors.   
        
       In late 2001, OC1 requested several price       protection credits, totaling approximately 
$38,000.7
           Because price protection is not   per se improper, and because the amount of each 
credit request was immaterial and approved by   Housley, no one in the accounting department 
questioned the credits.  In the first quarter of  2002, OC1 requested credits for price protection 
totaling approximately $280,000.  This amount was material.  Eventually, Housley conceded that 

                                                                                                                                                             
7 
       “Credits” denote a reduction in the purchase price   to be paid by a distri butor for goods (i.e., accounts 
receivable).  Microtune did not issue credits in the form of cash refunds, but rather as offsets against amounts owed. 
 
 
                                                 7

he offered OC1 price protection and produced to the controller the September 7, 2001 
agreement. 
Microtune recorded the $280,000 credit as a reduction in its first quarter 2002 revenue.  As part 
of its restatement, however, Microtune determin  ed that the total amount of the OC1 credits 
($318,000) should have been recorded as a reduc tion of revenue in the third quarter 2001, the 
period in which the price protection agreement was entered into. 
                       
                      b.      Overseas Customer No. 2  
        
       Following $1 million in order cancellations   in September 2001, Housley scrambled to 
replace lost third quarter sales.   Housley appr oached Overseas Customer No. 2 (“OC2”), a 
Taiwanese company that had been acting as Microtune’s sales representative in the Far East, and 
convinced it to become a Microtune distributor.  In a September 26, 2001 e-mail to OC2’s CEO, 
Housley agreed to provide price protection in exchange for OC2’s placing a large order; the next day 
OC2 placed a $300,000 order and demanded price protection.       8
                                                                    Housley failed to provide to 
Microtune’s accounting department the September 26 e-mail or otherwise inform them about the 
price protection agreement.  Realizing that quarterly sales, even including the $300,000 order, were 
insufficient to meet revenue projections, Housley authorized the total shipment of $700,000 of goods 
to OC2; in effect, Microtune overshipped them  $400,000 of goods.  On the eve of shipment, Housley 
called OC2’s CEO and convinced him to accept the total $700,000 shipment by granting OC2 100 
percent stock rotation rights for the entire order. 
        
       At the end of the same quarter, OC2 place d another $300,000 order.  Because Microtune 
lacked sufficient completed product to fulfill the   order, Housley discussed with the head of 
manufacturing the shipment of unfinished product  and the fact that such product would require 
additional processing by Microtune.   After this discussion, Housley authorized the shipment of 
unfinished product, even though he knew OC2 w          ould return it for additional processing.    
Microtune’s accounting department was unaware of  the shipment of unfinished product and the 
stock rotation rights.  Although OC2 returned the unfinished product to Microtune in the following 
quarter for additional processing, Microtune did not reverse the corresponding revenue entries.  In 
violation of GAAP, Microtune recorded the sales to OC2 (including the sale of unfinished product) 
as third quarter 2001 revenue. 
        
       In this time frame, there was intense pressu re to make numbers because of the pending 
Transilica acquisition and registered offering.    During the fourth quarter of 2001, Housley 
negotiated, by e-mail, a $1.4 million order with OC  2 that included price protection, “flexible” 
payment terms, and 100 percent stock rotation.  Even though Housley did not disclose the OC2 e-
mail to the accounting department, and therefore did  not alert them to the existence of the sales 
concessions, OC2 submitted a PO to Microtune that contained price protection and “flexible” 
payment term notations.  In addition, Housley authorized the overshipment of $100,000 of product 
to OC2 with the same concessions, which OC2 ultimately accepted.   
        
                                                                                                                                                             
8 
       OC2’s September 27, 2001 PO for $300,000 did not include any reference to price protection. 
 
 
                                                8 
---------------------Page 9---------------------

       Later that quarter, Microtune’s controller lear ned that the OC2 sale included “flexible” 
payment terms.  The controller insisted upon the cancellation of the special concessions and directed 
that a revised OC2 PO be submitted.  9
                                        Soon thereafter, OC2 produced a revised PO that contained 
acceptable 90-day payment terms instead of “flexible” payment terms, and omitted any reference to 
price protection or 100 percent stock rotation.10 
                                                                           Nonetheless, Housley agreed to additional terms 
that were not reflected in the revised PO.      Housley did not inform Microtune’s accounting 
department of the discrepancy between the revised  PO and the actual agreement.  In violation of 
GAAP, Microtune recorded the entire  $1.5 million shipment to OC2 as fourth quarter 2001 revenue; 
Microtune should have reduced the revenue by the amount of the concessions.   
        
       During 2002, Housley and Davis struggled to ensu re that OC2 placed sufficient orders to 
meet Microtune’s quarterly revenue targets.   They convinced OC2 to place multiple orders for 
Microtune product totaling nearly $5 million, by granting OC2 sales concessions including price 
protection, rights of return, and “flexible” payment terms.  Microtune recorded all the OC2 sales as 
revenue at the time of shipment, in violation of GAAP.  Approximately half of OC2’s POs submitted 
to Microtune in 2002 contained references to sales concessions; none of the concessions were 
detected or properly recorded by Microtune’s accounting department.  In the other sales, the POs 
contained no reference to the concessions granted by Housley and Davis, resulting in Microtune’s 
improperly recognizing revenue upon shipment to OC2. 
        
                       c.     Overseas Customer No. 3  
        
       In the third quarter of 2001, Housley convinced Overseas Customer No. 3 (“OC3”), a 
Taiwanese company, to become a Microtune distributor and to place large orders for Microtune’s 
products.  OC3 agreed to become a Microtune distributor in return for Housley’s consent to price 
protection and expanded rights of return.  OC3 placed a third quarter 2001 order for $650,000; to 
meet revenue goals, Housley authorized, instead, the shipment of $950,000 of Microtune products.  
Housley orally authorized the shipment of unfinished product to OC3 as part of the overshipment, 
knowing that the unfinished product had not undergone a required heat process and would likely be 
returned.  Housley did not disclose to the accounting department the likelihood of returned product; 
consequently, when the unfinished product was returned to Microtune the following quarter for heat 
treatment and testing, Microtune did not reverse the corresponding revenues.  Instead, Microtune 
recorded, in violation of GAAP, approximately $950,000 as third quarter 2001 revenue. 
        
       During the fourth quarter of 2001, Housley approved by e-mail an $800,000 order from OC3 
that included price protection, rights of return, and “flexible” payment terms.  Even though Housley 
failed to provide the e-mail, or otherwise disc    lose the sales concessions to the accounting 

                                                                                                                                                             
9 
       The controller had advised Housley and Davis in a December 2001 e-mail that “flexible” payment terms nullify 
revenue recognition under GAAP. 
 
10 
       Despite the controller’s earlier advice, Davis confirmed to OC2 in an April 16, 2002 e-mail, which Housley also 
received, that “flexible” payment terms applied to the $1.5 million fourth quarter 2001 order.  Neither Davis nor Housley 
forwarded this e-mail to Microtune’s accounting department   or otherwise disclosed the existence of the “flexible” 
payment terms.   
 
 
                                                 9

department, OC3’s PO reflected the concessions.  The concessions, nonetheless, were not detected 
by Microtune’s accounting department, because its  customer service department, which did not 
realize the accounting importance of the concessions, failed to enter them into the order system.  In 
addition, Housley authorized the overshipment of approximately $300,000 of product to OC3, which 
OC3 ultimately accepted after negotiations with   Housley.  In violation of GAAP, Microtune 
recorded in the fourth quarter 2001 the entire $1.1 million as revenue from sales.  
        
       During 2002, Housley and Davis convinced OC 3 to submit POs to Microtune totaling 
approximately $3.5 million in exchange for pr  ice protection, 100 percent stock rotation, and 
extended payment terms.  Microtune recorded all  OC3 sales as revenue at the time of shipment 
despite the sales concessions.  With only one  exception, the POs OC3 submitted to Microtune in 
2002 made no reference to sales concessions.  In  addition, Housley and Davis did not disclose to 
Microtune’s accounting department the existence of the sales concessions.  Microtune improperly 
recognized approximately $3.5 million as revenue from shipments to OC3 in 2002. 
        
                     d.      Overseas Customer No. 4  
        
       During the fourth quarter of 2001, Housley  and Davis secured a $1.2 million sales order 
from Overseas Customer No. 4 (“OC4”), a U.K. distributor, by agreeing to “flexible” payment terms 
and price protection.  Davis approved the “flexible” payment terms and price protection concessions 
by e-mail and copied Housley, but neither Davis nor Housley forwarded the e-mail or otherwise 
disclosed the concessions to Microtune’s accounting department.  OC4 submitted a $1.2 million PO 
on December 11, 2001 to Microtune, which omitted any reference to “flexible” payment terms and 
price protection.  In violation of GAAP, Microtune recorded $1.2 million in sales.   
        
                     e.      Overseas Customer No. 5  
        
       During fourth quarter of 2001 negotiations w  ith Overseas Customer No. 5 (“OC5”), a 
Taiwanese manufacturer, Housley granted “fle xible” payment terms to secure a $1.2 million 
sale.  Following OC5’s submission of a PO containing “flexible” payment terms, Microtune’s 
controller insisted that Housley cancel the con cessions and obtain a revised PO reflecting their 
cancellation.  The controller was unequivocal in his  instruction to Housley: “flexible” payment 
terms were unacceptable and would preclude Microtune’s recognizing revenue from the sale.  In 
response, Housley convinced OC5 to submit a PO  with 90-day payment terms, but executed and 
faxed from his home a side letter to OC5 on D ecember 31, 2001 in which he granted “flexible” 
payment terms, price protection and rights of re turn to OC5.  At quarter end, Housley also 
authorized overshipment of $200,000 of product to    OC5.  Housley concealed the OC5 side 
agreement from everyone at Microtune and from       Microtune’s outside auditors.  Even after 
Microtune’s accounting department asked Hous  ley for assistance collecting OC5’s overdue 
accounts receivable balance in 2002, Housley conceal  ed the OC5 side agreement.  Microtune 
improperly recognized the entire $1.4 million shipment  as revenue in the fourth quarter of 2001.

---------------------Page 11---------------------

                      f.     Overseas Customer No. 6  
        
       In September 2002, Davis convinced Overseas       Customer No. 6 (“OC6”), a Korean 
distributor, to place a large third quarter order  for Microtune’s wireless products.  On September 
28, 2002, OC6 submitted an incomplete PO to      Microtune for $1.4 million, which included a 
notation by OC6 that its shipping and billing addre sses and ship date would be confirmed by the 
following week.   According to Microtune’s cu     stomer service department personnel, both 
Housley and Davis demanded that the OC6 order ship by September 30 in order to meet 
quarterly revenue projections.  Microtune’s cust omer service department shipped the product on 
September 29, 2002.  Microtune recorded the $1.4  million OC6 sale as revenue upon shipment.   
On September 30, 2002, OC6 provided to Microtune a final and complete PO containing a 
Singapore delivery address, an October 7 ship date and additional terms and conditions.  As 
mentioned, Microtune had already shipped the product and it was en route to Singapore.   
        
       OC6 refused to accept the shipment because it was shipped a week earlier than stipulated 
on the final PO and immediately apprised Microt  une of its refusal.  Both Housley and Davis 
knew by early October 2002 that OC6 had refused  to accept the shipment; nonetheless, they did 
not notify the accounting department.  The shipme nt, which had been waylaid in a warehouse in 
Singapore because OC6 would not accept it, was          subsequently returned to Microtune.      
Microtune’s recognition of revenue from the $1.4  million sale in the third quarter of 2002 was 
improper due to OC6’s refusal to accept the shipment.   
        
              5.      Discovery of Accounting Irregularities and Restatement of Revenue  
 
       On December 17, 2002, an $80,000 reduction of f ourth quarter 2002 revenue titled “price 
protection adjustment” appeared for the first time on an internal Microtune report generated by the 
customer service department to track quarterly sales.  The $80,000 line item was based on a credit 
requested by OC2 for price protection.   When   Microtune’s new CFO learned about the price 
protection adjustment, she immediately asked the accounting and customer service departments to 
determine Microtune’s total price protection exposure.  She also immediately raised the issue with 
the CEO, Housley, and Davis.   Housley and Davi  s reviewed the price protection analysis and 
determined that the exposure on OC2 and OC3 was $517,000.  The new CFO drafted two settlement 
agreements in which Microtune agreed to issue a $195,000 credit to OC2 and a $322,000 credit to 
OC3 to resolve all price protection issues.  The settlement agreements were executed on December 
31, 2002. 
        
       During a January 2003 meeting with the auditors to discuss the upcoming 2002 audit, the 
new CFO asked the auditors for guidance on the recording of the price protection credits issued to 
OC2 and OC3 pursuant to the settlement agreements. The auditors told the new CFO that because 
the settlements resolved price protection issues,  the settlement amounts should be recorded as a 
reduction of revenue.  The auditors also told the new CFO that because the price protection amounts 
were material, Microtune faced the possibility of restating its 2002 quarterly financial statements for 
the quarters which included revenues from sales with price protection.  Shortly after learning about 
the restatement possibility, the CEO, Housley, the new CFO, and the new controller, met with the 
auditors to discuss price protection and possible restatement. 
 
                                              11
 
---------------------Page 12---------------------

         
        The auditors ultimately concluded that the   settlement amounts should be recorded as a 
reduction of revenue and that a revenue restatement was necessary.  Soon thereafter, the auditors 
reported their findings to Microtune’s audit co       mmittee, which hired independent counsel to 
investigate the events that led to the reduction  of revenue.  Eventually, through the independent 
counsel’s investigation, the full scope of the scheme was revealed. 
         
                6.      The Fraud Materially Impacted Microtune’s Financial Results  
          
                        a. Revenue Misstatements            
         
        Securities analysts covering Microtune in <date.>2001</> and <date.>2002</> considered revenue, rather than net 
income, the key indicator for gauging Microtune’s performance.  This is because Microtune, as a 
fledgling public company, was sustaining considerable losses.     11
                                                                      As a result of the concealed sales 
concessions, Microtune overstated its <item.>revenue</> from between 5 percent to 77 percent per quarter, 
beginning in the third quarter of 2001.  The following table shows the impact of the misstatements 
on Microtune’s revenues as originally reported in Microtune’s financial statements for the second, 
third and fourth quarters of 2001, audited financial statements for the year ended 2001, and financial 
statements for the first, second and third quarters of 2002.12

        For example, Microtune’s 2001 net loss was restated from ($64.2 million) to ($67.4 million).  For the first three 
quarters of 2002, Microtune’s total net loss was restated from an aggregate of ($44.3 million) to an aggregate of ($48.6 
million).  Microtune’s total 2002 net loss was ($182.8 million).

        Microtune did not report fourth quarter 2002 <item.>revenue</> results other than preliminary results, which were later 
revised, in a February 20, 2003 press release and a related Form 8-K.  At the time of the February 2003 press release, the 
internal investigative team had not yet uncovered the full scope of the scheme.  In the financial statement filed with the                                         
Commission for the second quarter of 2004, Microtune reported quarterly revenue of $13.5 million. 
 
13 
        For purposes of this chart, the staff calculated Microtune’s 2001 annual forecasted revenue by totaling the 2001 
quarterly revenue forecasts.

       In mid-2001, before the commencement of the revenue-inflation scheme, Microtune’s stock 
generally traded in the $10-15 per share range.   The share price spiked to over $18 on the day 
Microtune announced its third quarter 2001 results – the first of the periods Microtune ultimately 
restated.  Microtune’s stock price peaked at $29.28 per share on January 3, 2002, in the midst of the 
scheme.  After that, however, the price of Microtune’s stock began to decline.  The combination of 
the weakening economy, particularly in the high-tech sector, and Microtune’s inability to meet its 
projections in the second half of 2002 – despite        the scheme – deflated its stock price to 
approximately $3 per share by year-end.  Finall y, on February 21, 2003, the day after Microtune 
announced “material negative charges” for the f ourth quarter of 2002 and the beginning of the 
independent counsel’s inquiry, its stock dropped 36 percent to a low of $1.19 per share.   
 
        C. LEGAL ANALYSIS              
 
        1.             Antifraud Violations       
        
       Section 17(a) of the Securities Act prohib its employing a fraudulent scheme or making 
material misrepresentations and omissions in the offer or sale of a security. 14
                                                                                  Section 10(b) of the 
Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder prohibit the same conduct, if committed in connection 
with the purchase or sale of securities.  To violate these provisions, the alleged misrepresentations or 
omitted facts must be material.  Information is material if it would have assumed significance in the 
investment deliberations of a reasonable investor.  Basic, Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224 (1988). 
        
       Microtune filed materially false financial statements in its 2001 Form 10-K and its Forms 
10-Q for the third quarter of 2001 and the second and third quarters of 2002.   15
                                                                                    The misstatements 
were material because they falsely inflated Microtune’s quarterly revenue by at least 5 percent and 
as much as 77 percent in one quarter as a result of improper revenue recognition.   
        
       Establishing violations of Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the 
Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 requires a showing of scienter.  Aaron v. SEC, 446 U.S. 680 (1980).  
However, actions under Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(  a)(3) of the Securities Act require no such 
showing.  Id.    Scienter is the “mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate or defraud.”   
Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185, 193 (1976). Scienter is established by showing that the 
defendants acted intentionally or with severe recklessness.  See  Broad v. Rockwell International 
Corp., 642 F.2d 929 (5th Cir.) (en banc), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 965 (1981).  The scienter of high-
level corporate officers may be imputed to the company.  SEC v. Manor Nursing Centers, 458 F.2d 
1082, 1094 (2d Cir. 1971). 
 
                                                                                                                                                             
14 
       Because Microtune offered and sold quantities of its securities in a registered offering during December 2001, 
Microtune’s misrepresentations were committed in the offer and sale of securities in violation of Section 17(a).        
Specifically, Microtune conducted a $109 million stock offering pursuant to Form S-3,  commencing in the fourth quarter 
of 2001, incorporating by reference Microtune’s Form 10   -Q for the period ended September 30, 2001, which contained 
materially overstated revenue. 
 
15 
       Microtune restated its first quarter 2002 revenue; however, the company’s restated revenue of $18,264,000 was 
not materially different from its originally reported revenue of $18,243,000. 
 
                                                  13
 
---------------------Page 14---------------------

       Housley acted with scienter as evidenced by his direct involvement in numerous revenue-
inflating transactions, and his intentional concealment of sales concessions from Microtune’s 
customer service and accounting departments and auditors.  In many cases, Housley personally 
granted sales concessions to customers and distributors even after the Microtune controller notified 
him that concessions could preclude revenue recognition.  The transaction most clearly evidencing 
Housley’s scienter is the side agreement he struck with OC5, which paved the way for a $1.4 million 
sale.   Housley concealed the existence of th e OC5 side agreement by executing and faxing the 
agreement from his home, and he failed to produce it when Microtune’s accounting department 
sought Housley’s aid in collecting past due accounts receivable from OC5.  The scienter of Housley 
is imputed to Microtune.  Therefore, Microtune and Housley violated the antifraud provisions of the 
Securities Act and Exchange Act. 
        
       Davis caused Microtune’s fraud.  He granted  sales concessions to Microtune’s customers 
and distributors, and then failed to inform Micr otune’s accounting department and auditors about 
these sales concessions.  As a result, Microtune materially inflated its published revenue.   
 
              2.      Reporting Violations  
 
       Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act requires issuers such as Microtune to file periodic reports 
with the Commission containing such information as the Commission prescribes by rule.  Exchange 
Act Rule 13a-1 requires issuers to file annual   reports, and Exchange Act Rule 13a-13 requires 
issuers to file quarterly reports.  Under Excha nge Act Rule 12b-20, the reports must contain, in 
addition to disclosures expressly required by statute and rules, such other information as is necessary 
to ensure that the statements made are not, unde r the circumstances, materially misleading.  The 
obligation to file reports includes the requirement that the reports be true and correct.  United States 
v. Bilzerian, 926 F.2d 1285, 1298 (2d. Cir.),  cert. denied, 502 U.S. 813 (1991).   The reporting 
provisions are violated if false and misleading reports are filed.  SEC v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., 629 
F.2d 62, 67 (D.C. Cir. 1980).  No showing of scienter is necessary to establish a violation of Section 
13(a) or of Rules 13a-1, 13a-13, a nd 12b-20 promulgated thereunder.  SEC v. McNulty, 137 F.3d 
732, 740-41 (2d Cir. 1998); SEC v. Wills, 472 F. Supp. 1250, 1268 (D.D.C. 1978);  see also In re 
Signal Technology Corp., Exchange Act Release N o. 45655, 2002 WL 461340, at *6 (Mar. 27, 
2002); In re Curtis L. Dally, Exchange Act Release No. 39144, 1997 WL 598007, at *4 (Sept. 29, 
1997); In re TCF Fin. Corp., Exchange Act Release No. 36084, 1994 WL 838074, at *5 n.9 (Aug. 
10, 1994). 
 
       As a result of the fraud, facilitated by Microtune’s internal controls deficiencies, Microtune 
filed materially false and misleading periodic reports with the Commission.  Microtune’s 2001 Form  
10-K and its Forms 10-Q for the third quarter  of 2001 and the second and third quarters of 2002 
materially overstated Microtune’s revenue for those periods.  Microtune therefore violated Section 
13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1, 13a-13, and 12b-20 thereunder. 
 
       Rogers prepared and signed Microtune’s Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2001 and the 
2001 Form 10-K.  By failing to establish controls necessary for Microtune to ensure the accurate 
reporting of its financial results, Rogers caused Microtune’s reporting violations.  Housley caused 
Microtune’s reporting violations by granting sale  s concessions to customers and distributors, 
 
                                               14
 
---------------------Page 15---------------------

including through an undisclosed side agreement,  that he knew or should have known could 
preclude revenue recognition and by failing to disclose certain concessions to Microtune’s customer 
service and accounting departments and to its outside auditors.  Davis caused Microtune’s reporting 
violations by granting sales concessions to cust omers and distributors and by failing to inform   
Microtune’s accounting department and auditors about these sales concessions. 
        
              3.      Books and Records and Internal Controls Violations  
 
       Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act requires issuers to make and keep books, records, 
and accounts that, in reasonable detail, accurately   and fairly reflect transactions and asset 
dispositions.  Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act requires issuers to devise and maintain a 
system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that transactions 
are recorded as necessary to permit the prepara  tion of financial statements in accordance with 
GAAP.  Scienter and materiality are not elements of a violation of either provision.  United States v. 
Crop Growers Corp., 954 F. Supp. 335 (D.D.C. 1997); SEC v. World-Wide Coin Inv., Ltd., 567 F. 
Supp. 724, 749-50 (N.D. Ga. 1983).  In addition, Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act provides that 
no person shall knowingly circumvent or knowingl     y fail to implement a system of internal 
accounting controls or knowingly falsify certa  in books, records and accounts.  Rule 13b2-1 
thereunder provides that no person shall falsify or cause to be falsified any book, record or account.  
  
       Microtune violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) by failing to keep books, records and accounts that 
accurately and fairly reflected its financial results.  Microtune violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) by failing 
to devise and maintain a system of internal controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that 
revenues were recorded as necessary to permit prep aration of financial statements in conformity 
with GAAP.  Microtune violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) for the additional reason that it lacked controls 
that would reasonably have prevented or at least detected the improper sales concessions and side 
agreements giving rise to Microtune’s violations.   
        
       Housley, Rogers and Davis caused Microtune’s violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 
13(b)(2)(B).   Rogers, as Microtune’s CFO and therefore, the individual chiefly responsible for 
establishing the company’s internal controls, failed to develop and implement the controls necessary 
to record accurately the revenue from sales.  Housley and Davis were responsible for Microtune’s 
improperly allowing the recording of sales revenue.  In addition, Housley and Davis, through their 
supervision of the customer service department, failed to ensure that the department provided 
evidence of sales concessions to Microtune’s accounting department. 
 
       Housley also violated Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1.  By causing 
Microtune to record revenue improperly base  d upon undisclosed sales concessions and side 
agreements, Housley knowingly circumvented Microtune’s internal controls and caused, directly or 
indirectly, Microtune to falsify its books, records or accounts.

---------------------Page 16---------------------

              4. 	    Housley’s False Statements and Failure to Disclose 
                      Material Information to the Company’s Accountants and Auditors  
               
       Rule 13b2-2 under Section 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act prohibits any director or officer of 
an issuer from making a false or misleading statement to an accountant, or omitting to state a 
material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under 
which they were made, not misleading, in connection with any audit required under the Exchange 
Act or the preparation of any document required  to be filed with the Commission.  The test for 
materiality under Rule 13b2-2 is whether the misstatement had the potential of keeping the auditors 
from discovering a false book or record.  Exchange Act Rel. No. 15570 (Feb. 15, 1979). Scienter is 
not an element of this offense.  World-Wide Coin, 567 F. Supp. at 749-50. 
        
       In October 2002, Housley signed a management representation letter to Microtune’s outside 
auditors falsely stating that: 1) collectibility of accounts receivable from distributors is not dependent 
on the ultimate sale to end customers; 2) all sales terms, including all rights of return, have been 
disclosed; and 3) there were no side agreements.  In fact, Housley granted “flexible” payment terms 
and rights of return to customers and distributors and entered into a secret side agreement with OC5. 
 Thus, Housley knew the management representation letter to the auditors was false and misleading. 
Therefore, Housley violated Rule 13b2-2.  
         
                                              IV. 

                                        VIOLATIONS
  
 
       The Commission finds that: 
 
       A.     Microtune violated Section 17(a) of th e Securities Act, and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 
13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange  Act, and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 
thereunder; 
 
       B.     Housley violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) 
of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 a  nd 13b2-2 thereunder, and caused Microtune’s 
violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 
13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder;   further, Housle y has submitted a sworn Statement of Financial 
Condition dated March 14, 2005 and other eviden      ce and has asserted his inability to pay 
disgorgement plus prejudgment interest. 
 
       C.     Davis caused Microtune’s violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, and 
Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 
13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder; and 
 
       D.     Rogers caused Microtune’s violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) 
of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.

                                               V. 

                                                 
       In view of the foregoing, the Commission d eems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in the Respondents’ Offers. 
 
       Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act and 
Section 21C of the Exchange Act, that: 
 
       A.       Respondent Microtune cease and desist from committing or causing any violation 
and any future violation of Section 17(a) of     the Securities Act, and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 
13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange  Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 
thereunder; 
 
       B. 	    Respondent Housley 
 
               1. 	   cease and desist from committing or causing any violation and any future 
                      violation of Section 17(a) of the S  ecurities Act, and Sections 10(b) and 
                      13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 
                      thereunder, and from causing any viol  ation and any future violation of 
                      Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 
                      12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder; 
                       
               2.	    pay disgorgement of $288,000 plus prejudgment interest, but that payment 
                      of all but $50,000 is waived, based upon  Housley’s sworn representations 
                      in his Statement of Financial C ondition dated March 14, 2005 and other 
                      documents submitted to the Commission;  provided, that the Division of   
                      Enforcement (“Division”) may, at a  ny time following the entry of this 
                      Order, petition the Commission to: (1) reopen this matter to consider 
                      whether Housley provided accurate and complete financial information at 
                      the time such representations were made; and (2) seek an order directing 
                      payment of disgorgement and pre-judgm ent interest.  No other issue shall 
                      be considered in connection with this petition other than whether the 
                      financial information provided by H  ousley was fraudulent, misleading, 
                      inaccurate, or incomplete in any ma  terial respect. Housley may not, by 
                      way of defense to any such petition: (1 ) contest the findings in this Order; 
                      (2) assert that payment of disgor    gement and interest should not be 
                      ordered; (3) contest the amount of      disgorgement and interest to be 
                      ordered; and (4) assert any defense to liability or remedy, including, but        
                      not limited to, any statute of limitations defense;  
               3. 	   pay the total amount of $50,000 to the United States Treasury as follows: 
                      (1) a $5,000 initial payment to be paid pr ior to or within ten days of the 
                      entry of the Order; (2) the remaining  $45,000 to be paid in installments of 
                      $7,500 every six months, beginning no la  ter than six months from the 
                      entry of the Order, over a 36-month period or until paid in full; and (3) the

                        final payment must be made no late r than 36 months following the entry 
                        of the Order.  Such payment shall  be: (A) made by United States postal
