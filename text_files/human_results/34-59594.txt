                                               III.  
 
       On the basis of this Order and Respondents’ Offers, the Commission finds 1
                                                                                  that: 
                                           Summary  

       1.       This matter concerns Allion’s failure to properly record and report two significant 
warrant grants made during <date.>the second quarter of 2005</>.  Because Allion failed to recognize interest 
expense for the warrants in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), 
the company materially overstated its <item.>net income</> and understated its <item.>loss per share</> when reporting 
results for the second quarter of 2005 and the  nine months ended September 30, 2005.  Allion 
restated its results in March 2006 after the company’s independent auditor inquired about the 
errors.  In its restatement, the company reduced its net income by 1372% for the second quarter of 
2005, from net income of $70,431 to a net loss of $895,569, and increased its loss per share for this 
period by 77%, from $0.31 to $0.55 per share.  Allion also reduced its net income for the nine 
months ended September 30, 2005 by 97%, from $932,517 to $26,517, and increased its loss per 
share for this period by 233%, from $0.06 to $0.20 per share.  Allion violated the federal securities 
laws by filing materially inaccurate periodic reports with the Commission, failing to make and 
keep accurate books and records, and failing to devise and maintain an adequate system of  
accounting controls. 
       2.       Allion’s former chief financial officer, James G. Spencer, was a cause of the 
company’s violations and certified the company’s inaccurate Form 10-Qs for the second and third 
quarters of 2005.  Spencer knew the warrants had potentially significant value, and was aware of 
the potential impact on the company’s earnings associated with the larger of the two grants.  
Nevertheless, he failed to ensure that the company properly recorded and reported the warrant 
transactions. 
                                          Respondents  

       3.       Allion, a Delaware corporation with its headquarters in Melville, New York, is a 
national provider of specialty pharmacy and disease management services focused on HIV/AIDS 
patients.  During all relevant times, Allion’s common stock has been registered with the  
Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and traded on the NASDAQ National  
Market under the symbol “ALLI.” 
       4.       Spencer, 40, a resident of Baltimore, Maryland, served as Allion’s chief financial 
officer (“CFO”) from May 2004 to July 2007.  Spencer worked for Allion as an independent 
consultant for approximately seven months before becoming CFO.  Since  July 2007, Spencer has  
been senior vice president and CFO for a privately-held company.  Spencer has never been a 
certified public accountant (“CPA”).

                     Director’s Personal Guarantee of Allion’s Line of Credit  
       5.       In late 1999 or early 2000, an Allion director agreed to personally guarantee a $1.5 
million line of credit for Allion and Allion granted the director a warrant to purchase 375,000

  The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondents’  Offers of Settlement and are not binding on any other  
person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

shares of common stock as consideration for his guarantee.  The warrant expires in March 2010 
and the shares are exercisable at $1.00 per share.  In June 2002, Allion issued another warrant to 
purchase 150,000 shares of common stock to the director as consideration for extending his 
guarantee of the loan.  This warrant had a ten year life and an exercise price of $3.50 per share.2 
                                                                                                     
Allion issued these warrants prior to the time Spencer began working at the company. 
                           Allion’s Second Quarter 2005 Warrant Grants  
       6.       Allion’s line of credit was due to expire in March 2005, by which time the company 
was preparing to file a registration statement for its initial public offering (“IPO”).  Because Allion 
did not have sufficient cash available to repay the line of credit, it needed to extend it to continue  
operating until the company could raise funds through the IPO.  The bank that had issued the line 
of credit agreed to extend it for six months contingent upon, among other things, the director 
maintaining his personal guarantee. 
       7.       The director asked Allion for a warrant to purchase additional shares of Allion 
stock in return for extending his guarantee.  Allion’s board had  numerous discussions regarding the 
value of the warrant grant.  During these discussions, Spencer told Allion’s chief executive officer 
(“CEO”) and two members of the board that the estimated value of  such a warrant grant would be 
$1.75 to $2 per share, based on the calculations performed by an independent valuation firm that  
Allion had used when valuing warrants issued in connection with two acquisitions it made during 
early 2005. 
       8.       On April 13, 2005, Allion’s board of directors held a special meeting to grant the 
director a warrant to purchase 100,000 shares of Allion common stock at an exercise price equal to  
the IPO price or, if no IPO were to occur by April 20, 2006, at  $6.26 per share (the “Director 
Warrant”).  As anticipated at the time the Director Warrant was granted, Allion publicly filed its 
registration statement for the IPO with the Commission two days later, and the IPO took place 
approximately two months later at a price of $13 per share.  Conseq   uently, the exercise price of the 
Director Warrant became $13 per share.  The Director Warrant      has never been exercised, and 
expires on April 15, 2015. 
       9.       During the evening of April 14, Spencer received an e-mail from an assistant to the 
director who had been granted the Director Warrant, asking “what is earnings hit for these 
warrants??”  Spencer replied that the value of warrants recently issued by the company in 
connection with a March 2005 acquisition had been approximately $1.65 per share; however, he  
also noted that if the company were to go public there was a “good chance” the company’s auditor 
would want to reassess the volatility factor used in the Black-Scholes model.  3

  At the time of the grants, Allion recognized an insufficient expense for the 2000 grant and disclosed, but did not           
recognize any expense for, the 2002 grant.  In 2006, Allion calculated the expense for these grants and determined                                             
the associated increases were immaterial  when recognized over the term of the loan.  The director exercised the  
2002 warrant and sold the shares at $12.83  in Allion’s January 2006 secondary offering.

  Although GAAP does not require its use, the Black-Scholes model is commonly used to estimate the fair value of   
stock options and other equity instruments, including warrants.  The inputs to the Black-Scholes model include: (a)                   
the exercise price of the warrant; (b) the expected life of the warrant; (c) the current price of the underlying stock;  
(d) its expected volatility; (e) expected dividends; and (f) th   e risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the  
warrant.

       10.     In response, the director’s assistant asked Spencer for a Black-Scholes model to 
estimate the value of the Director Warrant.  Later that evening, Spencer e-mailed the assistant and 
Allion’s CEO the results of his Black-Scholes model, which showed that a ten-year warrant with 
an exercise price of $10 would be valued at $3.74 per share and a ten-year warrant with an exercise 
price of $12 would be valued at $4.49 per share.4
                                                  The valuations produced by Spencer’s model 
were higher than the estimates he previously had communicated to Allion’s CEO and two directors 
during the board of directors’ discussions regarding the grant.  Furthermore, Spencer did not  
consult the company’s auditor or the independent valuation firm Allion previously had used 
regarding the correct volatility factor or any other aspect of the Black-Scholes model he used to 
produce these valuations. 
       11.     Allion disclosed the issuance of the Director Warrant in its IPO registration 
statement filed with the Commission on April 15, 2005.  A few days later, on April 21, Allion 
again disclosed the issuance of the Director Warrant in a Form 8-K filing that attached the warrant 
agreement as an exhibit.  Also on April 21, the director himself filed a Form 4 disclosing his  
receipt of the Director Warrant. 
       12.     In mid-May 2005, Allion issued a $2 million note to an investor.  As partial 
consideration for the note, Allion granted the investor a warrant to purchase 40,000 shares of 
Allion common stock at an exercise price equal to the price per share of a successful IPO (the 
“Investor Warrant”), which as noted above turned out to be $13.00 per share.  The Investor 
Warrant has never been exercised, and expires  on May 15, 2010. 
       13.     On May 18, 2005, Allion disclosed the issuance of the Investor Warrant in its Form  
10-Q for the first quarter of 2005, and attached the warrant agreement as an exhibit to that filing.  
Allion also disclosed the issuance of the Director Warrant in the same Form 10-Q. 
                                   Allion’s June 22, 2005 IPO  
       14.     On June 22, 2005, Allion conducted its IPO, selling four million shares of common 
stock at $13 per share.  Allion disclosed the issuance of the Director and Investor Warrants in its  
registration statements and prospectus for the IPO.  Allion used proceeds from the offering to repay 
the bank line of credit and the $2 million note prior to June 30, 2005.   
                         Allion Failed to Properly Record and Report the  

                 Director and Investor Warrants in its Second Quarter Form 10-Q
  
       15.     GAAP provides that when a company grants warrants in connection with the 
issuance of debt, it should value the warrants and generally record a non-cash interest expense for 
these warrants over the life of the debt.  Allion, however, failed to record any expense for the 
Director or Investor Warrants in its  Form 10-Q for the second quarter of 2005. 
       16.     Neither the Director Warrant nor the Investor Warrant was properly recorded in the 
company’s books and records for the second quarter of 2005.  At the time, Allion had no written 
procedures in place for recording equity-based transactions.  As CFO, Spencer was responsible for 
ensuring that the warrants were properly recorded in Allion’s financial statements, yet failed to do 
so.  Spencer did not verify that the warrants were recorded in the company’s accounting records, 
nor did he provide his valuation model to anyone else to enable  them to properly record the 

                                                 
4
  Spencer’s Black-Scholes models assumed the exercise price of the warrant equaled the market price of Allion’s 
common stock, which Spencer’s models assumed would be the IPO price per share.

expense.  In addition, notwithstanding his lack of experience  accounting for equity issued in 
connection with debt, Spencer did not consult  with the company’s auditor, other accountants, or 
any other specialist regarding how properly to value or record the Director or Investor Warrants. 
       17.     Allion was scheduled to release its second quarter results and host an investor 
conference call after the market closed on August 11, 2005.  Prior to that  date and after reviewing 
the Investor Warrant disclosure in the company’s draft Form 10-Q, Allion’s auditor had asked 
Spencer whether an expense for the Investor Warrant had been recorded in the company’s financial 
statements.  On the morning of August 11, Spencer informed the auditor that the company had not 
recorded an expense for the Investor Warrant.  One of the auditors responded by e-mail that “if 
there was no accounting for these warrants, which there should have been, we just need to know 
what was/should be the value attached to those warrants.”   
       18.     Spencer subsequently used the Black-Scholes model and valued the Investor 
Warrant at $60,000.  He e-mailed the model to the auditor early in the afternoon on August 11.  
However, Spencer’s calculation underestimated the fair value of the Investor Warrant by more than  
$150,000 because he incorrectly used an estimated term of exercise that was only half of the 
warrant’s life, rather than the full term, and he used a stock price volatility that was too low 
because it did not reflect the increased volatility of Allion’s stock price after the stock became 
publicly traded. 
       19.     Later that day, Allion’s auditor advised the chairman of the company’s Audit 
Committee and Spencer that it was proposing an adjustment of $60,000 to the company’s second 
quarter interest expense, an amount the auditor and the company collectively deemed to be 
immaterial to the second quarter results.  Allion recorded the $60,000 interest expense in its third 
quarter financial statements. 
       20.     Notwithstanding his multiple communications regarding the accounting for the 
Investor Warrant, Spencer did not alert Allion’s auditor to the possibility that the company 
similarly might have failed to recognize an expense for the much larger Director Warrant grant. 
       21.     Allion’s second quarter Form 10-Q, which was certified by Spencer and filed on 
August 15, 2005, included financial statements that were materially incorrect because they did not  
reflect any interest expense for the Director Warrant or Investor Warrant. 
         Allion Failed to Properly Record and Report  the Director or Investor Warrants in  

  Its Form 10-Q for the Third Quarter of 2005 and January 2006 Secondary Offering Documents
  
       22.     Allion’s third quarter Form 10-Q, which was filed on November 14, 2005 and 
certified by Spencer, included financial statements that materially overstated Allion’s net income 
and earnings per share for the first nine months of 2005 because they understated the interest 
expense for the Investor Warrant and did not reflect any interest expense for the Director Warrant.5 
                                                                                                   
       23.     Allion conducted a follow-on offering of common stock on January 26, 2006.  The 
company sold 1.8 million shares and selling stockholders sold an additional 2,636,454 shares at 
$12.83 per share.  The company’s registration statements and final prospectus for the offering 
included the company’s financial results through the first nine months of 2005, and thus contained 
the same warrant-related inaccuracies as the third quarter Form 10-Q described above.  These  

                                                 
5
  As noted above, Allion recorded $60,000 of interest expe                  nse for the Investor Warrant in its third quarter financial   
statements.

filings, however, did contain disclosures concerning the issuance of the Director Warrant and 
Investor Warrant. 
                               Allion’s March 2006 Restatement  
       24.     Allion was scheduled to release its 2005 annual results and conduct an earnings call 
after the market closed on March 9, 2006.  On March 8, Allion’s auditor, after reviewing the 
disclosure regarding the Director Warrant grant in the draft Form 10-K, asked Spencer whether the 
company had recognized an expense for that warrant.  After checking the company’s accounting 
books and records, Spencer informed the auditor that Allion had not recorded an expense for the  
Director Warrant, and Spencer and the auditor agreed that the company needed to do so.  Spencer 
then prepared a Black-Scholes model valuing the Director Warrant at approximately $150,000.  
Allion’s auditor, however, independently prepared  a Black-Scholes model that valued the Director 
Warrant at approximately $700,000 - $900,000. 
       25.     The discrepancy prompted Allion’s auditor to review Spencer’s Black-Scholes 
calculation.  Based on this review, the auditor determined that Spencer incorrectly had used an 
expected term of half of the Director Warrant’s life, rather than the full life, and used a volatility 
factor that was too low. 
       26.     Following the market close on March 9, Allion filed a Form 8-K and issued a 
related press release announcing its intention to restate results for the three and six months ended 
June 30, 2005 and the nine months ended September 30, 2005 to correct the failure to record a 
non-cash interest expense for the Director Warrant.  The press release stated that Allion expected 
the non-cash interest expense to be approximately $700,000 - $900,000 recorded in the second 
quarter of 2005.  Prior to issuing its press release, Allion self-reported the matter to the  
Commission staff. 
       27.     The following day, Allion’s auditor sent an e-mail to Spencer questioning whether 
the company had “the same issues” with respect to its accounting for the Investor Warrant.  
Spencer subsequently recalculated the fair value of both the Director and Investor Warrant.  Based 
on advice from Allion’s auditor and an independent valuation expert, Spencer used the full 
contractual term of the warrants as the expected term of exercise and a volatility factor of 40%, 
which was based on the closing prices of Allion’s stock and other health care companies’ stocks  
during the eight and a half months since Allion’s June 2005 IPO.  Using these revised inputs to the  
Black-Scholes model, Spencer valued the Director Warrant at $752,563 and the Investor Warrant 
at $213,747.

       28.     On March 15, Allion filed a Form 8-K disclosing its prior failure to record the 
correct non-cash interest expense for the Investor Warrant and stating that the total non-cash 
interest expense to be recorded in the second quarter of 2005 for both warrants would be restated to 
$966,000.  The effect of the restatement is summarized in the charts below:

              Allion Stated that a Material Weakness Existed in its Internal Controls  
       29.     Allion’s 2005 Form 10-K, filed on March 16, 2006, stated that, after consultation 
with its auditor, the company’s management had concluded that a material weakness existed in the 
company’s internal controls over financial reporting relating to its failure to properly record non-
cash interest expense for the Director Warrant and Investor Warrant.   
       30.     Allion has since taken steps to address this material weakness, including retaining 
an independent consultant to review and improve its internal procedures and controls relating to the  
recording of equity-based and related party transactions, adding two certified public accountants to 
its board of directors and audit committee, one of whom was appointed     chairman of the audit 
committee and later became the company’s CFO after Spencer voluntarily left Allion in July 2007.  
The company also sent its controller for additional training.  
         Spencer was Responsible for Allion’s Improper Accounting and Internal Controls  
       31.     Spencer, as CFO, was responsible for  Allion’s false financial statements and 
inadequate internal controls described above.  Spencer knew that the Director Warrant had 
potentially significant value, and was aware of the potential “earnings hit” associated with the 
warrant.  Nevertheless, he failed to ensure that the Director or Investor Warrants were recorded 
                                                 
6 
  Allion’s restated interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 was $60,000 less than its  
restated interest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2005 because the company recognized $60,000 of   
interest expense for the Investor Warrant in its Form 10-Q originally filed for the third quarter of 2005.

properly in the company’s accounting records.  He did not verify that the warrants were recorded, 
nor did he provide his valuation model to anyone else to enable  them to properly record the 
expense.  In addition, notwithstanding his lack of experience  accounting for equity issued in 
connection with debt, Spencer did not consult with the company’s auditor, other accountants, or 
any other specialist regarding how properly to value or record the Director or Investor Warrants.  
Instead, Spencer unreasonably relied upon Allion’s auditor to detect and remedy the company’s 
accounting errors.  Even after the company’s auditor inquired about the omission of the Investor  
Warrant from the company’s financial statements shortly before Allion filed its second quarter 
Form 10-Q, Spencer failed to inquire whether the company’s accounting for the Director Warrant 
raised a similar issue or raise the issue with the auditor. 
      Spencer Made Inaccurate Certifications Under Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act  
       32.     As Allion’s CFO, Spencer signed certifications for Allion’s  Forms 10-Q for the 
second and third quarters of 2005 stating that, among other things, he had evaluated the 
effectiveness of the company’s internal controls over financial reporting, and had disclosed to the 
company’s auditor and audit committee all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the 
design or operation of these internal controls.  Spencer should have known that the company’s 
internal controls relating to the recording of warrant transactions were deficient, and that these 
certifications therefore were inaccurate. 
                                           Violations  

       33.     Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13a-13 thereunder require issuers with 
securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act to file quarterly reports with the 
Commission.  Exchange Act Rule 12b-20 requires that an issuer’s periodic reports contain such  
further material information as may be necessary to ensure that the required statements made in 
them are not misleading.  It is implicit in these  requirements that the information in the reports be 
accurate. See SEC v. IMC International, Inc.                               , 384 F. Supp. 889, 893 (N.D. Texas), aff’d mem., 
505 F.2d 733 (5th Cir. 1974), cert. denied sub nom., Evans v. SEC, 420 U.S. 930 (1975). 
       34.     Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act requires issuers to “make and keep books, 
records, and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and 
dispositions of the assets of the issuer.”  Section 13(b)(2)(B) of  the Exchange Act requires issuers 
to devise and maintain a system of internal controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances 
that, among other things, transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial 
statements in conformity with GAAP. 
       35.     Exchange Act Rule 13a-14 requires principal executive and financial officers to 
certify in quarterly Commission filings that, among other things, the certifying officers have 
reviewed the filing and, based on their most recent evaluation of the company’s internal controls 
over financial reporting, have disclosed to the audit committee and auditors all significant 
deficiencies and material weaknesses in these internal controls. 
       36.     As a result of the conduct described above, Allion violated Sections 13(a),  
13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange  Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder. 
       37.     As a result of the conduct described above, Spencer was a cause of Allion’s 
violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 
and 13a-13 thereunder, and violated Exchange Act Rule 13a-14.

                                       Allion’s Remedial Efforts  

        38.      In determining to accept the Offers, the Commission considered remedial acts 
undertaken by Allion and cooperation afforded the Commission staff                                     .

        In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the cease-and-
desist order agreed to in Respondents’ Offers. 
 
        Accordingly, it is hereby  ORDERED that:  
 
                    A. Pursuant to Section 21C  of the Exchange Act, Respondent Allion cease and desist  
from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 
and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder; and 
 
                    B. Pursuant to Section 21C  of the Exchange Act, Respondent Spencer cease and desist  
from causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 
13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder, and cease and desist 
from committing or causing any violation and any future violation of Exchange Act Rule 13a-14. 
 
 By the Commission.
