                                                  I. 
 
       The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in 
the public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against 
John (“Jack”) J. Egan, Jr. (“Respondent” or “Egan”) pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(i) of the 
                                  1
Commission’s Rules of Practice.     
        
                                                  II. 
 
       In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the “Offer”), which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the 
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the 

                                                           
1
   Rule 102(e)(3)(i) provides, in relevant part, that: 
 
       The Commission, with due regard to the public interest and without preliminary hearing, may, by order, . . . 
suspend from appearing or practicing before it any . . . accountant . . . who has been by name . . . permanently 
enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction, by reason of his or her misconduct in an action brought by the 
Commission, from violating or aiding and abetting the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or of 
the rules and regulations thereunder.

findings herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of 
these proceedings, and the findings contained in Section III. C. below, which are admitted, 
Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant 
to Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial 
Sanctions (“Order”), as set forth below. 
        
                                              III. 
                                                 
       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that: 
 
       A.     John (“Jack”) J. Egan, Jr. (“Respondent” or “Egan”), C.P.A. (New York, 
inactive), age 64, was Chief Financial Officer, Principal Financial Officer, and Senior Vice 
President of <comp.>Volt Information Sciences, Inc.</> (“Volt” or “the Company”) from at least 2006 to 
August 10, 2011.  Effective August 10, 2011, he became Volt’s Senior Vice President of Global 
Planning and Budgeting.  Volt terminated Egan in February 2012.  Egan is currently retired. 
        
       B.     Volt is a New York corporation with its principal executive offices located in 
New York, New York.  Its common stock, previously registered under Section 12(b) of the 
Exchange Act, traded on the New York Stock Exchange (symbol VOL) until it was de-listed on 
May 9, 2011, for the Company’s failure to file periodic reports with the Commission.  Volt now 
trades in the Over-the-Counter market (OTC symbol VISI).  Volt provides services relating to 
staffing, telecommunications, computer systems, and printing through four corresponding 
business units. 
        
       C.     On July 18, 2014, a final judgment was entered against Egan, permanently 
enjoining him from violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 
13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), and Exchange Act Rules 
10b-5(a), 10b-5(b), 10b-5(c),13b2-1, 13b2-2, and 13a-14; and from aiding and abetting 
violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange 
Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-11 thereunder, in the civil action entitled Securities and 
Exchange Commission v. Jack J. Egan, Jr., C.P.A., Civil Action No. 13-CV-236 (S.D.N.Y.) 
(January 10, 2013) .  The Court also barred Egan from serving as an officer or director of any 
issuer that has a class of securities registered with the Commission or that is required to file 
reports with the Commission, and ordered him to pay a $35,000 civil money penalty. 
        
       D.     The Commission’s Complaint alleges that for Volt’s fiscal year ended <date.>October 28, 
2007</>, Volt’s computer-segment subsidiary recognized fraudulent <item.>revenue</> based on a purported 
completion and sale of two of four software modules that constituted the core of a new directory 
assistance system for a significant telecommunications customer.  The Complaint further alleges 
that Egan, a certified public accountant, Volt’s Chief Financial Officer, and Volt’s Principal 
Financial Officer, knew or was reckless in not knowing that recognition of the fraudulent 
revenue did not comply with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles; and that nevertheless, 

                                               2

he signed Volt’s public filings that included the revenue in Volt’s financial statements for the 
Company’s fourth-quarter and fiscal year ended October 28, 2007.  The Complaint also alleges 
that Egan, as Volt’s Principal Financial Officer, certified Volt’s Annual Reports on Forms 10-K 
for the Company’s fiscal years ended 2007 and 2008, when he knew or was reckless in not 
knowing that the financial statements were materially false and misleading.  
        
                                              IV. 
                                                 
       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest 
to impose the sanction agreed to in Respondent Egan’s Offer. 
                                                 
       Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, effective immediately, that Egan is suspended 
from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant. 
 
 
       By the Commission.
