                                               I.
        On August 5, 1997, the  Commission, pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3) of the Commissions Rules
 of Practice, suspended attorney <comp.>James P. Brown</> (Brown) from appearing or practicing before the
 Commission, with the right to apply to resume   appearing and practicing after five years.    See
 Opinion and Order, Release No.34-38903 (August 5, 1997).  The basis for the suspension was an
 action by the Commission in th e United States District Court for South Carolina ( SEC v. Policy
 Management Systems Corp , Civil Action No. 96-CV-2193), in which the Commission alleged
 Brown, an attorney licensed in Florida, was working in-house as general counsel and then as senior
 vice president for Management System Cor poration (PMSC) from <date.>1986</> though <date.>1993</>.  Brown
 reviewed financial statements contained in certain periodic reports filed on behalf of PMSC with the
 Commission, and certain of these <item.>financial statem  ents</> materially misstated PMSCs results of
 operations in violation of generally accepted accounting principles. The complaint further alleged
 that, as a control person, Brown was liable for PMSCs failure to make and keep accurate books and
 records and to maintain adequate internal accounting controls, and that Brown provided inaccurate
 information to PMSCs independent auditors. On July 22, 1997, Brown consented to the entry of
 an order of permanent injunction enjoining him from violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A),
 13(b)(2)(B) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Ac t and its Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 13b2-1 and
 13b2-2 thereunder. 

        In anticipation of the institution of these administrative proceedings, Brown consented to the
 entry of an order (as an offer of settlement) without admitting or denying the findings except as to
---------------------Page 2---------------------

the entry of the injunction and the Commissions jurisdiction over him, both of which he admitted.
Brown consented to the entry of the Order Instituting Public Proceedings Pursuant to Rule 102(e)
of the Commissions Rules of Practice, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions, which
was entered on August 5, 1997. 

       The Opinion and Order provided that Brown could apply to resume appearing and practicing
before the Commission after a period of five years.

                                              II. 

       On or about March 2, 2005, over five years after he had been suspended by the Commission,
on August 5, 1997, Brown filed an application for reinstatement to appear or practice before the
Commission, which he amended on April 21, 2005.  His application includes two personal affidavits
in which he swore under penalty of perjury that he has complied with the Commissions Opinion
and Order, that he has not appeared or practiced before the Commission and that he has not been
subject to any other disciplinary action during the  last seven years and that he personally paid a
$20,000 civil penalty in connection with the Offer of settlement in the above-referenced action in
federal court.

                                              III.

       Based on the forgoing, the Commission has determined that it is appropriate to permit
Brown, pursuant to Rule 102(e)(5), to resume appearing or practicing before the Commission. 

       Accordingly, it is HEREBY ORDERED that  Brown may resume practicing before the
Commission. 

       By the Commission.

                                                                  Jonathan G. Katz
                                                                                Secretary
