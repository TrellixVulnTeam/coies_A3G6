                                               II.  
 
       In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the 
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings 
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these 
proceedings, and the findings contained in Section III. paragraph 3 below, which are admitted, 
Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to  
Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial 
Sanctions (“Order”), as set forth below.   
 
                                              III.  
 
       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that:  
 
              1.      Korkuc, age 42, is a certified public accountant and has been licensed by the 
State of New York since 1988.  He was a Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer of <comp.>Symbol  
Technologies, Inc</>. (“Symbol”) from July 2000 until his resignation in March 2003.  Before 
becoming Chief Accounting Officer, Korkuc was Symbol’s Director of Corporate Accounting, a 
position he obtained in 1997. 
 
              2.      Symbol, a Delaware corporation with headquarters in Holtsville, New York, 
is engaged in the design, manufacture, marketing and servicing of integrated mobile and wireless  
information management systems utilizing bar code scanners and similar devices.  Symbol’s 
common stock is, and was at all times relevant to this proceeding, registered with the Commission 
pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and traded on 
the New York Stock Exchange. 
 
              3.      On June 19, 2003, th e Commission filed a complaint against Korkuc in  SEC  
v. Robert Korkuc, 03 Civ. 3017 (LDW) (E.D.N.Y.).  On May 11, 2005, the court entered a partial 
final judgment enjoining Korkuc, by consent, from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of  
1933 (“Securities Act”), Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act  and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 
and 13b2-2 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of 
the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.  The court also barred Korkuc   
from acting as an officer or director of a public company. 
 
              4.      The Commission’s comp   laint alleges, among other things, that Korkuc and 
others engaged in a fraudulent scheme to manipulate Symbol’s reported financial results to create  
the false appearance that Symbol  had met or exceeded its financial projections.  As part of the 
fraudulent scheme, Korkuc and others employed  a number of improper accounting practices that  
violated generally accepted accounting principles and resulted in, among other things, <item.>material  
overstatements of the revenue</> and <item.>net income</> that Symbol reported for annual and quarterly periods  
from <date.>1998</> through <date.>2002</>.  Among other fraudulent practices, Korkuc and others manipulated  
various “cookie jar” reserves and made other fraudulent “top side” adjustments to Symbol’s 

                                                2

consolidated financials to conform the reported results to forecasts and mark             et expectations.  As a 
result of this scheme, Symbol filed materially false and mislea         ding periodic reports, including its  
annual reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001.  Korkuc 
signed those two annual reports even though he knew that they were false and misleading, and he  
made material misstatements to accountants in connection with audits of the financial statements 
included in those reports. 
 
                                                        IV. 
                                                           
         In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
impose the sanctions agreed to in Respondent Korkuc’s Offer. 
 
         Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that Korkuc is suspended 
from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant.   
   
 
 
 By the Commission.

       Secretary                                                           

                                                         3
