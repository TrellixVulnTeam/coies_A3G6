                                               I. 
 
       The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate to issue an 
order of forthwith suspension of <comp.>Edwin Reese Davis, Jr.</> (“Respondent” or “Davis”) pursuant to

Rule 102(e)(2) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice.

P.C. (“Davis Accounting”) and Etania Audit Group P.C. (“Etania,”) both Utah companies.

       On November 4, 2010, Utah’s Division of Occupational & Professional Licensing revoked

his license had expired on September 30, 2008. 
 
       C.  Davis Continued to hold Himself out as a CPA after his Licensed was Revoked. 
        
       Despite having his license revoked, Davis continued to hold himself out to clients as a CPA 
and to prepare audit reports that were filed with the Commission.  Davis prepared at least twenty-
three audit reports that were filed with the Commission after his license had expired on September 
30, 2008. 
                                              III. 
 
       In view  of  the foregoing, the  Commission  finds that Davis’s license to practice as an 
accountant has been revoked within the meaning of Rule 102(e)(2) of the Commission’s Rules of 
Practice. 
 
       Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that Edwin Reese Davis, Jr. is forthwith suspended from 
appearing or practicing before the Commission pursuant to Rule 102(e)(2) of the Commission’s 
Rules of Practice. 
 
       By the Commission.
